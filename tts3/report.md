# Introduction

The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of decisions made in designing a plagiarism detection tool and cover different types of plagiarisms detected.

# Plagiarism types

Type 1

:   Plagiarisms of this type are exact duplicates, e.g. documents t104 and t4172 which are classified as type 1 are exactly the same, word for word.


Type 2

:   Plagiarisms of this type are near duplicates, e.g. documents t1088 and t5015 which are classified as type 2 are almost the same, except document t1088 is missing the word _room_.
