3 seems like the cleanest api for your class to if you really use myobject until declare is to me it would make sense to wrap the new and declare into a factory to make sure that users of your class try to use myobject without first calling factory methods can also help with maintenance down the way to help with testability might be to wrap the declare operation in a pluggable interface in the your production app would use an implementation of ideclarer that calls the com while your test code could plug in a mock maybe something like this probably have to tweak public ideclarer declarer private set public static myobject com stuff with myobject newmyobject new return interface myobject class comdeclarer public myobject do com return class testdeclarer public myobject do or return

a class has a constructor which throws a meaningful error message when construction fails when the score is outside a valid what do you think of that worries me a because calling a ctor requires memory which is relatively for each row calling a ctor and only for its expensive are great when you need but this is a case where you vould use them in a ctor but not in a check refactoring could reduce both by having the check exist as a class static or free then both the check constraint and the ctor could call score int static bool int score return score 0 int s s throw score constraint calls no construction or exception you still have the for each of a clr whether acceptable is something have to there a statement to with check all check constraints on all or do i have to them table by but you can do this to generate the table name with check check constraint from then run the resultset against the from the use base classes called constrainednumber and regexconstrainedstring for all my data i could easily move those two simple constructor code to a separate public boolean isvaluevalid method as you and probably clr overhead memory would only occur for inserts and given the simplicity of the and rate at which table updates will i think the performance impact will anything to worry about for my still really want to raise exceptions for the information provide to management studio i like the isvaluevalid because it gives me the of not throwing within applications using my data i could still get the exception by constructing an instance not sure i agree with the exception but the is that by decomposing the problem into you can select what parts wiling to pay without paying for parts you the ctor you because you were only calling it to get the so we decomposed creation and we can further decompose score int static bool int score return score 0 static int score s throw int s s score a user can call the and get the check and possible exception and call checkvalid and get the check and or isvalid to just get the paying the runtime cost for only what he

a cluster can also refer to a specific physical ordering of consider a database with two invoices and if many are inserted chances are that items of the same invoice end up on multiple physical blocks of the underlying when reading such an unneeded data will be read together with the interesting clustering over the foreign key to invoices groups rows of items the same invoice together in the same thus reducing the amount of necessary read operations when accessing the about on a is a number of servers configured to provide the same but look like one server to the can be done for performance reasons servers can answer more requests than a single or redundancy one server the others still configurations often need special software or setup to some like serving static web can be clustered very like need complicated replication schemes to about on a cluster is a of items so that objects from the same cluster are more similar to each other than objects from different about on

a current java project we have code similar to the following do nothing or but abort current do nothing or but abort current some more calls to different method do nothing or but abort current you can several different method are called with the exact same object and for every call the same exception is caught and handled the same in a very the exception is not but may only be logged and then only reason why there is a around every single is to always execute all of the no matter if a previously executed method like the above code at it takes up a lot of is very repetitive the logging done in the not presented and just looks can think of some other ways to write this but like them very the following options came to my sequence or daily i i try switch case case case catch do nothing or but abort current is obviously bad very and looks reflection to get objects for the methods to call and store them in a list in the order they are supposed to be then iterate over this list and call the method using as only the exception is handled inside of the like this as bugs example typos in the method only pop up during runtime and the reflection api is somewhat a functor class like class void throws create a list of objects that call the like functors new public void public void iterate this list and call on every can summarize my feeling about this approach with two code i really like all four i would like to discuss this problem what do you feel is the best how did you solve similar problems in the is there maybe a much simpler solution i missed to best execute a set of methods even if an exception

a great fan of does your method need access to the state of the if the answer is no it is probably otherwise you consider making it a static then go for access to state is less just as it is a good idea to hide private members that are not needed by other it is a good idea to hide the state from members that need reduced access can mean less it makes threading easier as it is much easier to keep static members there is also a performance consideration as the runtime does not need to pass a reference to as a parameter for static course the downside is that if you ever find that your previously static method will have to access the state for some then you have to change now i understand that this can be a problem for public apis so if this is a public method in a public then perhaps you should think about the implications of this a never faced a situtation in the real world where this actually caused a but maybe just go for by all

a pretty abstract given that both composition aggregation are pretty similar really only different conceptually and not necessarily at the code you might consider a car having an engine to be and a dog having fleas to be but nothing stopping you implementing them in the same way if you were modelling them in if you want to break down the differences try forcibly add software design decisions to highlight those differences i guess you could do something like taking example from differs from ordinary composition in that it does not imply in when the owning object is so are the contained in this is not necessarily for a university owns various departments and each department has a number of if the university the departments will no longer but the professors in those departments will continue to a university can be seen as a composition of whereas departments have an aggregation of in a professor could work in more than one but a department could not be part of more than one might build this code to represent it as many contrived indications of class university private departments new public void the university is in charge of the lifecycle of it creates them public void the the departments foreach department in class department makes no sense if it connected to exactly private university private string of professors can be added meaning that one professor a member of many departments public professors internal constructor since a department makes no sense on its should try to limit how it can be created internal string public void the but let the professors worry class

a slightly different way to look at almost never makes sense when you are passing it as a pointer into a specific collection you are passing the collection as meyer was specifically stating that cannot be used with most member functions of a collection in that you will need a if you have a handle to the the only difference between the two is that you can modify what is by an and you modify the object referenced by a you want to use whenever you are passing a collection and position into the collection to an signatures make a whole lot of the implicit statement is that is free to modify the underlying collection but is not allowed to modify what that make much if you really want then should be an offset instead of an the flip most of the algorithms in the stl are based on ranges specified by a pair of the collection itself is never passed so the difference between and is whether the value in the collection can be modified through the iterator or without a reference to the the separation is pretty that made things as clear as mud	
a small project i need to utilize a simple database with very light few no more than few thousands of records in 2 or 3 i am working in a database server those express seems like a huge overkill in this a very simple mdb database could do for most of the i am concerned about my idea is to place the file on a network share and let users access this file from their the db is mostly aimed at operations but users will occasionally need to records as if this will not be possible at the time to the db being locked or i can hold the updates on the client and process them at a later question itself goes along these are concurrent reads handled in are concurrent handled in there a concept of locks and how can i leverage it in a placing the mdb file on a network share good or horrible i am working in i would also love to know how can i detect any concurrency problems and take appropriate which exception should i catch and what action would you recommend to it may be my bad description of the but most answers seem to advise going for a full blown db i do understand the differences and benefits of having a server installation and have in fact implemented a fair number of projects on mssql and in this i am only concerned with access and its concurrency so please do not suggest a db for your access

a very good osgi citizen as many of the assumptions hibernate makes on class visibility are no longer true in an osgi usual way of loading jdbc drivers with the class work inside osgi in this hibernate will try and load the driver but find it as hibernate import the jdbc driver jdbc driver manager also tries to be smart by working out whether the calling class loader should see the driver and this also conflicts with you use spring to configure hibernate then i suggest you use the class as this works in osgi and spring allows you to configure hibernate with a concrete data source rather than passing a class name that hibernate needs to you get past that problem probably run into the issues of hibernate not seeing your domain i only have experience with the xml mapping with i think is simpler in osgi as i think the annotations way requires aop weaving of some sort and another current with the unless you use something like dm server need to become much more familiar with class loading mechanism and how you can use approach to services to work around the incompatibilities between vanilla java and the osgi look into how enterprise libraries use the context class loader and how you can manage i am using spring dm to wrap legacy code in osgi services as this makes it easy to control the context class

a way to automatically block browser requests hitting your server side but there are ways to identify which scripts have been triggered by your application and which is usually done using something called the basic idea is that the page making the ajax request should generate a unique token is typically a hash of unix timestamp salt this token and timestamp should be passed as parameters to the ajax the ajax handler script will first check this token the validity of the unix timestamp if it falls within 5 minutes of the token if the token checks you can then proceed to fulfill this this token generation checking can be coded up as an apache module so that it is triggered automatically and is separate from the application scripts be able to generate valid tokens they figure out your and so you can safely ignore in mind that storing a token in the session is also another but that buy any more security than your authentication

added to the dict argument in so that the compiler warns me if i try to change the address dict is pointing that case you meant not dict declared the struct as not the pointer to do i also need to have const for otherwise you could use currptr to modify the dictionary struct which is supposed to be const in this line currptr is changing the currptr why the compile warn me about that if i added a const to not an error if the const is in the place you put it would be if the const were in the other place for i be able to access the dictionary in the main program cause i lost the address i was pointing when the main program calls it passes a pointer value into the and this becomes the value of dict in the get but get has its own pointer separate from the one in the main even if they just so happen to both be called changing one pointer change the variables point to the same so if you use the variable to modify any of the fields in the then of course the results will affect both bits of a function called would be a so right to make the parameter dict but i think the reason this is is slightly different from what you to protect the contents of the dictionary from not to protect your record of the address of is slightly awkward for linked lists like this even when you have a const its field still point to so although you modify the first the protect you from modifying other nodes in the addresses this with function so you can have a function which returns a const output if the input is but a output if the input is you could achieve a similar thing in c with a and the latter having a const parameter and but most people including standard library functions like which in c takes const but returns strchr can therefore be accidentally used in c to convert a const string into a without any or in which case a bit like laundering money through a business function does not require me to add a const before currptr and confess stumped on i would expect the same warning as in are you sure it but the parameter to del be const because potentially modifying the

afraid that because a browser feature to refresh the why you set the cron job to run more frequently that every 5 there is no other option then you could create own daemon to do the job more php script 60 two more variation of version of the script will remain resident for four and execute the code 4 times which would be equivalent to running every if this script is run by cron every 5 seems some confusion about what a cronjob and how it is is a which sits in the and run tasks through the shell at a schedule specified in user has a and there is a system crontab can specify jobs which are run as that run five minutes after every 0 run at on the first of every month output mailed to 14 1 run at 10 pm on annoy 22 mail are your echo 23 minutes after 4am 4 sun echo at 5 after 4 every to run every five echo will be run every five to run every echo will be run every output from the commands are emailed to the owner of the crontab as specified by means if you run something every minute it will email you every unless you ensure all normal output is suppressed or commands are run as the user who owns the which contrasts with the scripts run by the which are run as the user similar whatever the is configured to run can make life more complicated if the cronjob is writing to files which are supposed to be accessed by the scripts run by the basically you have to ensure that the permissions remain not sure that this is the system you are refering if you mean something else by then the above might not you want to do something that your current host is not letting you then rather than hacking around the you might what to look at switching hosting alternative is to put the script in normal scripts and have some external scheduler run wget against it at whatever frequency you alternative is updating of the form of however that may not solve your

almost certainly nothing faster than the machine code neg instruction that your compiler will most likely turn this there sure the compiler would use a you could not it and add 1 but almost certainly going to be but not entirely certain that the standards mandate the use of i think this question belongs with those that attempt to rewrite et al to get more those people naively assume that the c library already heavily optimized by using special machine code instructions than a simplistic loop that would be most first you run performance tests which seem to indicate that your negations are taking an overly long neg on a 486 of the art the last time i had to clock takes 3 clock cycles only takes assuming the later chips will on a 3ghz that means you can do 1 billion every is that not fast

alone is not a framework just a template system but with some very cool got own structure and you can embed perl code very easely in it also got cache seen people who use mason alone for developing a large but i guess it works better in an mvc	
along the lines of how do it but the issue you will have is cross thread access when your database connection does succeed and you need to update your as cms suggests you could use the backgroundworker class and have it take care of the marshalling for i tend to go for more fine grained control and i would implement you example void rdt new void if else void eventargs try catch ignore connection just display data

also taking a attitude about mvc with the entity framework and wpf for diff a huge fan of mvc in general but am a little concerned about wrapping something as general purpose as a web development framework into the constraints of one a very useful pattern but still only 1 of skilled developer can implement mvc in practically any so mvc may be a great way to prevent developers all this at some like when just learning a from making egregious since the pattern works well in a wide range of scenarios that could make it a net the other for expert developers it may turn out to be like training wheels on an olympic redundant and more of a pain than a	
also that some browsers start displaying anything until the body of the response contains a certain amount of data like 256 or 1024 i have seen applications before that pad data with a 1024 character long comment near the top of the before they do a a bit of a but applies to internet explorer and safari it is the first make sure you have output at least 1024 bytes sofar including http you can determine that there is output buffering in issue like to just the start of my script and then i want to this assumes that you want any output buffering at even if it was set up before your script as in a or htaccess

also think unit tests are they have their but what really increases the quality of a program is to review on the other hand really fond of but they replace unit not talking about but simply reread what you possibly while stepping through it with a debugger and checking that each line does what supposed to do will sky rocket software recommend unit tests that test a chunk of functionality rather than a tiny method the later tend to make any code change extremely painful and	
also this macro

also use and like peter becker we use the comments to describe the work on a this usually because most bugs have such a long work on a bug becomes so complex it needs its own meetings and meeting we usually create a task in our main work planning system and do the discussion there from that at least works for any be wary of a system that tries to explicitly support a certain as these also tend to lock you into the workflow they an in the workflow can vary a lot from bug to note that mantis also lets you edit your so you can change old comments to avoid cluttering the bug

alternative approach to my other have the observer hold a pointer to the model at pass a into the update which is called by the this would need to know what model it is notifying but that probably difficult given that embedded in a so probably always that the observer then needs a model in setmodel you can still give it but more likely is that get rid of setmodel and just call instead of but less you could leave things as they are but declare then you can use amodel as a model in but no other method of the observer can modify the of these changes will work if the observer is expected to be able to unregister itself without a parameter to use to do

always best to load as much as is reasonable on the initial if your requires that you add stuff dynamically via ajax then i can see you what i you are wondering what the practice would be to keep your javascript concise and in on file and not scattered throughout your you are saying that currently your scripts are scattered throughout your page because when you are loading in or whatever they have the js along with them so that when they load their script is run the problem is that you want specific events to be triggered instantiating a lightbox or sorting a when these views are loaded by using the one omnipotent super global js if that sounds then what do any views being loaded in assume you have the code you you loaded some content into the div a when the page is fully and then you wanted to sort that table without putting the script to do so in the html that is returned from you could have the following code in you main or whatever your sorting method uses jquery custom events and the i tested this out but it should work in i tested this and it works perfectly using jquery

always stick with and i always seed the sequence high enough so that they will all have a consistent number of digits seems to be less also sometimes start an order say 6 starting at and customer numbers at 5 starting at which would for example give me unique customer numbers and unique order numbers to and you could always tell just by looking at it whether it was a customer number or an order so if a customer rep was asking for a number over the phone it would immediately be obvious which was would not however build logic in the app that would depend on so even if it did roll the system

am not sure what do you think by the contents present in my but that kind of problem is solved using automation such tools can grab anything in windows environment from window button text everything you may need to get from 3thd party application pictures of gui suggest you take a look at scripting language for windows cant do this in a content of a window in autohotkey can be as simple of the can get a bit more complicated then but nothing you may want involve more then 10 lines of ahk is the best approach becuase it depend on features of the given tso once you learn you can obtain any information from the system in uniform in mind that some applications are using non standard windows components and that they may not be automatable is rare the community forum there are lots of usefull functions and libraries for basically anything you may need in order to get info redirection of to your com accesibilty module way to automate things in even some ocr wrappers to scan information pictured on

am posting this as an answer so i can explain how i did it and the answer from mitch wheat was the one that gave me the best solution for this case and i just had to modify it slightly due to the format this data was exported is the vb fixedcontents as string addressof regex that was used is what i needed to change because certain fields had quotes in them and the regex provided seem to work on all this one uses and to see if the quote is just after a comma or just in this they are both negative show me where the double quote is not before or after a this should mean that the quote is in the middle of a this instead of doing a direct i am using the function replacequotes to handle that for the reason i am using this is because i needed a little extra logic to detect whether it was at the beginning of a if i would have spent even more time on i am sure i could have tweaked the regex to take into consideration the beginning of the line but when i tried it it seem to work at this in using csv reader on a 32mb csv file 19000 it takes about 2 seconds to read the perform the load it into the csv add all the data to my generic class and real

an answer because too much to say for a comment question author studio express is not offering all this tools as which i asked express provide that you reply was unit documenting if i am think that you get what you want with visual studio see my conclusions studio deployment projects are certainly missing from visual studio but frankly not much of an the whole feature is half good enough to tick off a feature good enough for toy deployments but my opinion not really up to the rigors of the real installer is an open source toolkit from microsoft not a for creating the installer for microsoft office 2007 was built with so reasonable to believe that it can handle any smaller installation tool is the scriptable install perhaps easier to understand than but also not using with the msi technology built into windows and therefore harder to manage in the enterprise microsoft testing framework is and while up to the not the leader of the in if you google around for reactions to find many who think it a ripoff of was a time that you could integrate any of the test tools into visual studio using though that no longer work is to use the external runner programs for your unit testing tool all of the major unit testing frameworks come with when using vs express i tend to have the test runner hanging around in the rerunning tests then just involves a task is the grandaddy of the testing and it works very there are others around such as and version of visual studio has a good story for in they all have the a compiler switch to generate xml files based on the documentation convert those xml files into real you need other used to be the but that project is unfortunately now dead a sad microsoft open source is likely to become the new gold but the tool yet as mature and easy to use as we would is a new release in this might be worth you can there are good ways to achieve the goals you even using visual studio in there are only two things gain from moving up to a paid version of visual get if you want be able install like and someone getting i think the value proposition is start with the free tools and spend money when you have enough experience to spend it

an attributes are a form of metadata that you can attach to various code assemblies attributes have special meaning to the for instance the probably tells the compiler to emit some code that can serialize an instance of the class say since i do not know the inner workings of the can also create your own attributes inheriting using reflection you could then at extract information from the simple example would be to create an attribute to specify what kind of input field to use in a html form when displaying an chapter on overview	
an do not lend well to this is documented in the flex 3 help on to functions objects and when defining a data binding expression that uses an array as the source of a data binding the array should be of type because the class dispatches an event when the array or the array elements change to trigger data for a call to and all trigger data	
an easy language to learn as noted by everyone but there are a few reasons that it makes a decent place to tie you to a specific programming paradigm java and so you can experiment with different techniques have the bells and whistles so you can concentrate on making the building blocks if you want to know how they are it is a language and not a you can choose the library or libraries that best fit the task at hand or your chosen programming style choosing something like for a javaesque for the gritty early style is a general purpose programming not a platform to say that trick is learning it carefully and correctly the first i know that like many have struggled with it by learning it as before really understanding it is a hard language to i would recommend looking for an experienced mentor to attach yourself to as well as reading a lot of the books on how to and how not to write avoid learning bad habits up a starting reading list in no particular by koenig and by scott software by bertrand c by peter van der tutorial and reference by and standard by

answer but this is more intuitive for image for id for the script part that is being inserted with check out	
answer given by covers pretty well most part of the i will now deal with the very last paragraph as simply as i should be implemented for for your derived class to be reused in old not for your class reusing parts of the base class can use aggregation for that if you have a class that is to be used on new code with some new but should be used transparently as a former then inheritance is your new code can use the new functionality and old code will seamlessly use your new this is the general there are some common the line here is subtle and your question is about precisely that if you have a collection of objects of type that should be because those objects are meant to be used only with they are behave like techniques as or downcasts in to detect the real runtime type is something that i would flag in a code review and only accept after having the programmer explain to great detail why any other option is worse than that i would accept for in answer under the premises that the information is not available with the given operations in that the base type does not have any method that would offer enough information for the caller to determine the and if it does not make sense to include such besides the prepresentation are you going to perform any operation on the objects based on that same if logic depends on the real then the operation should be in base class to be overriden in derived if that is not possible operation is new and only for some given there should at least be an operation in the base to allow the caller to determine that a downcast will not and then i would really require a sound reason for the caller code to require knowledge of the real why does the user want to see it in different will the user perform different operations on each one of the you endup requiring to use code to bypass the type your design has a strange to of never say but you can surely avoid depending on or downcasts for

answer is right on recommending you let the parallel nature of web requests handle much of your parallelism for you if the environment place had great success using the parallel extensions was in loading data from remote i had an app where need to fetch one piece of use some information from that to fetch 30 and return the i ran the first fetch then defined a future the parallel for each other request i included the little bit of processing i needed in the anonymous and did a on the array of very simple to and all the requests at least several of them at a run in parallel to fetch their especially since the latency for my calls was very high wait for about 1kb of this technique worked i even modified it to return an and used to wait for one of the futures to then yielded it from my allowing the caller to start processing the results from some of the requests before they all were

answer is ultimately correct rewrite your app to launch sometimes not a practical for example loading code later in the application may take too long a data acquisition forcing it to be loaded at if you decide that you want to show a splash the easiest way is to show it in the application create a splash window in your applications and add an outlet to your app delegate referencing that you can then put the window onscreen in and hide it in note that the main nsrunloop is not iterating during this so if you want to update the splash screen a progress or need to manage those redraw events think very hard about whether the long startup is if it showing a splash screen a progess is the minimum that you owe your	
answer is when a closure captures a variable in is what is happening when your lambda refers to the variable the compiler applies a pretty precise rule about how to do the if the captured variable is within the same as determined by the surrounding and then the value of that variable will be captured as it if it is outside the then only a reference to that variable will be in your original the variable had already cycled through the entire loop to its last but if you make the modification mehrdad then you are capturing a variable in your same so the individual value of the variable will be embedded into your giving you the results you the you may but the variable is in the same but not because under the the compiler turns a into something like this is very just to show what happens with the var iterator your loop code your iterator for a will always be in a scope outside of the one where your loop code

answer locking is necessary if only both threads can use the same shared resources at the same there enough information about your specific but i have few only during writing makes no it only adds some but not prevent from any concurrent access until the reader is also correctly would be necessary if file operations which modify structures connected with the descriptors are not synchronized in any it may happen that p1 could start writing to the file when p2 is still if reading and writing operations modify the same system structures without any underlying synchronization you will end up with corrupted hard to say if this is the case here because you mention which particular function you file operations are synchronized on most so it be a what you wrote about bytes portions of the explicit locking seems to be not necessary impose p1 produces quantum of when the data is ready to be read p1 notifies p2 about that the event passing should be internally p2 knows that it could read quantum of data and then needs to wait for subsequent it may happen that subsequent notification would be sent before previous one is the events needs to be queued you can also use semaphore instead of events	
answer might be somehow off but could still contain some useful you can connect to a web using that for feeding reporting services with data from a web service based the is built on sql server and and are using ssrs for its have recently upgraded both the database as well as the reporting server to 2008 and since then i actually have had several problems with the web service based know if just bids 2008 that are or if it is my automatically converted report projects from bids 2005 that are to or if something is wrongly configured on the server for example i am not able to update the query fields in my forced to manually add new query also not able to make a query with the query designer which were possible in bids 2005 on the data tab i really miss in bids 2008 by the also seem to be alot of other things that really work as expected compared to the 2005 be honest i tried to build a new report from so that may solve some of my the preview mode in bids 2008 and the published reports works

answer to this lies in two are the two types of objects and simply two sides of the same coin or are they fundamentally and does it result in a more sensible database have to consider the impact both from a business logic standpoint and from a core rdbms is there value in being able to define foreign keys in the transaction table to both the customer and the supplier you really going to be doing searches in your application where a customer result and a supplier result would be if i would recommend just creating a a view that unions the common parts and keep the tables bear in mind that other such as an address or phone can be stored in other discreet so a lot of the common information will be refactored away	
answer to your question really depends upon the purpose of your regular expressions are great and i with all the previous answers i have regular is a quick and sleak way to validate certain inputs but perhaps what you need to remember what makes good code and apply the regular expressions in the correct i read the article you and i thought the subject matter was about more about using regular expressions in the correct manner just use them for a solution because you know it will be quick to type up and it will work but in turn produces lengthy and horrible looking take it from what is written that regular expressions are i he just wanted to put accross that sometimes you can spend a few more minutes considering design and come up with a better concept to implement or just conclude that regular expressions are that	
answer uses sql server so i thought put in my tuppence worth using something more to delete all the but not the you need a way of differentiating the duplicate records from each part of would appear that in your case the source data has no identity column create one in the temp if that is the there are two choices that come to my add the identity column to the then remove the create a set of delete everything from the and insert the data back into the 1 could be something the newly created id as id code and alpha3code and relatedyear as as group on and and and

answers address the way the reference count is stored is stored in a shared memory for all that hold the same native but most elude the problem of easiest way of leaking memory with reference counted pointers is creating as an a doubly linked list where all the pointers are with at least two elements is guaranteed not to be even if external pointers are the internal pointers will still and the reference count will not reach that at with the most easiest solution to the cycle problem is mixing counted with weak pointers that do not share the ownership of the pointers will share both the resource and the additional when you use weak the reference count is there is a shared pointer reference count and a weak pointer reference the resource is released whenever the shared pointer count reaches but the information is left alive until the last weak pointer is the doubly linked the external reference is held in a while the internal links are just whenever there are no external references the elements of the list are deleting the weak at the end all weak references have been deleted and the last weak pointer to each resources frees the is less confusing than the above text try again

anything you have to understand that everything about parsing is based on describe the language you want to implement in terms of how to decompose the text in basic units and how to stack those units in some meaning ful you may also want to look for the between ll and lr can be of two implementation and grammar writing if you use a standard tool you only need to understand the second usually use ll they are simpler to write and to implement even using custom grammars theoretically cover more kinds of languages but in a normal situation they are just a hindrance when you need some correct error random gnu version of the venerable

append content to a you should only call during the parsing you have a call to somewhere where it executes outside that such as in your event there is no parsing going so nowhere for that string to should happen according to the javascript handlers execute after the original document so the write method implicitly opens a new document of mimetype if you do not explicitly issue a method in the event it assumes made a mistake and meant to replaces the entire document with new also notice that because you finish that off by the throbber is still expecting more content to be written to the document it never this you are a how are you is clearly not a valid html chrome which behaves the is trying to parse it as an html but fails because it is text content outside the document element which is not if you put some tags in the name how are you see everything outside the element is firefox and ie manage to apply their up text outside any to save but chrome you want to a new you should make sure it is indeed a complete how are you if you want to a text you should theoretically the but the mimetype parameter is not supported by chrome or always treat what you write as any probably want to be using this if you want to add to the existing page you should normally be using dom such as setting the text on a status output or replacing the body contents using is needed in a few places when you are creating a new window or frame from but otherwise generally the wrong thing and should be viewed with	
application delegate is not an application it should inherit from not that is a its method always returns the first nsapplication or any throwing away any subsequent objects you the nib may be calling you ended up setting your application object as its own the object you intended to make the delegate died in the second call to and the application object took its the application object to be an instance of your subclass would also have but still have the application as its own which is unclean and possibly dangerous may privately implement some of its delegate methods as just notification handler the only correct solution is to make your app delegate class not inherit from	
application i am working on is suffering from a slow memory i have used cdb with sos to try to determine what is happening but the data does not seem to make any sense so i was hoping one of you may have experienced this application is running on the 64 bit it is continuously calculating and serialising data to a remote host and is hitting the large object heap a fair most of the loh objects i expect to be once the calculation is complete and has been sent to the remote the memory should be what i am is a large number of object arrays interleaved with free blocks of taking a random segment from the 000000005b5b1000 address mt 0000064280c7c970 00000000001661d0 1901752 00000642788d8ba8 1056 00000000001661d0 5988848 00000642788d8ba8 00000000001661d0 6481336 00000642788d8ba8 00000000001661d0 7346016 00000642788d8ba8 00000000001661d0 7611648 00000642788d8ba8 00000000001661d0 264808 i would expect this to be the case if my application were creating large objects during each does do this and i accept there will be a degree of loh fragmentation but that is not the problem the problem is the very small object arrays you can see in the above dump which i cannot see in code being created and which are remaining rooted note that cdb is not reporting the type when the heap segment is i am not sure if this is related or if i dump the marked reports it rank number of elements type elements of the object array are all strings and the strings are recognisable as from our application i am unable to find their gc roots as the command hangs and never comes back have even tried leaving it i would very much appreciate it if anyone could shed any light as to why these small object arrays are ending up on the what situations will put a small object array in does anyone happen to know of an alternative way of ascertaining the roots of these in theory i came up with late yesterday is that these object arrays started out large but have been shrunk leaving the blocks of free memory that are evident in the memory what makes me suspicious is that the object arrays always appear to be 1056 bytes long 128 8 for the references and 32 bytes of idea is that perhaps some unsafe code in a library or in the clr is corrupting the number of elements field in the array bit of a long shot i to brian rasmussen accepted the problem has been identified as fragmentation of the loh caused by the string intern i wrote a quick test application to confirm void const int iterations for index index string str for index index string str application first creates and dereferences unique strings in a this is just to prove that the memory does not leak in this obviously it should not and it does the second unique strings are created and this action roots them in the intern what i did not realise is how the intern table is it appears it consists of a set of pages object arrays of 128 string elements that are created in the this is more evident in sos of gc 0 starts at 1 starts at 2 starts at segment allocation segment begin allocated 00b21000 010029bc object heap starts at segment begin allocated 01b21000 01b8ade0 size heap size a dump of the loh segment reveals the pattern i saw in the leaking 01b21000 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 free total 1568 mt count totalsize class 784 12544 784 421088 1568 that the object array size is 528 than because my workstation is 32 bit and the application server is 64 the object arrays are still 128 elements the moral to this story is to be very careful if the string you are interning is not known to be a member of a finite set then your application will leak due to fragmentation of the at least in version 2 of the our there is general code in the deserialisation code path that interns entity identifiers during i now strongly suspect this is the the intentions were obviously good as they wanted to make sure that if the same entity is deserialised multiple times then only one instance of the identifier string will be maintained in object heap	
application projects are like any other visual studio they have a project file or which is an msbuild description of how to build the this is how web applications were built on since day visual studio microsoft decided that this was too they got rid of web application projects and replaced them with web site these are not actually but are rather a collection of files in a folder on on an ftp on were loudly informed of their and quickly came out with visual studio 2005 which put web application projects back in the where they are to this and always will code in a web application project all gets compiled into a single the code in a web site is only compiled when it is this can be a benefit during development working on one and actually find it sort of cool to be able to change some save then press f5 in the browser to see the the other what working on now actually a web site not a product that needs to be packaged up and shipped to i may be but i like the idea that my code compile before i ship it to i was taught hard to test what i

approaches to copy objects in java have serious method is so you call it directly unless the class in question overrides it with a public call the any it will allocate assign the internal field you can read via and copy the fields of the more issues with see item 11 of joshua book second is even it has many of the flaws of and then joshua has a whole chapter with four items for this topic solution is add a new interface to my interface t copy t createforcopy void copyto code looks like demo implements public demo copy demo copy createforcopy copyto return public void createforcopy return new demo public void copyto fields of demo i have to copy this code to all my objects but always the same so i can use an eclipse editor can decide which constructor to call and how to initialize which happens in a deterministic order class to instance can reuse existing objects and overwrite stay standard java types i use a utility class which can copy the methods have flags and so i can control how deep a copy should

architectural point of view i would say you are about to break the it might be a bad decision providing resource dictionary with notion of ui that consumes it and giving some logic other than providing might want some adapter between ui and resource or controller if this is really needed to wire resource dictionary but again you inject any logic in a resource	
architecture usually has each layer separated by the the presentation layer is on some web then that talks to backend app servers over the network for business then that talks to a database again over the and maybe the app server also calls out to some remote services for payment is a programming design pattern where different portions of code are responsible for representing the and controller in some these two things are related for instance the model layer may have an internal implementation that calls a database for storing and retrieving the controller may reside on the and remotely call appservers to retrieve mvc abstracts away the details of how the architecture of an app is just refers to the physical structure of an these two are sometimes confused because an mvc design is often implemented using an	
are 2 main approaches to building an rcp app you are using rcp just for the platform features the application code will be isolated from rcp conventions and libraries as much as possible for the actual app biz your app is completely immersed in you try to reuse rcp wherever possible have tried out option in this the experience is very similar to java you might want to try this option the advantages are swt is very well integrated into you dont need to run into hoops to get it i would recommend swt over swing any day as it is very easy for an average programmer to create a responsive and swt app while it takes a swing expert to create a decent swing app with a client the ability to is very eclipse automatically offers this stuff you still need to learn how the eclipse classloader this is to ensure you can explicitly load resources from your jars in the correct way it is not you will need to package the jvm along with the and invoke the jvm on startup using relative naming	
are 3 types of such as warnings or fatal errors raised by 404 errors are also in this errors by a malformed or failed query or database errors such as when something went wrong in the internal working of your application not related to a server or for example if you expected a certain file to be in a given but it best way to create an class that handles all three types of for system you would use or read up on one of the online tutorials such as i suggest using a centralized database class which handles all the use something like logical such as the error of not finding an expected file or database you would call up the same errorhandler class and do something bad the and constants will give exactly the location where this error read up on them on the class can log all errors to a log email or even you on your it could also be used to redirect the user to an error

are a couple different answers to this and it is a bit but some reasons i can think of are classes are reference if using 16 bytes for total probably not worth it to create memory references to 8 for each you have really small they can often be pushed onto the il instead of references to the this can really speed up some as eliminating a memory dereference on the callee is a bit of extra associated with classes in and if your data structure is very none of this fluff would be used so just extra junk you most important difference between a struct and a is that structs are value type and classes are reference	
are a few different the content by looking for a magic number at the start of the for gif uses gif87 or gif89 as the first five bytes of the file unfortunately this tell you if an error in the image or if the image contains malicious here are some magic numbers for various types of image files free to use the content like this is probably going to fit your requirements only have to read and therefore download the first few bytes of the file the the image using the gd library to see if it loads without this can tell you if the image is without error or unfortunately this probably fit your requirements because it requires downloading the complete you really want to make an http request for the image at then this rules out both sniffing and getting http you try to determine whether something is an image by the context in which it is something linked using a src attribute in an element is almost certainly an image an attempt at but another this will tell you if something is intended as an it tell you whether the image is actually or have to fetch at least the first small part or magic of the image url to find it is possible for a file to be both a valid image as well as a zip file containing harmful content which could be executed as java by a harmful site see gifar you can almost certainly prevent this vulnerability by loading the image in a library like gd and performing some filter on like softening or sharpening it a tiny amount using a convolution and saving it to a fresh file transferring any metadata to determine if something is an image by its alone is quite almost as unreliable as checking the file when loading an image using an browsers sniff for a magic

are four basic this is the least maintainable but easiest to i personally consider use of to be a element at the top of the this is slightly better than because it keeps the markup however it wastes bandwidth and makes it harder to make sweeping css because you look at the and know what rules this lets you have the clean html clean main css it means your client must download lots of little css which increases bandwidth and page loading it very easy to big the main advantage of one big file is that only one thing to this is much more efficient in terms of bandwidth and you have any programming going you might be able to just dynamically combine multiple sheets from to get the effect of would recommend one big whether you actually maintain it as one file or generate the file through a build process or dynamically on the you can specify your selectors using ids include just in for the that was accepted when i wrote i disagree with finding a of classes that gives you the result you this sounds to me like the classes are identifying a visual style instead of a logical your classes should be something like and not then if you need to change the text colour on the user info you can say h1 color start applying classes all over the place because a class currently has a certain appearance that you you should put concepts into your represented by html with and then style those not the other way

are is too wide a characterization to be if you ignore the differences in relative peformance offered by different regex how efficient your regex is still depends upon the complexity of the regex is efficient when it fails rather than succeeds to match a portion of text it needs to be specific enough so that text that going to match completely should be rejected early on in the matching process rather than reaching the this also means that backtracking needs to be note that backtracking can reach which would result even the best regex engine freezing in the example provided by jan the size of the file even mentioned and is not it is the size of the string which a discussion i started on a few years ago that attempted to get people discussing about performance of regular it does have a few pointers to learn i

are many more congestion control algorithms than you mention off the top of my head the list are also small variations of them due to bug fixes in actual implementations and guess that implementations in different oses also behave slightly different from one if i need to try to come up with an idea it would be to estimate the rtt of the you can try to look at the time it took between the third and the fourth as the first and second packets may be tainted by arps and other discovery algorithms along the you have an estimate for rtt you could try to refine it along the not exactly sure how you could do that but you require a full spec for the just ideas the rtt figured out you can try to put the packets into rtt bins and count the number of in flight data packets in each this way be able to of packets in to time and try some pattern matching alternative would be to go along the trace and try to in your head the different congestion control algorithms and see if the decision at any point matches with the decision you would have it will require some leniency and accuracy definitely sounds like an interesting and challenging

are the and of maintaining a pool of frequently used objects and grab one from the pool instead of creating a new something like string interning except that it will be possible for all class example it can be considered to be good since it saves gc time and object creation on the other hand it can be a synchronization bottleneck if used from multiple demands explicit deallocation and introduces possibility of memory by tying up memory that could be it places additional pressure on the garbage	
are the best practices for design by contract college i learned the design by contract an oo learned three ways to tackle the problem total programming covers all possible exceptional cases in nominal programming only the right effects when the preconditions are effect is defensive programming use exceptions to signal illegal invocations of we have focussed in different oo scenarios on the correct use in each but we learned when to use the tactics where inforced by the i think very very strange that i asked my teacher then during noone i never use nominal and tend to replace preconditions with exceptions i rather use throws than stating divider should differ from and only program total what makes sense i return a conventional value on division by but this method is just based on personal findings and i am asking you guys there any best are the best practices for design by contract

are two one from ssms and the other using sql server 2008 books move an existing index to a different filegroup or object connect to an instance of the sql server engine and then expand that expand the database that contains the table the specific and then the table in which the index belongs and then expand the index to be moved and then select the index properties dialog select the storage the filegroup in which to move the cannot move indexes created a unique or primary key constraint using the index properties dialog to move these you need drop the constraint using alter with the constraint option and then the constraint on the filegroup using alter with the add the table or index is select the partition scheme in to move the sql server to place an existing table on a different filegroup expand the database containing and then click the details the and then click design any and then click the tables in the table filegroup select the filegroup on which to place the in the text filegroup select a filegroup on which to place any and text more effective way is create a clustered index on if the table already has clustered you can use create index clause to recreate clustered index and move it to particular when a table a clustered the leaf level the index and the data pages of table essentially become one and the table must exist where clustered index so if create or recreate a the index on particular moving table to the new filegroup as can create the clustered index specifying the new filegroup for the on clause and that will move the table but if you have nonclustered indexes and want them on the other filegroup you must drop and recreate them also specifying the new filegroup in the on

are two primary ways to make a control automatically resize based on size changes of the parent container form in your the dock property of the control to the anchor property to the dock property with advantage of this method is that it takes the entire control and tells it to always fill the entire client area of the parent container your the form client useful if you want to do something like fill a form with a listcontrol or treeview or something like but not as useful if you want to scale a single control while using other controls you indicate is your in that you would need to set the dock property on those other controls to or to have them float above or below your main resizing a hassle and it also limits the layout options of the other you can mitigate that problem by docking two panel one at the top and another at the bottom of the those panels will remain in fixed positions while the middle area your scales with the parent you can then put any controls in any layout configuration in those and kind of composite using docked panels is incredibly quite it was game changing in when they introduced this with the anchor property with all you want to do is have a single control on a form while others stay to the use the anchor for the controls that you want to stay at the set the anchor property to for controls that you want to stay at the set the anchor property to for controls that you want to grow in width with the as a textbox set the anchor property to set top or bottom depending whether you want it move as the top or the bottom of the dialog if you want a control to resize in all directions with a set the anchor property to very useful for type of such as a dominant tree or what you mess with the autosize or those properties control how a control changes size based on its own not how it resizes based on its think of mode as inward while are outward you get some very bizarre behavior if you use both sizing methods at the same generally not

are two timer related functions on the windows settimer and killtimer the names are odd createtimer and destroytimer would be more as in createwindow and but that is what is can function in one of two the timer event can trigger a user defined callback or it can post a message to a the format of this function settimer use a settimer get a message to a settimer both the calling thread needs to have a message queue as both variants issue a the default handler calls the callback on the os using the value of interval has upper and lower the api for more release the timer after finished with it do the following if you provided a window is if you used a single window can have many timers associated with use a different for each reusing an stops the first instance of the timer without posting the fairly easy to latency between interval end and processing of resolution is requires a message processing

are useful when you want to mock an interaction between an object and one of its however there is less value in an interface for an object which has internal say i have a service which talks to a repository in order to extract some domain object in order to manipulate it in some is definite design value in extracting an interface from the my concrete implementation of the repository may well be strongly linked to nhibernate or by linking my service to the interface i get a clean separation from this implementation it just so happens that i can also write super fast standalone unit tests for my service now that i can hand it a mock the domain object which came back from the repository and which my service acts there is less when i write test for my i will want to use a real domain object and check its after the call to i want to check that something was added to the domain i can test this by simple inspection of the state of the domain when i test my domain object in i need interfaces as i am only going to perform operations on the object and quiz it on its internal is it valid for my sheep to eat grass if it is the first we are interested in based interfaces help because we want to intercept the calls passing between the object under test and its collaborators with in the second case we are interested in based interfaces help try to be conscious of whether you are testing state or interactions and let that influence your interface or no interface that you have a copy of resharper it is extremely cheap to extract an interface it is also cheap to delete the interface and revert to a simpler class hierarchy if you decide that you need that interface after my advice would be to start without interfaces and extract them on demand when you find that you want to mock the you bring ioc into the then i would tend to extract more interfaces but try to keep a lid on how many classes you shove into your ioc in you want to keep these restricted to largely stateless service

array in c is essentially a variables are find the first example a tad more simple to read because im not questioning what is if and had better names i would venture to say the second example would improve	
array is a contiguous block of memory devoted to n items of the same where n is a fixed number indicating the number of in order to expand an array they are fixed in you can use the c function in you can manually an array by creating a larger array and copying the contents of the old array into the new one expensive languages have options that supplant arrays as to overcome the inherent limitations of in you can use the standard template library for this the stl data type is a typical replacement for standard arrays in apis like mfc have constructs like the carraylist for a richer array usage	
array is an ordered list of all of the same indexed by see in in note that in fortran array indexing is more flexible than most other low level in that instead of a single index per you can have an index triplet consisting of lower upper and in that case the lvalue of the expression is a subarray rather than a single element of the array derived type is a composite type defined by the which is made up of multiple components which can be of different in some other languages these are knows as structure or record see in in can also make an array of a derived or you can have a derived type where one or more components are themselves or for that other derived up to easiest way to check your code is to try to compile making it past the compiler is of course no guarantee that the program works as but it certainly is a required

believe the java stack is actually very there are a few reasons explaining the low productivity of java enterprise it is often used to create applications in tend not to attract great who love and think and care about what they the quality of software in the enterprise world is not the enterprise stack where the money software vendors try to sell something to they create complex and expensive solutions not because they are but simply because they could sell them to are often very risk averse and everything they do better be standards are created either some technology proved to be successful or in both bad for enterprises enterprises end up using either good technology too late or a downright failed the latter case is also very dangerous because it creates a false perception that a technology a complete must be good if it is standardized and everyone is using java ee platform seemed to have attracted a lot of architecture astronauts and developers in big companies promoted to architects whose only purpose was to create more more more abstractions and more not that there are no good java tools and that there are too many bad too many too many bureaucratic processes and too many useless such a messy world not just the particular selection of tools you choose that affects your mainly about about your about how you can reject the majority of solutions proposed to you by the and about you going against the about common about questioning every mainstream belief and tools alone are not going to change your productivity and the right people can be productive with inferior tools use a technology only because because everyone uses or because officially recommended by use a technology only if you personally think the best tool for your this way you may find yourself rejecting technologies such as web it use your common question do you really need to publish your objects for remote do you really need to create another abstraction layer so that you can switch from hibernate to do you really need to convert your data xml ten times every time you need do you really need xml do you really need everything to be configurable are at by the process be do you really need that do you really need to describe every screen in a huge have it type it in to some tool and then generate do you have competent programmers or you design everything first and programmers only to design of html programming in general this includes as and as programming drawing page flow code generation is a framework prior to using always a frameworks that have only little xml for low loc look at actual in your is every character what can you do to make your code do you need that what does it why do you need to do is not sacred you need 100 test test only what makes if difficult to make it or test it at test visual some concrete java presentation layer try why do i love because with tapestry you can create beautiful designed specifically for so that code can be by beautiful i mean everything that matters easy to easy to easy to create your and still it try to hide the fact that you are developing for the of still who makes your code free to use especially for crud and large bother with not a silver bullet with orm you are always going to trade one set of problems with a little you need much since carefully avoided all the java ee use dependency injection all of you may find the java language too verbose and not very helpful when abstracting away you if you want to try the problem is that the main selling point of scala is that you get all the benefits of modern languages while still keeping type and at the same there is no ide being used to java it make much sense to switch to scala unless an ide support that is stable and stable enough is not

best practices states for performance you should not have more than 2000 items in a you can perfectly well have millions of items in a but you should carefully define your views and use of index columns to only return less than 2000 items at one your list data change often and you have a lot of memory available on the it is worth looking at portalsitemapprovider for querying the info on the various methods to query lists and a full comparative whitepaper can be found	
best solution have already been i just want to add some simplest solution is to have a counter and increment on every new this works quite well as long as only one thread creates new if multiple processes or even systems add new things get a bit more you must coordinate the creation of new ids with locking or any similar synchronisation you could also assign id ranges to every proceses to reduce the synchronisation or extend the file id by a unique process better solution might be to use guids in this scenario and do not have to care about synchronisation between you can at some random data to every identifier to make them harder to guess if this is a coommon is storing files in a directory structure where the location of a file depends on its file might be stored as this avoids directories with a huge number of i am not really aware why this is done may be file system performance issues but it is quite i do not know if similar things are common if the files are stored directly in the

best thing to do for handling errors in your program is the because simple tasks are the least likely to services are most definitely the they add several more layers of technology and custom code that can application should at the very least write error messages with any important information about the error to a log so you can find out what next simplest step would be to send a simple indicating that the program had an with any useful email address and smtp server you need to successfully send the message should be in the configuration information for the you still want to add sending your error information to a web service after logging and fine at least you will have a log and message about any web services failures you

boils down to the fact that the compilation phase has lesser information to work with and hence the runtime needs to do more work in case of duck typed if i am making the method invocation in case of java or the invocation to bar can be optimized in the compilation process by discovering the type of and then directly invoking the method at the memory location where the compiler knows it will be since a python or any other dynamically typed language compiler does not know what type the object foo belongs it has to do a type check at runtime and then look up the address of the bar method and then invoke are other difficulties a python compiler writer struggles with as though the one above hopefully adequately gives an so even with the best compiler statically typed languages are likely to perform much better at dynamically typed languages score are typically in the development due to fewer lines of code to write and and no compile wait times for the development often goes through much

both and are equivalent apart from the possibility of calling on a instance would give you a you override the functionality of either of them independently not sure that would ever be a good idea unless trying to work around the shortcomings of another which would mean you could make them find people on both sides of the aisle as to the one to i prefer the operator rather than the talking about likely a better idea to use instead of either one of those	
both but in most minds there is a arrays store their values while functions compute their in other arrays are optimized for and functions are optimized for i think a good distinction to	
both projects have the same priority for the one obvious reason is for project managers to give higher management the illusion that both of the projects are taken care that the two projects could belong to different customers be requested by different people from higher customer wants to be told to wait while a different project is given leave the other one for a lot of not an acceptable even though this leads to delays for both believe this is related to the notion of in a software even if something takes more time to it looks faster when it appears to be doing instead of idly waiting for some other stuff to

brian above said for subversion would also let you do commit hooks that could do substitution for of this i think the problem in the svn world is that you really modify the what the svn book hook scripts can do almost there is one dimension in which hook script authors should show do not modify a commit transaction using hook while it might be tempting to use hook scripts to automatically correct errors or shortcomings or policy violations present in the files being doing so can cause subversion keeps caches of certain bits of repository and if you change a commit transaction in this those caches become indetectably this inconsistency can lead to surprising and unexpected instead of modifying the you should simply validate the transaction in the hook and reject the commit if it does not meet the desired as a your users will learn the value of work there any reason you do this during the build process with ant or

build on unlike generics are not instantiated at compile the code generated by the compiler for a generic type is completely agnostic to the specializations you use in your the compiler spits out one piece of code that works for any substitution of type parameters that meets the it until when an instance of a fully specified generic type is that the jit compiler will create code specific to your type the code that is generated works for anything that meets the criteria of the the compiler treats your member as a variable of type since that is as much as it can infer from the since the compiler has to emit generic code for the it must choose which method to call based on what it and since it be sure whether or not will be a at it must choose

by the you mean the usage of concepts like lambda functions and list then it should be evident that code that has to deal with operations on lists is almost always more concise when written in the but if mixing with imperative code in a mostly imperative it really is just a matter of python for you can reimplement the haskell qsort crackmigg posted like if list return x xs return writing the last line for y in xs if for y in xs if arguably more this is obviously more concise than the implementation is how i would have thought about implementing it before i learned functional version is extremely clear and you are acclimated to functional programming and grok what is going to do as easily as the programmer groks a loop without even having to think much about and clearly what the real issue at stake functional programming is a different if the people you work with used to thinking and the type to get excited not just a new but a whole other way of thinking about solving their then any amount of code comparisons going to win them

can be called from if the type you call it on have a good implementation the default is to return the type name rather than something meaningful about the instance of that this method is inherited from the base and you can overload it in your own types to do whatever you is a not a function you should only use this if the object you need already is a string in some or if you know there is a good implicit conversion available from this will throw an exception is the object cannot be converted when the object is is another way to write but it differs in that it returns rather than throwing an exception if the cast attempts to actually the argument into a this is the best option if you really know much about the it can be slow because it has to do a lot of extra work to determine what kind of results to but that same work also makes it the most robust option when you know very much about the if nothing else is it will fall back to calling the the string method can also be used to convert certain types to with the additional advantage that you have some control over what the resulting string will look this is a little more but includes a couple different mechanisms for converting objects into a representation that can be safely stored and from disk or other streaming that includes a binary but most often involves converting to a string in some format or other serialization is appropriate when you want to later convert the your string back into originating or if you want a complete representation of a complex

categories of uses for perfectly reasonable and downright helpful uses of for variable string of bytes you have in your generated embedded documentation see old source control history to the in practice you may have to include some ugly artifact in your code depending on some tool or some strange requirement which is helpful or needed for some but its not something you want to scroll over all the so you compromise by keeping it in your code but stashing it away so its not in your illegal uses of punishable by wtfs such and paste big chunks of heard of a malicious or code that lazy reviewers ask there are uses that depend on your such it to group members with related it to group types of class members is a but i believe that it is much more useful to group members by relationship or functionality rather than simply their grouping constructors may make sense because they all perform a similar function and may very well call each therefore it may be helpful to group them in a you could have several private methods that do all kinds of different some serving one set of some serving the just the fact that they are private methods does not imply that they are strongly related or that they should be maybe they could instead be grouped by what kinds of application specific functions they maybe some are dedicated to order submission and others are dedicated to data we naturally like to group things by but we have to remember that it is sometimes more helpful to group things by some functional relation as i this last group is largely up to and heavily depends on the type of application and also your forget there are other ways to organize your code such as partial classes or further refactoring of a class into multiple go use	
cerberus is not supported in javascript you need to get rid of that and use something to keep in mind is that there is no standard for regular expression it is different in each so testing in something that uses the regular expression engine is not a valid test of how it will work in try and look for a reference on javascript regular such as match that looks for characters is also this will ensure that there are at least 8 but it does not limit the string to since the character class with the at the end can match as many characters as what you want instead is to replace the at the end with the and eliminate it from the re the other not really sure why you would want to restrict the length of unless a hard database limit there since you be storing passwords in plain text in the but instead hashing them down to something fixed size using a secure hash algorithm with a and as i see a reason to be so restrictive on the set of characters you recommend something more like re why would you forbid l and o from your passwords it looks like trying to forbid i as which you forgot to this will make it very hard for people to construct good and since you never see a password as you type no reason to worry about letters which look confusingly if you want to have a more permissive re

clarify more of the architecture and how i ended up solving i have the following projects xml mvc vb xml assembly handles serializing the business objects dealing with only the business so i would output an xelement something like problem arises that i am using jqgrid and i need to add elements to each invoice to certain actions so i need something html such as got it to work but i had to generate all the actionhtml in the controller which is obviously not a good separation of concerns and i lost all my htmlhelper methods and so how i ended up solving it the way a webforms view use brail views for my i can use the contenttype page attribute to set it to the collection of my raw business objects as the model the model building the actonhtml element for each invoice in the view getting my htmlhelper methods and output the actual business elements i can simply invoke my vb xml library and do and i am further make this more reusable i created a jqgrid master page that has all the record counts and such in content areas so i can just pass that information in on the actual pages and just worry about outputting the element

compiler will emit and if you define a so really just save some has been an interesting this is something from my favorite book via is what i i like and i wish that they were supported in the framework and its the reason is properties look like fields but are this has been known cause a phenomenal amount when a programmer code that appears to be accessing there are many assumptions that the programmer makes that not be true for a property may be or field access is readable and if you a it is best to offer get and set accessor property method may throw an field access never an property cannot be passed as an out or ref parameter to a field property method can take a long time to field access completes a reason to use properties is perform thread which can stop the thread a property should not used if thread nization in that a method is if your class can be accessed remotely your class is derived the property method will be and a method preferred to a in classes derived marshalbyrefobject should never called multiple times in a a property method may a different value each field returns the same value the class has a only now property that the current date and each time you query this it return a different this is and microsoft wishes they could fix the class by now a method instead of a property method may cause observable side field access never in other a user of a type should be able to set properties defined by a type in order he or she chooses noticing any different behavior the property method may require additional memory or return reference to something that is actually part of the so modifying the returned object no effect on the original querying a field always returns reference to an object that guaranteed to be part of the original working with property that returns a copy can very confusing to this characteristic is frequently not

condone using a language in a manner that suited for being able to write code in a given language the same thing as being able to write code in the style of that your style match the language then a good indicator that you are making things much more difficult than need there is a certain amount of validity to maintaining ways when dealing with a mature application which is built in a backwards consistency provides maintainability and if a team works on a project and everybody injects their own style or approach then the project becomes a maintenance have to carefully balance the cost of adding a new coding style to an existing however if you are starting a new project then you have a clean slate to implement enforcing coding standards is a good but you have to be able to get a mediator to on the requirement before you can demand it of your

could add the id value to the end of the name when a record is so when someone deletes id 3 the name becomes and then when they delete id 100 the name becomes this would allow you to create a unique composite index on the name and deleted fields but you then have to filter the name column whenever you display it and remove the id from the end of the a better solution would be to replace your deleted column with a column of type you could then maintain a unique index on name and deleted with a record having a null value in the this would prevent the creation of multiple names in an active state but would allow you to delete the same name multiple obviously need to do a test when undeleting a record to ensure that there is no row with the same name and a null field before allowing the could actually implement all of this logic within the database by using an trigger for the this trigger would not delete records but would instead update the column when you deleted a following example code demonstrates table swtest id int name datetime trigger on swtest of delete update swtest set where id in from and is null required to prevent duplicates when deleting already deleted records unique index on into swtest values into swtest values from swtest where id into swtest values from swtest where id into swtest values from swtest table select from this query returns the name thingy1 thingy2 thingy2 thingy2 within your code you can delete records using a normal delete and let the trigger take care of the the only possible issue i could was that deleting already deleted records could result in duplicate hence the condition in the trigger to not update the field on an already deleted

couple of people have mentioned syntax as a hindrance to i think a particular issue that drives a large number of developers lack of algebraic precedence language where the expression 2 3 4 has the value 20 going to be a commercial the syntax is very and anybody who knows smalltalk can figure out why expressions are evaluated the way they it runs counter to what had drilled into you during your entire primary education in learning smalltalk and is trying to use it to do basically any kind of calculation at all will run into this problem repeatedly until they learn that they have to parenthesize because only a problem with some and causes incorrect rather than an error take them a long time to figure out the first n times it significant percentage of developers will never get over

curious about the not mentioned in the reference guide and in the javadoc described extension of the which provides ability to create new users and existing implementing the interface you have to implement five methods of its own and one which it inherits from the userdetailsservice which it methods userexists and the inherited method the spring security framework there are two concrete implementations of and the interface and the concrete implementations are implemented by luke seems the spring security framework never uses the concrete conclusion is that the interface is included purely as a convenience interface which the user of the framework may or may not decide to perhaps there were some thought that later on more concrete implementations would exist and take out some of the work for the framework looking for is more for the information to be of value it has to come directly or guess this is most from someone with insight into the framework development anyone else can just make like i just did just a convenience there more such interfaces and classes which appear in the reference guide as interested in knowing as it might be helpful to me during through all interfaces and classes to see which ones are actually used inside the framework is a bit tideous and it could also be error prone if reflection is involved calls are made which my ide figure what is the userdetailsmanager interface used and

depends on the type of web applications can continue running even after exceptions have bubbled up to the execution is common practice to an exception if you catch the exception at a level where it be dealt you would almost always add context to the at the very least add some logging at the higher level to say that it was caught and example calls b calls c this you would want b to add some logging so that you can differentiate between b generating and throwing an and c generating and throwing an that would allow you a greater ability to debug and fix problems general you will almost never want an exception to kill your the best practice is to catch the except and exit this allows you to save any currently open information and release resources that are being used so they become if you intend to you can create your own information report that includes the things you were doing when you caught the fatal you let the exception kill your process you are eliminating your chance to get custom tailored crash and you are also skipping the part where you provide the user with a friendly error message and then i would recommend always catching and never voluntarily letting them run amok in your you are writing a you have to choose ahead of time whether your function will throw an or be exception in those sometimes you will throw an exception and have no idea if the calling party will catch but in that catching it is not your as long as the api declares that the function could throw looking for a word that means possibly throw anyone know what it going to bug me all

developing and loading oracle xml gateway message there are several methods you can employ to track they are all manual and require setting a standard within a development from version tracking tools like svn each time you change a message you can change the map name in the properties then each time you load the you will be able to choose which version you want to from the trading partner setup in the xml if your question is how to compare two existing map files to find the differences between the most effective way is to start two sessions of message tile them and move through them side by identifying which elements are mapped to which is relatively straightforward you are comparing slight variations of the same source and target definitions and you can focus particularly on elements or levels that have a blue circle icon in the element mapping tab where the logic used becomes true that the map files themselves are in but it is of little use to compare the xml one to the other using a comparison really no substitute in this instance for human using the message designer tool to compare exposes the logic and the and post process procedures as well as the elements this if i have misunderstood the question please feel free to elaborate and be happy to answer xml gateway

development i mean on a small boat rocking up and down and someone is holding a gun to your i are the tools at your disposal making the problem is typically a cycle of observe the in some environments this is a very quick and painless but in others very we end up using little tricks to help us observe the result and run the code was thinking of this because i just started using ssis tool included with sql server been quite challenging for me to make mainly because no guidance on what all the dialogs mean and also because the errors are very cryptic and most of the time really tell you what the problem think the easiest environment had to work in was vb6 because there you can edit code while the application is running and it will continue running with your new you even have to run it this can save you a lot of in netbeans with java you can do the it steps out of the method and the method with the new sql server 2000 when there is an error in a trigger you get no stack which can make it really tricky to locate where the problem occurred since an insert can have a cascading effect and trigger many in oracle you get a very nice little stack trace with line numbers so resolving the problem is very of the things that i see really help in locating error messages when things go a stack trace when a problem environment where you can then output the value of variables and step to follow the execution graphical debug environment that shows the code as screen that can show the current values of variables so you can print to to turn on debug logging on a production is the worst seen and what can be done to get around these really intend for this to be flame really just looking for ideas to improve systems so that if creating something think about these things and not contribute to also looking for creative ways around these limitations that i can use if i find myself in this is the most challenging development environment ever had to work in and what did you do to get around the	
dictionaries of dictionaries are useful for other than performance they allow you to store context information about the data without having extra fields on the objects and make querying subsets of the data terms of memory it would stand to reason that one large dictionary will use less ram than multiple smaller if nesting each additional layer of nesting will roughly double the number of dictionaries you need to terms of query multiple dicts will take longer due to the increased number of lookups i think the only way to answer this question is for you to profile your own my suggestion is to use the method that makes your code the cleanest and easiest to of all the features of dictionaries are probably the most heavily tweaked for optimal

do not think cyclic dependencies like the ones you describe to be as long as the concepts that are interdependent are at the same level of abstraction and relate to the same parts of the it may not be necessary to hide these from each neurons and connections fit this bill in my common to reduce such couplings is to extract and possibly even put these in a separate simply organizing by packages inside a single project does not allow you to hide implementation details a common pattern that allows you to really hide implementations is as code interfaces this you hide the module from the client which means the code in the module even see the implementation nesting of packages serves several some projects may have a domain model which is organized in in this case the packages reflect some grouping of the and references may go when it comes to things like implementation of your suggested pattern is quite common and a good thing to the deeper in the package hierarchy you get the more specific the class is believed to

do this for any object in javascript will not be simple or you will run into the problem of erroneously picking up attributes from the prototype that should be left in the prototype and not copied to the new for you are adding a method to as some answers you will need to explicitly skip that but what if there are other additional methods added to or other intermediate that you know in that you will copy attributes you so you need to detect attributes with the addition to encounter a tougher problem when you try to copy objects that have hidden for is a hidden property of a an prototype is referenced with the attribute which is also and will not be copied by a loop iterating over the source i think might be specific to javascript interpreter and it may be something different in other but you get the not everything is you can copy a hidden attribute if you know its but i know of any way to discover it another snag in the quest for an elegant solution is the problem of setting up the prototype inheritance if your source prototype is then simply creating a new general object with will but if the prototype is some descendant of then you are going to be missing the additional members from that prototype which you skipped using the or which were in the but enumerable in the first one solution might be to call the source property to get the initial copy object and then copy over the but then you still will not get for a object stores its data as a hidden if obj typeof return var copy for attr in if return d1 new wait for 5 start start d2 date string for d1 will be 5 seconds behind that of a way to make one date the same as another is by calling the but that is specific to the date i think there is a general solution to this though i would be happy to be i had to implement general deep copying i ended up compromising by assuming that i would only need to copy a plain or the last 3 types are so i could perform a shallow copy and not worry about it i further assumed that any elements contained in object or array would also be one of the 6 simple types in that this can be accomplished with code like the handle the 3 simple and null or if obj typeof return handle if instanceof var copy new return handle if instanceof var copy for i len i return handle if instanceof var copy for attr in if return throw new to copy its type above function will work adequately for the 6 simple types i as long as the data in the objects and arrays form a tree that there more than one reference to the same data in the for this would be tree 3 this would but you would get 2 copies of the inner node instead of 2 references to the same directedacylicgraph 3 cloning this would cause a stack overflow due to infinite cylicgraph 3 will not be able to handle any javascript but it may be sufficient for many purposes as long as you assume that it will just work for anything you throw at

dotnetopenauth 3 in mvc and implementing a rememberme facility finding that even if i set createpersistentcookie to true in and the user is not remembered the session times i inspect the cookie i find it is marked as persistent and does have an expiry date way in the i assume because i set my forms timeout to a few years if the user closes the browser and it they are remembered correctly as long as the asp session timed older of scott makes me wonder if it is because formsauthentication tries to renew the authentication ticket and maybe in an openid model that work but i have set forms in and anyway i thought that forcing a persistent cookie would make that stuff also wondering why the dotnetopenid mvc sample include a rememberme checkbox maybe something tricky about the other here at stackoverflow i see i am automatically remembered across wondering whether they used something other than dotnetopenid to do their openid else done rememberme successfully with dotnetopenid in any for trying to turns out this was not about after reading that my hosting provider is probably recycling the app pool regularly and causing the authentication ticket encryption to be done with a new machine per the preceding linked article i added the following under in my and it resolved the a new key to place a new key to place with dotnetopenid in

expanded on the answer to answer some of the compiler takes the inner classes and turns them into since private methods are only available to the inner class the compiler has to add new methods that have package level access so that the classes have access to like this ones are added by the a private void final b b new call changed by the method generated by the compiler visible by classes in the same void private void final a a new call changed by the method generated by the compiler visible by classes in the same void classes are the but they have the addition of a reference to the outer class so that the methods can be called on reason java does it this way is that they did not want to require vm changes to support inner so all of the changes had to be at the compiler compiler takes the inner class and turns it into a top level class at the vm level there is no such thing as an inner the compiler then also has to generate the new they are made at the package level to ensure that only classes in the same package can access the compiler also updated the method calls to the private methods to the generated can avoid having the compiler generate the method my declaring the methods as absence of and the downside to that is that any class in the package can call the

expressions are definitely the first place most start out they really cope with many edge cases that one meets in most languages text that looks like keywords can be in found string string literals in turn can contain escaped as well as special same thing goes for to do a good job of syntax highlighting you need to perform lexing of the source parsing it with the application of heuristics to build a list of where each region of the source is annotated with how it is to be edits take you can again apply language rules to see how far this change can alter the presentation of a for example typing a letter inside a string literal simply makes the string literal region but typing a closing quote truncates the region and turns the leftover part of it into subject to all the other lexing

fairly large ruby we have a situation where a given object is identified by a couple of name and each of these value types serves a somewhat different purpose and so are not exactly equivalent and name persist in different so we with a variety of values being passed around the application names and this situation seems like a problem to at least some degree since already been bitten by bugs which involved not being clear what type should be passed to a given i actually recall seeing similar problem code in a number of applications over the though i again never gave a specific name to as a typeless does not allow classical polymorphic functions in the way that as a work a colleague has often resorted code of this def initialize if elsif raise proliferation of this code around our just results in what i would call it often works but sometimes creates very puzzling have three questions about there a formal name for this as or something bad to do people think this there a systematic way to the challenge that we have refactoring that many tests created use this and thus we would have to change tests and the and so have the scaffold effect of ordinary i am think that one could actually this loose the code into a function rather than immediate rip it but would be a good

far as i can you are looking for the storage part of a data warehouse system here reports would be the the way commercial systems are doing is the cache you preaggregate your tables and create caches of the only way to accelerate your queries is to make the database system do less for this means less which in turn means less time spent in iterating the data or less data in the i would either propose the cache there really more than 24 you should be able to trivially parallelize the sorting queue by creating copies of the way to do would be to cache at hour granularity and then aggregate the hours into days 30 minutes if your timezones require this means you cache at a finer granularity than your daily cache but at a coarser granularity than the original

far as i you have two choices for floating point exception handling in c and if you floating point exceptions most environments do by you can see whether any floating point exceptions have occurred by calling fetestexcept available in visual but you can steal the mingw implementation easily in the public once an exception has been not cleared until you call so you can call fetestexcept at the end of a series of calculations to see if any of them raised an this give you the traps that you asked but it does let you test if problems like nan or have occurred and react as you can floating point exceptions by calling in linux or in how the operating system handles a floating point exception depends on your operating the os sends a sigfpe so you can install a signal handler to catch that and set a flag that tells your routine to react the os invokes structured exception handling to convert the processor exception into a language exception that you can catch using a block in c or block in for mac os as described in you should be able to exceptions using from and as long as you use the default compiler options disable you should be able to catch exceptions using written a bit more on this and other floating point issues in c and in blog if

feel fortunate that i have been given an opportunity to improve code practices in my office by starting to implement some internal code reviews which could start out as some simple i need suggestions on tools and general went to school for softe and understand the process of classic software i then worked at a big company making operating systems where we spared no cost reviewing code and looking for i was on a very good team and used diff and participated in the mindset of scrutinizing code as a i work in a nearly opposite office that makes web pages and no one reviews we even have cvs setup it was one blue moon ago before i got we recently got hacked and defaced on one of our minor servers due to some insecure code that allowed unrestricted file because of my experience charged with coming up with the new review process which the boss likes because we can still bill for that time and he now sees that we need to do so i want to lose this opportunity because as much as i like the lack of structure we really could benefit from main question is what kind of tool would be good for putting up an internal review checklist for we could build our own but reusing a tool is obviously someone suggested i looked at it my main problem is web sites are not or even they could have problems in the even the js can reveal security and these things are all interconnected like a hard to break up and i see one monolithic security checklist cutting i have been breaking it up based on each piece that interacts with another and coming up with the short list for that such as when going from php into a remember to validate and escape from php to list sensitive details in hidden fields or functions on the client that kind of have to ultimately build something that integrates all the aspects of web for now focusing on security in the form of code i have to break it up by conceptual task because everyone will use it and some of us some just barely do some others are and we each have different things that need to be especially between sysadmins and php code review tool for web both for security and

few more will be added to this list but i will have the complete restricted i do not have the complete list of allowed characters would be too long even i try to get it and would include all chars like certain foreign will eventually have the list of disallowed characters and probably not the list of allowed must have either the list of all allowed characters or the list of all disallowed else you cannot tell if the input is further if you have one of the you have the second implicitly if the character set is then just implement the shorter but if you use there will probably be much more characters you want to disallow than to allow think of all the fancy chinees and japanes so i think you should really build a list of allowed characters and use ranges like where you really want to build the list of disallowed you will have to build a regular expression like do not forget to escape the characters if required and use ranges if so many chars in the not allowed list like does not seem to are spaces in your are they in your i am not but may be this might be a

find it helpful to launch the offline msdn library separately rather than have it appear within visual this makes it easier to browse at a decent size without interfering with your actual coding window and often look up documentation without having visual studio open at usually use the index pane on the left then if i need to know about in a particular namespace or i can just start typing the of that only works if you know which namespace to look so i would thoroughly recommend taking half an hour to just browse the most important namespaces to get a feeling for in have an idea of web windows need to really learn anything there by rote just try to get the gist of so you know where to look also find that when searching the including helps a of course plenty of great content but nice to be able to filter it

first version of fieldstorage contains a the size of the fieldstorage class includes enough bytes to hold a when you construct a the vector is constructed right before the body of constructor is when a fieldstorage is so is the does not necessarily allocate the vector on the if you a fieldstorage then the space for the vector comes from that heap not the if you define a global fieldstorage then the space for the vector comes from neither the stack nor the but rather from space designated for global objects the or section on some that the vector performs heap allocations to hold the actual so it is likely to only contain a few or a pointer and couple of but it may contain whatever your stl implementation needs it second version of fieldstorage contains a pointer to a the size of the fieldstorage class includes room for a pointer to a not an actual you are allocating storage for the vector using new in the body of and you leaking that storage when fieldstorage is because you define a destructor that deletes the

form controller as or uses commands to pass data between the html form and my question is it common practice to use the backing model as the command or is it common to create a separate command with correspond attributes to those in the backing issue is that to use the backing model as the property editors are necessary for conversion of imagine a data model with many strongly typed custom field on a form property editor does the conversion before the validator is if the type conversion is not possible input then the validator never gets a chance to provide a detailed error all displayed on the html form is a generic error see my stackoverflow alternative is to create a separate command that duplicates each field in the backing but as a in this way the validator can validate the string representation of each the is then responsible for converting the command to the backing from my research of spring this appears to be intended my hesitation to go down this path is the cumbersome manner in which a separate command needs to be created for each data then the added work having to marshal between the command and the data so much more convenient to have the form directly edit the backing model and use property editors to do the the problem then is curious how others approach the issue of editing of models that contain custom typed of spring form

found submodules to be particularly useful on the projects worked once set them working on the whole project requires adding additional parameters to almost every command and the syntax completely i imagine if i worked on larger projects with more see it as a more beneficial are two possibilities that keep the as independent git repos that you pull from into your main bring your external projects into separate in your main repo that includes your core this makes it easy to update the main project from the external but complicated to send changes back to the external i think of this as a good way to include project but it work so well with shared simple explanation up each as a remote in your main repo and merge from each of them into your branch that also contains your core this requires some if you make any changes to the external projects in your main they must be made in the branch and then merged into the and you never want to merge into the project this makes it easy to send changes back to the external projects and is a perfectly acceptable use of branches in shared scripts can be handled as another independent branch in your main directory which your external partners can pull from and push to as a remote you try to run svn git in the same you make it very hard to use branching in either because svn does branching by copying file directories while git tracks neither system would automatically see branches you make in the i think that is more trouble than it is

found to the question on jguru written by terence who created i copied this explanation from the site linked syntax directed translations can be done with actions within the these kinds of translations can only spit out constructs that are functions of information already seen at that point in the tree parsers allow you to walk an intermediate form and manipulate that gradually morphing it over several translation phases to a final form that can be easily printed back out as the new a simple translation problem where you want to print out an html page whose title is are n where n is the number of identifiers you found in the input the ids must be printed after the title like are 3 with simple actions in your grammar how can you compute the you without reading the whole so now we know we need an intermediate the best is usually an ast found since it records the input in this just a list but it demonstrates my now you know that a tree is a good thing for anything but simple given an how do you get output from imagine simple expression one way is to make the nodes in the tree specific classes like integernode and so then you just ask each node to print itself for you would have plusnode extends commonast public string ast left ast right return left intnode extends commonast public string return an expression you can translate it back to text with wrong with seems to work it appears to work well in this case because but i argue even for this simple tree grammars are more readable and are formalized descriptions of precisely what you coded in the returns string that the specific class approach actually encodes a complete parser for int by hand in as parser generator this should make you main weakness of the heterogeneous ast approach is that it cannot conveniently access context in a your context is easily accessed because it can be passed in as a you also know precisely which rule can invoke which other rule is this expression a while condition or an if by looking at the the plusnode class above exists in a isolated world where it has no idea who will invoke the programmer cannot tell in which context it will be invoked by reading adding actions to your input parser works for very straightforward translations order of output constructs is the same as the input constructs can be generated from information parsed up to the point when you need to spit them out you will need an intermediate ast is the best form using a grammar to describe the structure of the ast is analogous to using a grammar to parse your input formalized descriptions in a language like antlr are better than hand coded actions within a tree grammar have very clear context and can conveniently access information passed from invoking translations that manipulate the tree for multipass translations are also much easier using a tree

frequent uploads of small the fastest way would be to implement your own proprietary but that would require a considerable amount of work and also it would be meaning future integration would be difficult unless you are able to implement your protocol in any client if you choose to do it this is my suggestion for a simple 1 byte to identify be for upload 0x02 for download 0x11 for upload 0x12 for download can be or prefixed with a byte for the length the name is less than 255 md5 for instance upload request or download size upload request or download upload request or download could be implemented on top of a simple tcp you can also use avoiding the cost of establishing a connection but in this case you have to deal with retransmission deciding to implement your own take a look at http libraries like you could make your server use standard http commands like get for download and post for this would save a lot of work and be able to test the download with any web suggestion to improve performance is to use as the file repository not the but something like you can create a single table containing one char column for the file name and one blob column for the file since sqlite is lightweight and does an efficient most of the time avoid the disk access assuming you need client although is your preference to give you raw native code rarely this is the major bottleneck in this kind of most probably will be disk access and network mentioning this because in java probably be able to make a servlet to do exactly the same thing http get for download and post for with less than 100 lines of use derby instead of sqlite in this put that servlet in any container and

from data access a major factor in code is data less data means more of it fits into the is mainly a factor with data wisdom says data structures must be aligned at word boundaries because the cpu can only access entire and if a word contains more than one you have to do extra work instead of a simple but caches can completely invalidate this a java boolean array uses an entire byte for each value in order to allow operating on individual values you can reduce the data size by a factor of 8 if you use actual but then access to individual values becomes much more requiring bit shift and mask operations class does this for due to cache this can still be considerably faster than using a when the array is iirc i once achieved a speedup by a factor of 2 or 3 this

functions almost never return a instead they return a or use special values to indicate error returns they store the error code in a which you can read with instructs the marshaler to read this variable after the native function and stash the error code where you can later read it with the idea is that the runtime may call other win32 functions behind the scenes which mess up the error code from your call before you get a chance to inspect which return a belong to a different level of abstraction than win32 generally these functions are or from so they use the win32 code might call win32 functions instructs the marshaler to check the return and if not a success to create and throw an exception containing the the managed declaration of your function then has as its return the or vb compiler cannot check the unmanaged so it has to trust whatever you tell if you put on a function which returns something other than a you will get strange results random if you put on a function which does not set the last win32 error you will get garbage instead of a useful error

generally best practice to use named constants in place of magic but it sure is tedious and error prone keeping a database reference table and a file of named constants in is there some easy way to keep these two sources for this info in or am i overlooking an obvious design case my question an i have a reference table with 2 this table associates a usersstatusid 1 with the userstatus the user table relies on this table to normalize when querying for a status from i have two userstatusid from users where userstatus userstatusid from users where userstatus practice is to use the latter so the meaning of the number 1 is but this means i have to maintain a complete list of valid in my userstatus table and in my how do i avoid having to keep both the db reference table and my constants file using a centralized constants file so only 1 place i have to update for my but is there a way to avoid having to update a constants file at all when a new status in have one schedule a script to run once a day to populate a constants file via a query of the reference tables in the is this the best practice for keeping named constants in code and database reference tables in	
generally considered to only catch the errors you are interested in the case of probably recent call no such file or you want to silently ignore that you would say you accidently pass the function an integer instead of a will give the error coercing to need string or int you probably want to ignore which can be difficult to you want to ignore all catch rather than a bare catches include the exception which for to the which correctly except you want to write ever better behaved the exception can represent various but in the example above we only want to ignore so we could be even more if suppress such file or reraise the as an unexpected could also and change the to

getting into specifics about particular i can give you some of the benefits to using a typical message queuing are typically good infrastructure for simulating the think of a big event system where you are not limited to one or even one you put information into these such that the data can be picked up by any application who is listening for message queuing systems allow for persistent think of a typical event if the listener is disconnected or otherwise unresponsive at the time of the then the event is with a persistent message the message will remain in queue until the listener is no are lost in this know about the products you but i know with jms you can have fine grained control over threading as messages are popped from the in you could have a thread per performing actions in that on the messages as they are pulled you have the ability to pull messages from multiple queues and perform actions on all within a shared

going to answer part of this question and it yes this can be you have two options on approaching the region can try to fit your window management into the region you would essentially have to write a region adapter for the docking library you would like to infragistics actually provides a cal region adapter for their docking library that you could take a look at different way of doing it is to create a service that provides an interface for modules to use to show register the service it with your unity container and every module can call this is a more flexible way to go since regions out of the box have a concept of it is true that this means that you will be skipping out on the region but it is a trade off of flexibility vs regards to the your shell window will just contain a ribbon control which either all modules have access to or you wrap a service around it so that all modules interact with it through your own interface this

going to invent your own source control perhaps your own operating browser etc means if i ask you to write a small application which take about a be able to come back in about 10 years with an application run on any other machine operating be maintained by anyone else language that using a different source control system and different probably buggy are hard to for perform well you optimise than the well not have a good change log control is also hard to write well how confident are you that you can do a better job than the large teams of people thought about this long and and have proved their systems over you because the company will have gone bust long before you produce are times when worth reinventing some it sounds like you want to reinvent every wheel you ever come use the fact that millions of developer hours have gone into creating decent source control content management plugin scripting languages do you really think going to do a better job than those people save enough time by reinventing the wheel that end up coming out with a product faster than by reusing existing if just for fun a different matter but the fact that talking about a team that talking about a commercial anyone designing their own source control system part of the task of building a different is unlikely to be able to make a persuasive case for doing so with the possible exception of

good generic solution is to use heap size this involves minimal effort and is between any type of object object by instantiating and destroying your objects many times and garbage collecting in and then taking the you avoid compiler and jvm optimizations that alter results and get a fairly accurate if you need an exact answer down to the byte then this may not be the solution for but for all practical applications that i know of memory requirement it works extremely the code below will do just public class sizeof public static void throws exception all that we are going to array to keep strong references to allocated final int count 10000 or so is enough for small objects new long heap1 allocate discard the first for i i object instantiate your data here and assign it to your code if else object discard the heap1 take a heap long heap2 take an heap final int size heap1 size size a helper method for creating strings of desired and avoiding getting tricked by string public static string int final result new for i i return new this is our way of requesting garbage collection to be aggressive it is depends on the jvm to a large it is almost always better than a single private static void throws exception for whatever reason it helps to call using several method for r r private static void throws exception long usedmem1 usedmem2 for i usedmem2 usedmem1 private static long return private static final runtime end of

good next step might be to go the iphone developer route as you most likely have the experience dealing with client curiosities limited the touch also benefits from having a fairly powerful webkit based browser which can run most ajax you can write and can interface with a server side keep things you could run a java stack on an ec2 server or some other vps that can act as the server side portion of your a investment for the developer license and a month for a cheap vps for but the payoff can be high if the wind is blowing in the right direction and a full moon when you launch your and cheap addictive games can bring in a decent amount of money from the long though who knows how long this will hold with serious games being launched on the iphone by major players like

hacky little algorithm that works great for large numbers uses the relation how to do it in base 10 you can trivially convert to any other logarithm the number of decimal digits in the the integral part of your is since 123456 has 6 can stop here if all you need is the integer part of the just subtract 1 from the result of step get the fractional part of the divide the number by of then compute the log of that using use a simple series approximation if nothing else is and add it to the integer to get the fractional part of compute and add it to the result of step which is note that basically just tacking on a decimal point to the front of the large there is probably a nice way to optimize this in your use and for really big numbers you even need to bother with grabbing all of the digits is a great approximation to

had a similar problem when registering a callback delegate would be then my problem was that the object with the method being delegated was getting i created the object in a more global place so as to keep it from being something like that here are some other things to look additional take a look at from the marshal that is another way you could do just make sure that the delegates are not instead of delegates in your declare them as may not solve the but take a look at even though that may not work for you since you are dealing with a longer lifetime than for what that is typically look at for creating these methods will require the use of and might therefore put some other constraints on your

hard to judge the joel quote without any prior give my opinion from a sustainable software development point of view which things is good and you should do it whenever you feel like things have spun out of things get out of you often write the same bit of code better the second time around because you have learnt from your previous you and start afresh and decide to continue you may just be adding to the often developers write code and get too far into their first attempt that they think they can code their way out of if you are in that rollback and start again and be much easier to write the code you want and not have it turn out looking like a plate full of into the habit of out code forget about code quality and just spend a amount of time to code a simple version and then start again and find that be easier second time around when you do it with quality and testing in sure what just said within the context of the quote as it probably refers to systems many years old and not to the entire code base from scratch

have a program running as root on talking to a tty an lcd implemented as a the device for what worth is like to have my program that writes to this device be able to have exclusive access to the so as to not have any interference from other instances of the program running at the same see that a ioctl option called tiocexcl which will prevent additonal of the device to wit calls to the same file will succeed unless the tiocexcl ioctl is this will prevent additional opens except by i tested this and it works just as if a user tries to open i changed the then the open fails with something like and if a root user tries to open it i ideally want is a way to this exclusive access to the tty to work for root so have multiple root users using the program that writes to the but somehow their access to the lcd would be apparently the tiocexcl ioctl option will not work for me since it stop root users from opening an tty guess there are a number of options but i am reaching out to all to see if you might have other thoughts or missing something about using some other way via or or to get exclusive there was some way i could detect that some other process has the device i could just wait and i know about lsof but loath to invoke it from inside this program just to learn and there are race conditions with i can get over could implement locking like apparently used to be done to get exclusive access to tty the only program writing to the lcd device is i am inclined to do something like the following to lock inside the do any do any sleep a tad to not flash messages too fast on exclusive access to a tty device from a root program on

have been following the discussion on the on ext4 that causes files to be zeroed in crash if one uses the temp write temp rename temp to target posix says that unless is you cannot be sure the data has been flushed to get the file contents it or make it open original file and truncate write new close not good even with as the computer can crash during or and you end up with partially written it has been thought that this is pretty get the file contents it or make it open temp write contents to temp close temp rename temp file to original it to make it safe on ext4 you would need to get the file contents it or make it open temp write contents to temp close temp rename temp file to original would be safe and on crash you should either have the new file contents or never zeroed contents or partial but if the application uses lots of after every write would be my question how to modify multiple files efficiently on a system where is required to be sure that changes have been saved to and i really mean modifying many as in thousands of modifying two files and doing after each be too but does slow things down when modifying multiple changed the close temp file to corrent added emphasis on writing many many many and efficient way to modify multiple files on posix

help on defining display and currency ensure that an application behaves the same in whichever country it is datawindow expressions and the masks used in display formats and edit masks require notation for that when you specify a number in a datawindow expression or in a number a comma always represents the thousands delimiter and a period always represents the decimal you should also always use the sign to represent the symbol for the locally correct symbols are displayed for numbers and the comma and period are replaced by the delimiters defined in the number settings in the regional or international settings property sheet in the windows control the sign in the mask is replaced by the local currency symbol as defined in the currency setting in the windows control for in countries where a comma represents the decimal place and a period represents users see numbers in those is probably not the answer you were hoping to what i can suggest is use a computed field that will format the number any way you and display it as a input use the currency the user will probably feel more comfortable working with the default system locale

hit the nail on the head you want your as modeled using a state to be decoupled from your domain your domain entities probably have direct knowledge that they are being used in a state which will manage the job of transitioning them from state to state based upon certain but they understanding the business meaning of each state they are and be able to enforce or apply business rules related to those your domain entities that are appropriate for being managed by a state machine will have some kind of status that acts as a state for the state and will raise events which can be used by the state machine to determine when a transition is if it is indeed true that your states are sequential they always go or backwards and forwards exactly one not sure a state machine does make sense because there is no special context needed to choose the next state you can only go backwards or so any ordered list of states as an coupled with logic should suffice but real world processes are rarely that strictly even though they may appear to be at first

huge problem that caused us a lot of grief was using modules classes in our main web this was before we really knew what we were doing and has since been big problem with using modules is that by default any module level variables are visible to every instance of the asp worker we pass in multiple datasets and manipulate them then return them to the because we were using modules the variables holding these datasets were getting corrupted by multiple calls occuring at one was not caught in testing and was difficult to reproduce until we figured out how to properly load test our web it took something like requests per second before we could reproduce it the we just changed all the modules to and then used those classes instead of calls to the this cleared up this concurrency issue as each instantiated class had its own copy of the dataset in

i always do with table design is look at it and work out what sort of trouble i can get into what inconsistencies can be your particular the obvious one is that you could create an address in the state of wyoming and in the city of which is in the state of i mean texas you could have an address that is in the country of australia the state of texas the the city of in peru in south i want to have to explain your schema to the postman when he tracks you do you resolve you should probably only reference the city from the then the state from the then the country from the addresses are a tricky beast and the form they take depends a great deal on where they are some have some cities cross state boundaries and so you have a dire need for finding people in specific just incorporate that into a address places have postcodes of some sort which is a better choice for you may well want to select by state or in which case leave those as separate first attempt would have would have to distinguish between states in different countries washington and western australia both being but you could easily show the country in data entry screens so that the operator knows which state entering more choose the country first and the choices of state will be whittled xolotllotl is not a real city as far as i just one i made up that sounds like those beautiful incan names of

i have been playing a game on my iphone called some of you may know this game as when the game starts you get a matrix of letters like x i m l w b s t goal of the game is to find as many words as you can that can be formed by chaining letters you can start with any and all the letters that surround it are fair and then once you move on to the next all the letters that surround that letter are fair for any previously used so in the grid for i could come up with the words words must be at least 3 and no more than nxn which would be 16 in this game but can vary in some while this game is fun and i am apparently not very good at it and i wanted to cheat a little bit by making a program that would give me the best possible words longer the word the more points you not very good with algorithms or their efficiencies and so my first attempt uses a dictionary as this and does a linear search trying to match combinations with dictionary this takes a long time to find the possible and since you only get 2 minutes per it is simply not am interested to see if any stackoverflowers can come up with more efficient i am mostly looking for solutions using the big 3 and although anything with java or is cool since speed is php am adding a bounty to this question as my way of saying thanks to all the people who pitched in with their unfortunately i can only give the accepted answer to one of so measure who has the fastest boggle solver 7 days from now and award the winner the thanks to everyone that to find list of possible words from a letter matrix

i have this word document that has a whole bunch of tables some of which are pretty it spans many many pages in some i need to programmatically convert this thing to was initially told we could just copy paste into excel and save it as a then i could convert from there which would be pretty due to the formatting of some of the fields there would need to be a lot of extra manipulation on the spreadsheet after copying to excel to get it to look right and to have the csv come out should note that this is an for an old app written in frowny debating just writing a separate command line tool in if make it seems like has some word interop stuff that i doubt was in the but i investigated that too just looking for the way this can be it matter so much how achieved as long as it is achieved and done some of the steps could be done manually if they too like if getting it to some other format first would save a bunch of coding and too difficult that would be anyone done anything like this any so here is an example of exactly what need to have a word doc that looks something like birds name data type required length total digits fraction digits text yes 16 unique observation primary the table with name and vendor and birds in this as an example it just has one valid can have multiple things separated by commas where each thing would be enclosed by value tags inside the what i basically need to do is get that to convert to this observation primary will always be a base table and a stage table where base table is the same name as whatever follows the colon at the beginning of the so it would be and the stage table is always then what follows the also notice the version and the last modified and version date in the these things can be worried about later and perhaps manually is the best way to programatically convert a word document with a table structure to

i know but i still am pretty much a rest and form helpers are completely different i understand state transfer is only loosely related to the actual rendering of forms and really has to do with and to a certain extend the idea is that instead of trying to think about an entire conversation with a you write a webapp to respond in predictable ways to individual client if a client gets a you just retrieve format it for send it to and forget about a client posts an update of some you change the webapps state to reflect send back any and then forget about any future get or post will look at the new but not the message that created whether or not an application is restful depends not really on how complicated the model but on how users interact with an app meant to be at least somewhat that is is a good candidate for something that relies heavily on and interacting with a specific and is might not be such a good the other you have rails form these are great for but sometimes can be frustrating when you try to use them in more complicated what is your main do you have a specific question about rails form about rails or something specific to

i propose a somewhat unorthodox would you think about placing the column after the rather than at the very this avoid the requirement for only a portion of the table to not exactly what asking but perhaps it is a sufficient given that the alternative would be pretty the and columns outside of the for would create alignment problems when not all rows are of equal you could correct this with javascript but then be entering a whole new world of from a ui it may be that and are the most important in which case it would make sense to put them followed by a sort of of the of we seem to have an intuition that a should come after its constituent but i think it would cause too much confusion to the user if the order were reversed like this this is a question for based on your product and your something to are some more unorthodox now that i think i understand your intentions a bit the give the most recent and the link to older which are provided 10 at a time give and some other meaningful as mean and then link for each name that results corresponding to you could then also link showing all results for score so that comparisons between different users be the point is that have to give 1 dimension for each rather an unwieldy 2d data the rows sortable with jquery so that if i want mary to i can drag one after the so i to keep scrolling left to see which scores which a row when it is by changing the or again so i need to keep scrolling left and you get the perhaps it is better to look for a ui solution than a contorted markup ultimately i would be questioning how important it is to present so much data to the user at that a portion of it needs to scroll in a particular fashion for the data to be perhaps building a spreadsheet and you really do need to display a 100x100 matrix in a single if you could surely come up with more creative ways than i have to split up the

i really like python is but come close to smalltalk in my but i am a biased some answers about which i guess runs on a squeak app runs in several different smalltalks squeak the term is not really used in smalltalk from what heard it would permit good compartmentalization of users as each would have their own little private vm independent of all the systems other users which sounds wonderful from a scaling and redundancy each user has its own wasession and all ui components the user sees are instances living on the server side in that so sharing of state between sessions is something you must do typically through a not done any smalltalk since uni 15 years back and i never dug too deep into it i see much entry level help for seaside or that many projects using is easy to get going with and there is a whole free online book on i suspect setting a server up to run it is hard for the same reason not because inherently hard but just cause there will be less help online and a presumption you are already rather au fait with not in quite tons of help seaside irc on is seaside as good as i think in terms of insulating users from each would say might i be better security sticking to the languages most familiar with so i make any n00b mistakes or will seaside be worth worth scaling the learning curve and prove more comprehensible and maintainable in the long killer argument in favor of seaside imho is the true component it really makes it wonderful for complex uis and if you are afraid of learning then you even consider it in the first place i then i would warn but if you are not afraid then you will probably love squeak is a truly awesome development environment debugging live seaside changing code in the debugger and resuming etc it	
i recommend not to use php but a better python for you code more stable and with less maintenance currently using the and am very happy with if you want to stay with it depends on how flexible you want to how much the framework shall do for i ran into a bundle of problems using which is a fast and leightweight framework that not much for you but only the there is a fork named which is besser concerning the but poorly ist very powerful but complicated what what is more an than a is also powerful and totally derived from ruby on and i never had a where i used all the it has a really nice all i i liked cakephp it seems like a between complexity and an serious support like modeling and

i remember and been a few years so i may be that action is only included if you are using a hybrid installscript msi project so it would be used to run installscript actions before file copy adding a condition to it going to cause a problem if you have any installscript actions in although it leads to the question of why you want the condition in the first are probably better of using the basic msi project type which will just include the standard msi it means you have the dependency on the isscript installshield run time as well so just generally a better practice and entirely removes the worry behind your

i rewrote this after i realized i misunderstood your could code up a php script that translates all the style blocks into styles for each the pseudo code could load up an xml parser for the html email generated by your mailing list xpath get all for each parse for the id class of the css style need some regexes for for each id class look up that node by attribute id or class and append to the existing value of the style	
i say on ubuntu sometimes there remains a process eating of making the machine practically there a better way to restart i thought about writing a killall this would be a evil the script is just a quick googled and found that is a wrapper script which starts and makes sure it gets restarted if it should so there should be a better way to restart the googled that this is a common problem in this ubuntu is debian ubuntu doing it wrong at this the script looks quite sophisticated and it deals with but my skills are not good enough to understand it but this would be the best place to this is a paste of the version on my machine is found many hints but i would like this resolved to a certain degree of reliability for production seems to be exactly this unsolved it is this bug from the mysql seems related or people talk of a race condition with 2 instances of others suggest commentiong out the sanity check in the startup script to restart mysql on ubuntu	
i see eclipse lose the reference to the third party jars contained in the a get the the build path error stating the jar cannot be easy enough to fix as you can remove the save the properties of the project and then go in and the jar that it could not eclipse can then see the path to the jar and you can then compile problem is that if you have a lot of projects in your build you would have to do this task a there anything you can do to force eclipse to recognise that it actually has the jar on its to fix eclipse losing reference to third party jar in project

i see this topic when i posted from good features the rest of the folks mentioned here about dynamic i think everybody forget the most basic the pretty hard to do in compiled take for example to make it work you have to make all kind of mambo jumbo and it usualy ends with code that runs around 100 times dynamic languages have a way to do metaprogramming and that is something that keeps me there ability to create any kind of code in memory and perfectly integrate it into my instance to create calculator in all i have to do try to do that in

i should start this off by saying not sure this is necessarily the right way to deal with this i have created a window in wpf for displaying notifications in my application bit like outlook new mail i would like to try and show this window in own thread might do some work in the created the window using wpf because a bit nicer at handling things like alwaysontop and fading in and application that shows the notification is a windows forms seen examples similar to this winforms startup form not for showing a form in a different thread however unable to start a new message loop with the wpf tried just calling in a new thread however the window never it possible to show this wpf in own do i see some resources say that you should not show any ui in a separate a wpf window in another thread from a windows forms

i tend to be in the restful programming is being identified by a persistent uris are the ubiquitous choice of identifier these being manipulated using a common set of http methods are the commonly seen case the venerable becomes and actual representation retrieved for a resource is dependent on the request and not the use http accept headers to control whether you want or even a java object representing the the state in the object and representing the state in the the relationships between resources in the representation of the the links between objects are embedded directly in the representations describe how the representation can be used and under what circumstances it should be in a consistent usage of http last one is probably the most important in terms of consequences and overall effectiveness of most of the restful discussions seem to center on http and its usage from a browser and what i understand that fielding coined the term when he described the architecture and decisions that lead to his thesis is more about the architecture and of resources than it is about you are really interested in what a restful architecture is and why it read a few times and read the not just chapter next look into dns read about the hierarchical organization of dns and how referrals then read and consider how dns caching read the http specifications and in and consider how and why the caching works the way that it it will just the final revelation for me was when i saw the similarity between dns and after understanding why soa and message passing interfaces are scalable starts to think that the most important trick to understanding the architectural importance and performance implications of a restful and architectures is to avoid getting hung up on the technology and implementation concentrate on who owns who is responsible for then think about the and

i think intellij gets it version for 30 you be any more restrictive than part is if your unregistered version is so crippled as to be how do you expect people to decide to buy they have to try features before they decide they like them and want them but the notion some vendors have that people will buy something on the promise of features they been able to try is is at the most liberal end of the you can basically download a version of their software and just use they treat licensing as a social problem and a lot of merit to that should never nag or otherwise annoy your potential customers possibly expiring the software after a predetermined the most notice you should give is expires in n on say a splash screen or other thing you can and should do is provide a low barrier to entry for your a cheap not academic or personal marketing is also a good by this i mean take offered free to approved open source for the technical aspects of be too concerned about the technical never choose any scheme that annoys your users worse slows down your software some schemes or violates the security of the operating system like the sony rootkit your enforcement is not meant to be if people want to steal your software they the enforcement system is there as a gentle reminder nothing for a social not a technical

i think the answer is going to be the development expertise and the project needs that will decide web forms is so heavily used that it likely going away anytime there are so many custom controls and support such as components and the main benefit of web forms is how easy it is to get a dynamic website up and it really is a rad way of developing once that team has more experience with creating larger websites with much higher demands in terms of and then they will look towards other solutions for in this they will realize that web forms are harder for they may also see that viewstates reduce performance and look for possible mvc has the stated it is unlikely that anyone will convert their sites to use this new framework right away or it requires the team to learn the new and work out the new the team will have to learn new ways to do the exact same for how easy is it to support uploading a file using i saw there a reason you create a site using mvc and web forms so you may see more hybrids in the near but i doubt that web forms will ever go kind of think about web forms like the way vb1 changed the way windows applications are created on the to this the rad way of creating application still exists and will never go

i think your second assumption may be is the right way to check for of two not overload resolution for operators is at compile not run the compiler can definitively know the types of the objects applying an operator it since the compiler cannot be sure that an is going to be something that has an override for it falls back to the default implementation of see this more try defining an for and adding two unless you explicitly cast to it will fail to because the compiler tell that a particular is an and there is no default implementation to fall back to in of your frustration probably stems from the fact that implements an and everything is an so the compiler can successfully resolve operations like for all when you overrode you expected to see the same behavior but and because the best match the compiler can find is the original all comparisons to use equals rather than is not a viable especially when passing your types to libraries as my this is precisely what you should be is the right way to check for of two sometimes semantic equality is just reference in which case you need to change in other as in your override when you need a stronger equality contract than reference for you may want to consider two equal if they have the same social security or two equal if they have the same and are not the same whenever you need to override you should override but almost never the other way is more of a syntactical some clr languages visual even permit you to override the equality

i understand the question you want the data to load after the page is in the if this is the then you can fire an event with javascript when the page loads on the method used is to put a hidden not any button on the page and it with the event of the button click event will need to be wired in the also the button would have to be in an update panel that either contains the grids you want to be bound or has the appropriate triggers to cause them to might look at jquery to get manage when this code gets the your code method will fire after the entire dom is which is faster than waiting on the entire page to load and so

i was doing something like cross platform cross language i would create a since the languages are similar in syntax you could make a translator easy then instead of calling java or apis directly from the you would call your which would re implement the java and apis you would in this way you could create a cross language sandbox if you since the main differences in java and are object i would get those by reflecting the and then reconstruct the then it would be easy to have an interpreter run through and implement the function bodies and convert properties to getters setters already knowing the structure of the this of course is assuming some of the features in and become very difficult to would be but probably not as complex as reconstructing a core in java by and having to have 2 teams working on them if this idea sparks some inspiration i might create i would really rather see a simpler stable mono installation for i think a code level interpreter based on a set of common api classes is something very possible to write with a team in a week or

i work primarily on intranet apps this been too much of an issue with i often do apps for other departments and especially when the project is we do sign a memorandum of understanding with regard to the project and since i work in an agile none of those things are which is often hard to explain to other departments that worked this way typically i will include a description of the process itself a couple of paragraphs explaining how the project is a cooperative venture between them and that together we determine when the time the mou is actually already invested a number of hours in the project discovering what the requirements are are handled at a standard hourly based on that coupled with an estimate of my velocity and similarity to previous i give an broad estimate of the amount of time and cost for the required features again that the real cost is determined by which features we actually implement and how long it really this takes a fair amount of but since been working together to develop the requirements i usually have that with the individuals that dealing with i often try to leave the actual estimate out of the but will include it if their i do try to give them a budget experience is that once the project starts and you start delivering value to the they are rarely they ask for pay more than the original project we both agree that some of the original features are not but i always expect after they really have no way of knowing for sure until they actually see things in operation what it is that they really more often than we drop some features and add others based on the actual i suppose if we there be any point to using agile think the key issue is suggest working with a new customer on smaller projects or explicitly breaking a large project into smaller projects to develop once they and you know that you can trust each other to build the right product with the right i think the risk and there always is one of the customer pulling out abruptly is

i would move the caching outside of your class that contains the business logic and keep your business logic pure and allow you to control the caching independent of the but not your question need did not mention if take more of a hit potentially calculating the things multiple until the cache is the simple approach there would itself should ensure that this is you wish to explicitly block whilst the cache is being then you already have the semantics to do so in your code however i recommend this synclock if end this stops you blocking on every call once the cache is hot and will yield better performance as well as protecting you more from potential race in as soon as you have two different you open yourself up to potential deadlocks far beyond the scope of this for a caching

idea is that you create a unique number for the and when the form is posted you save this unique number in the database in the record that you are before saving you check if that number has already been in that case a form that has been reposted by you are updating a you only have to check if that record has been saved with the same unique but if you are adding a new record you have to check if any other record has that guid is a good number to use as very unlikely that you get a a 31 bit random number that the class can produce is also pretty unlikely to give but the 128 bits of a guid makes it a lot more have to create the guid value in the just use in the code that initialises the you can put the guid in a hidden field in the in the database you only need a field that can store a guid either a guid data type if available or just a text field large enough to hold the text representation of the can use the method to get the string representation of a guid value that you can put it in the using gives the most compact 32 hexadecimal digits without using gives the more recognisable format to get the guid back from a string you just use

ideas off the top of my process monitor process to check what goes on during a build this will let you see if is for instance in mind that response files are probably created with which should prevent disk writes if moved my to a and that gives me minor speedups in a ramdisk that supports automatically disk so you have to use boot scripts to do sequential of a single disk image is faster than syncing a lot of small your header files on the and override your compiler standard paths to use the ramdrive will likely not give much of an improvement after as the os caches the standard your source files on your and sync to the ramdisk the other way check out for doing realtime synchronization between folders it achieves this via a filter so only synchronizes what is necessary only does changes 4kb write to 2gb file will only cause 4kb write to the target figure out how to make your ide build from the ramdrive although the source files are on your and keep in mind that need a ramdrive for large

important distinction between valuetypes and reference types is that value types have these a int32 and all other value types have no an int32 is essentially indistinguishable from any other int32 with the same value type exist either on stack or as a part of a reference type one special case is when you cast a value type instance to an object or an interface this is called and it simply creates a dummy object which only contains the value that can be extracted back on the other have an a does not equal any other because they are separate instances on the gc some reference types provide equals method and overloaded operators so that they behave more a string equals other string even if they are in fact two different when you have a it can either contain the address of a valid or it can be when value type objects are they are simply an integer a float boolean or if you need to distinguish between and you need to use either a separate boolean better use the class in which is simply the value plus a boolean also support in the clr so that boxing of a nullable with results in a null not in a boxed structure with as it would if you were to implement this structure

in response to it is crucial that the database be optimized in addition to the hibernate when you think about after all the work hibernate in the end it is just querying the if the database perform well or missing poorly set up table it matter how much you tune on the flip side if your database is set up well but hibernate the caching is not set up and you are going back to the database a lot more then you need then performance will suffer as it is always important to tune the system end to but start at the foundation and work curious what you mean about do you mean columns have been added to tables that represented in the hibernate data tables have been i think anything like that would affect performance likely data integrity if you are not all the goal of the object model should not be match the database schema you want to abstract the underlying data complexity joins that is the whole point of using something like for example lets say you have things very and application code should be able to do something having to know that underneath it is a one to many the details in your hibernate code control how the load is done that answer your question then please provide more

indexes are lossy to an meaning that the dbms has to deal with false indexes are lossy because each document is represented in the index by a length the signature generated by hashing each word into random bit in an all these bits together produce an document when two words hash to the same position there will be a false if all words in the query have or then the table must be retrieved to see if the is do not have this so depending on the data being there may be some performance difference between the for text search behavior and for a general purpose

is a cocoa n00b question been programming gui applications for years in other but now i would like to understand what is for the following trivialized have a simple custom that allows the user to draw simple shapes within its implementation is like draw a white nsrect bounds is a nsmutablearray instance whose elements are each wrapping an for in nsrect in addition to drawing the shapes in the we draw the shape based on the current drag can see how simple this code the array instance variable acts as the model that the method uses to draw the new are added to every time the user performs a which also implemented in this custom my this were a cocoa what would be the idiomatic way for my custom view to update its other how should the custom view notify the controller that another shape needs to be added to the list of right the view tracks shapes in its own which is fine as an implementation but i do not want to expose this array as part of my custom public i would want to put and undo code in a centralized place like the controller rather than have it littered all over my custom in my past experience with other gui programming models are managed by an object in my controller and the view generally update them directly the view communicates when something by dispatching an or by calling a method on a controller it has a reference or using some gut feeling is that idiomatic cocoa code would expose a property on my custom and then wire the controller object another object hanging off of the document to the as its in the xib then the view can call some methods like on the but it seems like there are any number of other ways to do such as having the controller pass a reference to a model object list of directly to the custom view or having the view dispatch a notification that the controller would listen to and then the controller updates the should a custom view update a model

is a good easy to install and easy to use from have a system using stompserver in production for sending out emails and processing other jobs saves the emails to the a handler in django sends an event to stompserver and stompserver passes the event to a consumer process which does the asynchronous task the scales up quite nicely because you can add consumer processes at runtime two consumers can send twice as many and the consumers can be on seperate one slight complication is that each consumer needs its own named queue so django needs to know how many consumers are available and send events to each queue in a consumers listening on the same queue will both get each message if you only want one consumer process then this an previously had processes which polled the database continuously for jobs but found that it was adding a lot of load to the even when nothing needed to be

is a hash which is a one way turning an input of any size into a output bit in this a cryptographic hash function is one for which it should not be possible to find two inputs giving the same output except by brute force with a function you should need to try on average message to find such a due to something called the birthday paradox google it for fact for sha1 this is no longer the case the algorithm is cryptographic terms at broken with a collision attack described by xiaoyun wang et al that beats a classic birthday the sha2 family is not and a process is underway by nist to agree on a sha3 algorithm or family of is an asymmetric encryption encrypting an input into an output that can then be decrypted a hash algorithm which be it uses a different key for encryption public than for decryption private this can therefore be used to receive encrypted messages from others you can publish your public but only you with the private key can then decrypt the messages that have been encrypted with you reverse the keys for it can be used to generate a digital signature by encrypting something with your private anyone can decrypt it with the public key if they are sure the public key belongs to then they have confidence that you were the one who encrypted the this is normally done in conjunction with a hash function you hash your then encrypt that with your private giving a digital signature of a fixed length for your input

is basically programmatic access to the virtual memory sub you 1g and you mmap you get a pointer to file as if it were in at this stage nothing has happened save the actual mapping operation of reserving pages for the file in the large the the longer the mapping of order to start reading data from the you simply access it through the pointer you were returned in the mmap you wish to parts of the just visit the area like to make sure you visit all of the pages you want to since the vm will only load the pages you for say within your 1g you have a 10mb area that like to map the simplest way would be to just your or whatever data structure you letting the vm page in data as if you that the of the and that your page size for your vm then you can just cast the mmap pointer to a char and just iterate through the load 10mb of data from int offset offset offset 10 1024 offset 4 char mmapptr deref pointer to force mmap char c for l1 and l2 mmap has nothing to do with all about how you access the using the underlying vm anything that addresses data within the block will work from you change any of the the vm will automatically flush out old pages as new pages are needed if you actually do change then the vm will write those pages back for

is designed to be abstract enough to use other transports besides that among other that it take advantage of certain aspects of http restful usage of urls and or also bypasses existing mechanisms for the same reason to be this means it take advantage of the such as sequence flow service discovery a connection on a port means the service uses xml for all of its serialization while that means that data is with just an xml it introduces so much boilerplate that you really need a soap parser in order to function and at that you a software have lost the benefit of xml who cares what the payload looks like over the wire if you need to handle it requires wsdl in order to describe the wsdl itself a but it tends to be advertised as much more than it really in many a single wsdl is and code is from and it never that requires a lot of tooling around without actually solving the original problem to communicate between different any and since most soap services run over the original problem was mostly solved to begin

is how to do this properly using the idea is turn a decently marked up html form into nicer color and size swatch buttons for users that have benefits of this method are you can easily or components and have the form still it will work for users that hvae and if it will be accessible via keyboard and screen it also requires no extra code on and will be a lot easier to use with a form of the work is done with css with only minimal javascript to add the finishing working example example can be found it includes both color and size i have only included the colors here as there is only a slight difference in the css between the markup the form here are the you may obviously want to add like a wrapper around the whole or use other so may seem a lot for but there are several things going on the whole container is flagged as so everything within can be targeted appropriately with css i add a class corresponding to the and a class on each echoing the value to allow css to add appropriate styles the rest is pretty much your standard form javascript is very all we do is detect which radio input is currently selected and flag the container with a thus allowing css to highlight it notify css that js is for every radio redo every function refresh this trigger initial this of triggering click to enforce the initial run may be unsafe if you have click handlers higher i use this method for is where the real magic the idea is that we can tuck the input controls out of view and style the labels as color so long as the attributes on the labels correctly point to on the inputs then clicking the labels will suffice to select the control need to target things only within so that users that have javascript but still have css will see the radio input some sort of class could alternatively be added on the wrapper to get the same thing float the buttons and give them a more attributes are lined up horizontally li border 1px solid margin 0 4px 0 padding float overflow position put and on each li so we can shift the input element out of this will keep it but we just no longer have to look at if remove inputs from sight input position left up is turning the labels into if turn color labels into buttons label cursor display height width hide text color buttons in color allowed even if no js label background label background label background set some styles for our highlighted selected if current selected highlight border 2px solid padding the select if you want to add more effects is demonstrated elsewhere on

is kind of hard to give you a good answer as there are lots of unknowns but i will give it show most often heard issue with and wf is that both use the threadpool and are not aware of each this problem depends mostly on your site are wf by default uses only a few threads in the threadpool per proc to execute workflows and another for the the problem is usually solved by using the manual wf scheduler as wf then uses the host ie the one used by now this can be good or bad depending on your first of all the threadpool size has been growing and is now up to 250 threads per proc so threadpool starvation is unlikely to be an issue unless it is a high load a downside of using the manual scheduler is that all ie the become if you need something from the workflow to finish the request but if it is fire and forget your request is now waiting for the workflow to finish or reach some idle so in some cases you will be better off with the default scheduler in you it all depends on what you are doing and the server thing to keep in mind is that iis will recycle the appdomain after a specific i believe 25 hours by or number of when that happens the wf runtime is destroyed with the next request i recreated in another if you are not using persistence all your workflow state will be lost and existing workflows will be depending on the amount of time a workflow takes this could be a problem or may not hard to tell from my

is no single it depends on your and the key point is ownership of the disposable resource represented by the as skeet points sometimes helpful to look at examples from the here are three examples that behave always exposes a disposable property it is considered to own the underlying and disposing the streamreader always disposes the underlying never exposes a parent it is not considered to own its so disposing the directoryentry never disposes its this case a new directoryentry instance is returned each time the parent property is and the caller is presumably expected to dispose arguably this breaks the guidelines for and perhaps there should be a method sometimes exposes a disposable connection but the caller decides if the reader owns therefore the underlying connection using the commandbehavior argument of interesting example is which has a disposable property if this property is set from then the underlying resource is assumed not to be so disposed by the if not set from a reference is generated and a flag is set to ensure it will be you can see this with lutz need to decide whether or not your container owns the and make sure you document its behavior you do decide you own the and the property is you need to make sure your setter disposes any reference somedisposableobject someobject get return set if somedisposableobject grahams rightly points out in comments that better to test for value in the setter before updated the above example to take account of this referenceequals rather than to be although in many scenarios the existence of a setter might imply that the object is not owned by the and therefore be

is not if you think about a type parameter is resolved at compile whereas the is resolved by reflection at having said it is possible by using if you create the class with reflection you can pass in a as a but probably just worth redesigning whatever it is trying to some ideas for a does the come could you pass it in as a type parameter itself so it can be passed could you make an adapter that handles the known types that will be perhaps a switch statement that converts from the to the right sort of generic anything is faster than

is not possible to use managedthreadid in this this is a completely managed concept and has no real representation in the native hence it make any sense to the passing it reason managedthreadid exists is because there is not necessarily a mapping between a native and managed the clr is free to use multiple native threads to run a single managed thread as long as the native thread is compatible with the one it cannot for be in a different com some ways a bit stuck there is no way to guarantee that you will have the same native thread for a given managed you can achieve a very high level of guarantee though if you are for instance running a winforms or wpf application and the call to native code occurs on the ui the reason being that both of these ui frameworks live in sta apartments which makes it very hard even for the clr to switch out from under if in a winforms or wpf application and running this on the ui you can assume a reasonable level of stability for this	
is not really correct to ask why python is slower than how fast is naive interpreters are around ten times slower than optimised i believe there is a java bytcode interpreter written in javascript that probably very the intended question appears to be is the cpython language system slower than the equivalent ibm and oracle jre and microsoft believe the correct answer is the fastest java and runtime are faster because they have large full time technical teams developing them in language systems are easy to any idiot can do i static language systems are more complex to design and a simple static system will tend to run much faster than the equivalent dynamic it is possible for highly optimised dynamic systems to run almost as i understand some smalltalk implementation were quite an often quoted example of a developed dynamic system is the lisp addition if the real grunt is being done by library then the language system may not the language may encourage give to develop more efficient algorithms which can easily wipe out constant factor performance hawtin

is on the right but a word of am sure the second command line is not needed find find is useful if you think that your file may have been but on a big that process can be extra the it find the file if it has been is on a vob with a few months or years of it will simply take too much for each element it would display the all history for versions of that without any possibility to refine that set of versions that solution simply does not and the of the command does not bring any value to the problem at it would only display the version just because of internal comments like hyperlink or hyperlink need to refine your query type of element wanted it is a date for instance would limit the date range to would cleartool find f mylogin descr would only look for files by me for a certain date which is a way to have a smaller set of versions to that i use which is only for the version not for displaying the all history of an element like your file has been run again the same command with the option would only find along with their branches and that are not visible not have a standard path in the if you specify a date with a day the whereas we are not the 28th of april it will always select 0 versions is not relevant for your but if you enter a before by that can lead to the false impression that there is no version to where there actually are versions to be

is probably a dead post but add my two cents of the opinion that build numbers should mean something to everyone who sees so i personally think that this is a good way to name numbers are pretty but from the perspective of the 3rd it still needs to mean something to the released this new version to but it worth a new minor number since we just fixed some so incremented the patch 4th number usually means absolutely nothing to the so you might as well make it useful to you and anyone else in your company that sees so for that number is the svn revision it tells us exactly which revision was responsible for that version so that we can pull it out any any time to recreate branching code obviously achieves this but not to another advantage with an version number is that it easily integrates into nearly every continuous build my two

is the reason for requiring a test plan by links to a great of this issue which includes comments by michael schwern and ovid who are the and maintainers apparently this comes up every once in a while on the list and is a bit of a contentious here are the to not use a test annoying and takes not worth the time because test scripts die without the test harness noticing except in some rare can count tests as they you use a test plan and need to skip then you have the additional pain of needing a to use a test only takes a few seconds to if it takes your test logic is too there is an in the code your test will complete successfully without running the remaining test an observant human may notice the screen output look but in an automated test suite it could go developer might accidentally write test logic so that some tests never really have a progress bar without knowing ahead of time how many tests will be this is to do through introspection and have a method which should be called at the end of the test this is the approach i take fixes the problem where code has an in it fix the problem of logic which unintentionally skips tests its safer to use a but the chances of this actually saving the day are low unless your test suites are complicated they should not be using is a middle its probably not a huge deal whatever your this feature been useful to anyone in the real few people mention that this feature has been useful to them in the real this includes larry michael schwern the feature originates with more than 20 years other languages have this of the xunit type testing suites has the test plan i come across any examples of this feature being used in any other programming

is worthwhile separating the mysql upgrade from the table that reduces the potential range of if restarting the database is a rare then take some time to review the innodb server options before the because many of them need a database the two recommended are and them and you should also look at as it is almost certainly going to be too low if has changed is going to be around for a long it is a very robust format that has some qualities useful for many in it has a fast which can be useful for a smallish table that has no or very few that a very hot table and lots of will benefit from being migrated to innodb because myisam does not support concurrent almost always survives a database crash with nothing more than a innodb is not always so the myisam can also be out from under the even if you lock the table you will very likely get a file that will just innodb files are not so this is why recently went through a mysql upgrade and we only had one sql version parser was fairly forgiving when mixing implicit table joins with explicit version 5 is not so so we took the opportunity to scour the app and upgrade all the to explicit apart from one or two spots that were this was very recommend you setup a test environment with php 4 talking to mysql this will let you test all this

it you specify how big how many programmers will how often do you plan to how we use trac on one big project spanning several years that consists of number of smaller are defined as points where we have some features in subproject ready for first milestone in each subproject is usually the we usually name milestones as name versions are just increments when we implement everything expected for subproject we mark last milestone as subsequent bug fixes go to milestone that we mark name description contains only list of new features or bug documentation is written in wiki and in usually have at least one page about new features that will be implemented in specific it is usually higher level description of expected behavior of there are examples of expected results application should contain detailed description of feature or bug that have to be reporting tickets contain description of bug and steps to reproduce tickets contain detailed description of feature that must be one ticket contains for up to 6 when we plan we divide features to be in range from 1 6 hours of if we estimate that feature needs more than we split it in several tickets so each of them can fit in hours of we picked 6 hours because we feel it is the top that we can estimate with error not bigger than that this 6 hours estimate almost always can be done in range between of there are exceptions from this in our main reason for wrong estimates is in bad specifications that we almost happens because we misunderstood business requirements of our are few trac plugins for estimating and time check this we use and estimation you can enter estimated time for ticket and time spent working on then you can get reports how much time you spent on and how much time you need to two we can pretty accurately estimate time needed to do some when we correctly understand users needs and we usually can deliver in promised our stats show that we overestimate time needed for tickets for about

its been a few years since done anything with java servlets here so going from would expect the thread safety problem here is in the check for when looking at threading issues the thing one must understand is that a thread can be interrupted between any two machine instructions just any line of that is to that not threadsafe i is shared as i 1 is two an and a the thread can get interrupted between the add and the store and only one of the adds will same thing is occuring in this suppose for a two threads make a request on the same session as goetz suggests from frames or ajax one enters this code successfully retrieves the then attempts to get the since it does not yet null is the thread is then interrupted by another request which does the same it also gets the two requests then proceed in any since both retreived a null reference for the attribute since the cart had not been stored at that both threads will create a new cart object and both will try to store one will loose and those changes to the cart will be thus this code is not for the second half of your i am not familiar with the atomicreference i quickly looked over the java api for atomicreference and it might but not in any the most obvious solution i can think of here is to use a basically what looking to do is have mutual exclusion on the portion of your provided your cart object is atomic we only need to protect the getting and setting of i think something like this could syncronized shoppingcart shoppingcart cart if cart new return session cart i know much about the performance of java monitors so not sure what kind of overhead this would this would have to be the only location where cart is the syncronized keyword means that only one thread can enter the method atomicgetcart at a a lock is used to enforce this lock is simply an object that can be owned by only one thread at a this way you no longer have the race condition that was in the other this

java way is that you should consider what data most suits your remember that in java a list is an not a concrete data you should declare the strings as a and then initialize it using the arraylist strings new separation of abstract data type and specific implementation is one the key aspects of object oriented arraylist implements the list abstract data type using an array as its underlying access speed is virtually identical to an with the additional advantages of being able to add and subtract elements to a list this is an operation with an and that if you decide to change the underlying implementation later on you for if you realize you need synchronized you can change the implementation to a vector without rewriting all your the arraylist was specifically designed to replace the array construct in most if java was being designed entirely possible that arrays would have been left out altogether in favor of the arraylist arrays keep all the data in a contiguous chunk of memory would the use of an array to store thousands of strings cause problems all collections store only references to not the objects both arrays and arraylist will store a few thousand references in a contiguous so they are essentially you can consider that a contiguous block of a few thousand references will always be readily available on modern this does not guarantee that you will not run out of memory of just that the contiguous block of memory requirement is not difficult to

joys of multimonitor programming are i think there are about 5 blog posts on coding horror on the topic often code in windows on my main and have my mac laptop set up to the i use the mac both to compile mac builds but also as my web no kvm or a casual conversation at a conference led me to the could i use two independent machines to literally move some windows from one machine to so i could use one display as from the googling suddenly shows that this is possible in some situations for question is whether any have tried such a we have unique needs especially with multiple text windows and and this kind of tool may be a huge win or a huge solution feels like a combination of easy kvm switching and multiple it sounds like a programming so advice or especially reports of actual experience in a programming environment would be greatly useful before i invest in the rather complex like asking for something that kind of combination of a software kvm but the vnc would need to break out the app windows and allow individual manipulation that maxivista commercial which is vista for all the looks like demand for a cool app if anyone has the drive to be first in this new laptop as a second programming

js to change the style property of any element creates a very high specificity rule which is hard to detect and and less flexible when dealing with multiple style effects you wanted a border as well as a now you have twice as much work to invariably it is far better from a and point of view to modify the style of an element but to change class and let css do the work for i want to change to this so define a class in my 1px solid then modify the element where i need to like the in practice actually wrap that class modifying code in a more general wrapper to protect myself from assigning the same class and make removing it again but in principle you can see that it would now be trivial to change the effect of at just a single it allows for normal and much easier to detect the element has a highlight class than it is to check if got a background colour of foo and a border of quite importantly adds semantic self documenting code is a

just want the just to be able to upload or and then simple approach is just to test that the file ends in or before storing it on the this should be part of a much more validation of what the filename is allowed to contain before you let a filename anywhere near the the rules about what can go in a filename are complex on some platforms usually best to create your own filename independently with a name and any case there is no guarantee that the browser will send you a file with a usable name at and even if it does there is no guarantee that name will have or at the even if it is a text or csv platforms simply do not use extensions for file you can try to sniff the contents of the file to see what type it might this is highly for be plain or a variety of other better to give the user an explicit control to say what file type uploading use one file upload field per where it gets really say accepted the upload and stored it as and the web server is correctly serving it as the what do you think the browser interprets it plain you should be so problem is that browsers trust your and instead sniff the contents of the file to see if it looks like something serve the above snippet as plain and ie will happily treat it as this can be a huge because html can include scripts that will take over the access to the site this point you might be tempted to sniff the file on the for example using the to check it contain but this is doomed to the command does not sniff for all the same html tags as ie and other browsers sniff differently quite easy to prepare a file that will claim is not but that ie will nevertheless treat as if it is approaches such as will give you only a false sense of this is a convenience tool for loose guessing of filetypes and an effective security this point your last desperate possibilities are things all files from a separate so that a script injection attack purloin the credentials of your main all files through a cgi adding the header so that browsers attempt to display them accepting uploads from trusted

key question does it make sense for more than one application to use the if it should be in a class if you may want to put it in a class library just for the sake of separation have one assembly per tier in an but you just put it in your your sanitization is then putting it in a class library would definitely be the right know of people who write almost no code in executable and put almost in class libraries so the application basically just wraps the class i tend to go quite that far	
key to this is examining any information you recieve and then display use in code on the form variables if they contain javascript that you store and later redisplay is a security as are any thing that gets concatenated unexamined into a sql statement you potential gotcha to watch for are attacks that mess with the character for instance if i submit a form with character set but you store and later display in latin with no translation then i might be able to sneak something past your the easiest way to handle this is to always display and store in the same character is usually a good never depend on the browser to do the right thing for you in this set explicit character sets and examine the character sets you recieve and do a translation to the expected storage set before you validate

kind of are we talking if you only have you probably need to your code into packages just for the sake of your project the first distinction you want to make is to separate code from the underlying datamodel and the having a cleanly separated layers is crucial in order to be able to do proper unit having trouble in getting rid of the circular it is probably the case the the classes are actually and should reside in the same the abstraction layers right is probably one of the most important aspects when designing the overall

kinda need to decide on this to see if i can achieve it in a couple of hours before the deadline for my school project is due but i understand much about data structures and i need 2 things i need to they will probably use different data need a data structure to hold profile the profiles must be search able by name and social security the ssn is so i probably can use that for my i suppose hash maps is the best bet but how do i use the ssn in an hash map to use that as an advantage in looking for a specific a basic and easy to understand explanation would be much need a data structure to hold records about need to know which are cities with most cities less visited and the profile is pulled from the data structure in for data about the visit a specific is the third data structure i need for my project and the data structure that i have no idea where to suggestions as for which type of data structure to use are if with examples on how to old the data above in a first data structure is already done talked about it in previous the second one is posted here on and although the other group members are taking care of that i just need to know if what we are trying to do is the the third one is the one i need most data structure in c for these two

know anything about flight and you listed anything in particular they consist so this is mostly a guess about writing a fs in excels at exploratory i think that since fss been around so and there are free and that it would not benefit as much from this type of sims are mostly written in natively compiled if looking for pure runtime in lisp this tends to mean type declarations and other if you get the performance you want with naive your might end up looking a lot like and lisp as good at c at writing lot of a is interfacing to a graphics library like which is written in depending on how your ffi opengl bindings this make your code look like you might not have the big win that lisp does a web app consists of generating a tree structure of plain which lisp is great took a glance at the flightgear source and i see a lot of structural boilerplate even a straight port might end up being half the use strings for keys all over the place have they use xml for config files have a runtime simply switching to native lisp constructs here could be big win for minimal looks at all even the simply a matter of keeping everything and lisp will be great at this because be a lot the neat thing about lisp is that you can use oo for organizing the and fp for computation within each i say just start writing and see where it takes

looked at the javascript added to the event by a timer on one of my i think it would be easy to modify unless you really want to get into overriding the properties mix it with more client side what happens in your div when you is updated asychronously can hidden when a user certains the actions performed on the if so you could just disable the timer on the server in response to the events in the got a updatepanel in a webform with a the checkbox autopostbacks and has a checkedchanged event if the checkbox is the timer is enabled and the content gets updated on each tick if the checkbox is not checked the timer is the autopostback works even if the timer is you are using client side javascript in your div i still think that the autopostback would be the easiest

looking at your i would say that you should reorder the comparison to take advantage of when using boolean stringitem in x comparison of length is always going to be an operation the length is being stored as part of the it count each character every whereas the call to startswith is going to be an where n is the length of query the length of the whichever is placing the comparison of length before the call to if that comparison you save yourself some extra cycles which could add up when processing large numbers of think that a lookup table is going to help you as lookup tables are good when you are comparing the entire not parts of the like you are doing with the call to you might be better off using a tree structure which is split based on the letters in the words in the at that you are really just recreating what sql server is doing the case of and that would just be a duplication of effort on your

looks like gae has chosen a subset of jdk as app engine jdk white is very unfortunate as one gets class linkage errors all over the place with most common java libraries that deal with data class loading and although some omissions may be for deprecated or legacy there are others that are my specific concern is with streaming pull parsers which was just added to jdk after a long delay was finalized at about same time as jdk omitting this makes it harder to do scalable xml as i understand is that not only are classes but they can not even be added because of security this is an philosophical question that probably just gae devs could answer for sure why are some apis dropped from standard jdk seemingly thanks for for what worth i really do not see how security would have anything to do with not including aspects are relevant for great many other things i need for and can see why they are so understandable boilerplate just not applicable for this api is just a set of interfaces and abstract for crying out but more it has exactly the same ramifications as including dom and jaxp interfaces which are included it looks like this issue has been brought to attention of google on whitelisting stax hoping that this and similar issues can be resolved behind google app engine excluding standard jdk

looks like so i give it away but notice a few win when you have three of the same thing in a in a or along a not that you need to check whether there are three noughts or three crosses in a but rather that there are of the same in a could start by writing a function which determines whether a or diagonal has three of the same kind of thing that thing a blank then call that function once for each and	
looks like the calculation referencing uses a spherical coordinate the formula is almost part of what could be throwing your calculation off is the radius the is the radius of the sphere in this as you may the earth really a more of an suggest trying the formulation more accurate want to use vincenty or haversine to not trying to imply that the bulk of the error reporting is due to using a spherical coordinate that error is much smaller than what the formula adjustment i supplied was intended to be a clearer version of the as the was a value of the radius of the earth adjusted to a degree which is less intuitive than simply using worth noting that for calculating very small using the formula above is highly accurate to about 1m as long as the system doing the calculation is working with enough decimal using a float in modern computing gives you this

made some research a while specific question from might give you some additional you use nhibernate for a project with a legacy which is partly out of your of your points of interest i can is better if you control both the data model and the can answer it the other way if you have control over the data model and thus facing some legacy ibatis is the better is repeatedly called simpler to learn does this have maintenance consequences easy to hard to depends what you want to do with if you have a domain driven development approach then ibatis might get painful by if you just do simple data manipulation and have a full blown domain model then nhibernate might be a overkill by the both make it easy to switch the underlying database have mechanisms to shield you off from a specific database but i admit that have not done intense research in this skilled do your developers need to be with you use you need more sql skills than using ibatis you always need to code some nhibernate require you to code sql statements it even can do the ddls for powerful features will require you to go to old good which will be other personally find that ibatis much more you can get things done very nhibernate is more but has much more which you can use in wrong is possible to combine the use of nhibernate and you can use nhibernate for your business for reporting where you just read data out of fallback to your application has a longer life cycle and a lot of business consider it has a lot of feature aiding you in handle business community around nhibernate is very active and come up with useful	
main advantage of the table not using it for is instead of having to declare the in every place you wish to use you are able to define it but have multiple references to this does mean that it is executed only once per iterations of this thank you to all those that have the query definitely has the potential to be executed multiple times if referenced multiple the query optimizer ultimately makes the decision as to the cte should be	
main benefit of memcached is that it is a that means you can generate and serve from cache across many servers is why memcached was all the previous answers seem to ignore this it makes me wonder if they have ever had to build a highly scalable app is exactly what memcached is interactive developed to enhance the speed a site which already doing 20 dynamic views per day for 1 million users bunch of webservers and a bunch database memcached the database load to almost yielding faster page load times better resource and faster access to the databases a memcache the answer if your application is only ever likely to be deployed on a single you are ever likely to use more than one server scalability and memcached is always a good

mainly not a question of how to make service and communication protocol is not the main issue with wcf you can expose your application methods via spectre of merely a question of application question here is how do you like to implement if your application is normal windows then it have just because service should not have so need separate gui is standalone application that somehow communicates with your say via in this case plugins should also be implemented in two plugin for service and plugin for i it would be too complex to of 1st both service and gui are packed in one it looks in what mode started or and either monitors mail or shows since this is one the configuration is also the so you will have single registry for i that in gui mode application will search for started service and configure drawback gui could be run only make a sort of gui service sends gui to simple which shows in this case you have one place for all app code and but executed in part in in part in client but you also need such universal client a little more about variant 3 we see that solution already exists it is web it would be simplest to implement your service as part a web and gui would be another if you are unfamiliar with html and javascript you can implement gui using you can host right in your is the good but i afraid it adds unnecessary

make it work you must both embed some object type information in data it is only useful for and usually use external schema definition which otherwise would not be needed xml schema for since basically a generic type has same problems as orm hibernate has to use ugly way or discriminator another way to put data is not quite the same as object tries to preserve more of object i am assuming that what you want is basically something pet possibly get an exception if pet is an abstract l this is not the you could just simply bind to dog jackson project has request for doing just which allow you to do what you this solution will mostly work for as there is no standard way of passing object type info within with xml this can sort of be done with xml schema defined which identifies schema which is then mapped to class rather complicated but it does added support for this implemented feature so it can be used for generating type to allow proper handling of polymorphic it should work with systems given that you can fully configure details of how type information is to be and is not limited to using java class

manipulation uses native functions to perform simple browser vendors optimize you are building the row from internally jquery is using to build the collection which then patches into the is slow in comparison because js code needs to loop through the dom newer browsers have native selection handling which provides dramatic speedups to selector based as time moves on this will be less of a is how the query in breaks through every element returned elements within the and test with every element still remaining and collect the final is different for jquery as engine moves through the selector the other way beginning with getting all input elements and then testing the parent that the js selector engines implement a lot more of the css selector spec than is actually usable with css implemented by current exploiting and knowledge of the we can optimize selector can be optimized in a few different you know what element type the is faster for filter first for type and then for the class for only those this apply for a very small subset of but that is almost never the case in single class test is the slowest of the common people actually loop is faster than two this only finds input elements and then directly filters them by type since are never unique may also be skipped smart engines will try to do this because unique is more direct more complex selector may actually be faster if it is more direct move the search context up to the table this i mean that instead of looping through the and searching for the checkbox in every leave them alone until after the loop and then select them all at a point of this is to eliminate the overhead of firing the selector engine up but instead do everything in one this is presented here for completeness rather than something that i think would return massive the row from assigning events as you row cell row cell may be impossible for reasons of ajax or other templates out of your the speed may not be worth turning your code into this sort of but sometimes this may make if none of these work for or return too performance it may be time to rethink the method you can assign an event listener higher up the tree and grab the events instead of you may want a faster if do some stuff way you do anything and the user actually requests

my experience this is a challenging thing to implement there is a lot of resistance not overtly most people even managers agree it is the best thing but when push comes to shove no one wants to make time for while you are figuring out the just let others know you are happy to review their code and ask others to review code you some statistics on the time spent looking at code and issues go overboard just keep enough to show whether it was useful time or best book i have read about this topic is not that freebie one which is basically a sales although a good start but this get caught up in the process this is about improving the work	
my experience with a couple of coverity prevent for was decidedly worth finding some bugs even in good and a lot of bugs in the worst others have already covered technical so focus on the political the developers whose code need static analysis the are the least likely to use it so afraid need strong management in practice as well as in otherwise it might end up as just a checklist to produce impressive metrics without actually getting bugs any static analysis tool is going to produce false probably going to need to dedicate somebody to minimizing the annoyance from by triaging prioritizing the and tweaking the commercial tool should be extremely good at never showing a false positive more than that alone may be worth the even the genuine defects are likely to generate my advice on this is not to worry comments grumbling that obviously destructive bugs are biggest piece of advice is a corollary to my first take the cheap shots and look at the painfully obvious bugs from your worst some of these might even have been found by compiler but a lot of bugs can slip through those when suppressed by really blatant bugs can be politically with a top ten list of the funniest which can concentrate minds if used

my opinion a complex compiler is more difficult to write than a complex emulator for the simple reason that the compiler involves much more designing your language xx there is a whole lot of factors to consider not to mention optimizing the output of the compiler generated code which is a black art in with an emulator you have an already environment with a mostly language that you want to any case i recommend anybody to write and write a compiler because it gives you a deeper understanding of just like doctor needs to know about the body anatomy even though he may not need it in his daily i think both skills are very useful and one can actually combine them they are not would like to add to my opinion above is that creating a programming language including to interact with databases etc and that can evolve with future versions but still remain backwards compatible is one of the more challenging areas in also agree that if the platform is unknown you are reverse engineering something then it is much more difficult to do an but otoh that is not what question was was	
my opinion and in opinion of many industry gurus whom i have maintain that sps should be used as a part of bl and majority of db operations should be done in will always have better performance sps are compiled units and they are syntactically checked and execution plans already in case of arbitrary queries executed from dal will be parsed and syntax checked every time the query is if prepared statements are not used then a query execution plan creations also comes in play each so a new this chirag bhatt	
my own projects i wrote a generalized library which handles this sort of allows me to specify how many attempts may be made in x amount of it allows for a certain number of attempts in a short so that only really unusual behaviour will be record in the database a few ip address the first 24 bits of action that was attempted time of the of attempts each attempt made i query against the partial ip address and the and if a previous attempt was made within a certain window of time then i increment the attempt counter for that if the attempt counter exceeds the number of grace attempts allowed then i check whether the last attempt was within x seconds of now and if return false therefore the action will be blocked the user will be told to wait x seconds before trying if the attempt counter is below the number of grace attempts then i return true and let it a person with the same ip comes by then the previous attempt count be because it will be too long

my question is suppose you have an interface that defines how a converter would be this interface could have a method and another now suppose we want to have multiple convertxml2html you get the you get the two formats you need to convert in 2 strings matter how you get now you need to create an instance of your converter and convert the question is which is to actually create an elaborate if statement or to load the classes through reflection with the class to demonstrate i wrote a little example of what i in my example i have 2 classes p1 and p2 that share an i also create 50000 of them to show of the speed as it turns out the normal invocation is slightly but i think that in a complex example such as the one i mentioned in the the benefits of creating the classes through the class method is more convenient and more what are your class test public static void try random r new date test1start new for i printable p date test1stop new date test2start new for i printable if 0 p new else p new date test2stop new with invocation took with invocation took catch printable public string p1 implements printable public string return p2 implements printable public string return method to create a new instance based on

my this depends on how tightly bound to the component the connections if the connections are to a database that will only be used by the then it make sense to force the users of the component to know anything about those in that keeping the connection strings in a configuration file works or in it might be adequate to keep the connection strings internal to the but to expose the database server name in the config the component is using the same database as the users of the then permit the connection to be passed in as a property of the the component could the choose whether to default to a connection string if the property is not or to throw an exception if the property is not you mind exposing the entire connection string to the then allow the entire string to live in or in use the application settings feature this will cause defaults to be compiled into the yet when the component is these defaults will get written into the they may be edited from you want to limit the parts of the connection string that can be then compile those parts into the expose individual properties for the parts allow to in expose database server application these properties would set the corresponding parts of the connection see the if you already know about

need to find an algorithm for generating every possible permutation of a binary and need to do so without using lists is because the tree itself carries semantics and restraints that cannot be translated into found an algorithm that works for trees with the height of three or but whenever i get to greater i loose one set of possible permutations per height node carries information about its original so that one node can determine if all possible permutations have been tried for that the node carries information on weather or not been if it has seen all possible permutations of the tree is meaning that the right node should always in some cases that i need to cover for this be a leaf while the left node is always either a leaf or a algorithm using at the moment can be described sort of like the left child node has been swap my right node with the left child nodes right set the left child node as if the current node is back to its original swap my right node with the lowest left right swap the lowest left nodes two set my left node as set my left chilnode to use this as original set this node as return return if the left child has not been if the result of trying to permute left child is return the permutation of this else return the permutation of the left child this node has a left node and a right node that are both swap set this node to be desired behaviour of the algoritm would be something like branch branch 0 branch branch 2 1 0 first branch branch 1 second 2 branch branch 1 0 2 third branch branch 0 fourth swap 1 2 so a binary tree without the use of

need to have some way to uniquely identify a row in the database a database table will have a field or fields that serve this purpose by acting as a primary from what you are it sounds like the table have a primary there needs to be some combination of data that can be used to act like a primary the table might hold user and by combining hair address and age this could be sufficient to uniquely identify a why you would want to do this is a little confusing to but we can assume you have a good reason for wanting to do having formulated this you need to put those guys into the clause of your sql update statement to identify the row you want to set name where and height and so risk with doing this is you may run into a situation where more than one user have the same identifying features they are so the update statement will update both rows instead of only

need to poll a web service in some time intervals and just return whatever seems appropriate to your application the messages you and update the progress the process is first step is to actually initiate the operation that must run and second step is to constantly poll the server to see if the operation is you would have to somehow store the current operation status on the i know which technology working so i can only tell you to use something that your framework of choice but make sure the process state is set in a variable that can be persisted is in example in a session synchronizing this value between the running process and the polling method may be such splash screens are rather used in desktop applications or in web applications when the processing is performed on the i think a good idea to try to have an updating progress when the method running asynchronously resides on the a progress indicator like this would be good when loading assets images or other and you can count the currently loaded the total size and so no matter whether the processing operation will be invoked on the server or on the client it must be you want yet another dull indicator in your web you may randomly display some funny quotes or other texts from an solution minimize the time it takes to process the

nice thing about wordpress is that you can go a few different routes trying to accomplish route worked well for me is to list each business as a post and then create categories and to house these once this is you can create custom templates for either category templates if your have a category named and it has the category id of you can create a template named and then wordpress will know to look to that template first and then move on to the regular file and so your category template you can then list out each sub category a function like and call out the children categories from other option is to still go the route of entering in your businesses as a separate filing them under the appropriate but instead of creating a category you can create a page need to do a few things for your template file the necessary template syntax to tell wordpress to look for that as a template file such food a page in wordpress using this new your page template create a new pointing to this such new if while and do other stuff here are other options you can do as and for i would hang out some wordpress user groups to see if you can grab some other

not a huge fan of this we have some software that essentially does this for some calling what they table with column definitions call it this table contains columns like and instance master table just and for each packet type instance definition table this would be this table collects the columns together to form the data structure that for it might hold in this is a since it maps the columns to the packets that use a second database of dynamic implications of this tables are created dynamically to hold the actual for if defined steps a packet type called you might have a table called in your database to hold that use linked to to figure out what field types to create and how big they should you end up with a collection of tables that match the packet type definitions from step using the columns from step i particular like the implications of step creating tables dynamically can lead to some consequences if security designed properly and the input from any fields in your application cleansed especially if this application has an interface that available to untrusted callers the you can create indexes however you want when the tables are created you have a column in step 1 where you flag certain columns as and indexes are created on top of them when the tables are	
not a you could set up a discussion by commit situation using with hooks for a hosted solution and you can also use lighthouse or even fogbugz to work with probably more meant for bug fixing than communication with teams per but i think the basecamp integration might work for a general not perfect but i like it so i thought throw it out think anything out there right now that has the of github perhaps be a good project to actually cvsdude does offer an api for their enterprise so if you wanted to build your own basic discussion system you could do it off of that i suspect looked too closely at it

not any detail on the requirements of your application which is really key to answering the big win for using gwt is the ease of deployment relative to something like there is nothing easier for the user than pointing their web browser at a url and nothing easier for the operations team than pushing code to the bouncing it and calling it a far as the big area where gwt will come up short would be richer data network this stuff is possible with gwt and some help on the server but the limitations of dhtml start to show even with a powerful toolkit like on the other rcp gives you the full power of java 2d to visualize anything you these kinds of features may not be necessary to you but also the ones that make applications really more than just a mess of tree and data grid been developing with adobe flex for several years now and find it to be really having more or less the same deployment advantages as something like gwt but offering the same kind of power as you might want to check that out	
not as immediate as you would you may be interested in the management of tracking rectangles and tracking areas performed by mechanism allows you to define specific areas of your custom an event is generated whenever the cursor enters or leaves the or a mouse button is pressed in this area of this up to you to define what you want your application do in response to these events the rectangle as selected and display it	
not aware of a preexisting app or plugin to do but it be hard to not using rtti or manually assigning event a user rather than so the following may not be quite a list of all published methods in your proper way to do this is to read find each text block that starts with a declaration or a directive and ends with a or within each of these text extract each easy way to do this is to make a list of common event handler types and assume you have this print everything from the list not found in your dfm most comfortable using cygwin or linux tools for a bash script that works in cygwin and should do what you file in echo get a list of common event handling add more types between the egrep awk cut 1 get a list of used event egrep awk compare the files listed in the left column are published but not so you can delete files in the right column were not by our crude search for published event so you can update the first egrep command to find comm clean actually use if not familiar with and install i the default install should give you all of the tools i but not the script to your source directory as a cygwin command your source is in then type and press

not but possibly hard and possibly makes not much is because java is a normal programming as long as you have some way to access the no normally in a modern os the kernel has a layer to allow raw access to hardware in some also already exist drivers in at least the should be no problem to implement in makes possibly not too much because the kernel has to start a jvm to execute the also normally eat up much could also use compiled to be executed natively on the platform with the help of a this is usually not that but it could be suitable for a question does it make sense to implement the driver in or stated in another what is the benefit you hope if you use java for implementing the driver instead of another if you can answer this you should find a way to make it the end the hint to a project that tries to implement a complete os purely based on

not expensive to construct a data context regardless of how many tables it so that be a criterion when deciding whether to have one or more separate data context a new data context is until you actually start using and table instances are created as makes a data context instance expensive is when you use the same instance over and over again for tracking changes to different objects for using a cached instance of a data context in an application for all database operations a long as you use the data context as in a it matter how many tables it can manage at the class definition as you only instantiate the ones you need within the current unit of the data context logically represents the target so it should represent all the entities that are mapped within that whether there are 10 or 100 splitting it up really offers no benefit other than less lines of code in a given but if something you care about then by all have different

not possible since assigning it to a derived class reference would be like saying class is a fully capable substitute for derived it can do everything the derived class can which is not true since derived classes in general offer more functionality than their base class the idea behind could write a constructor in the derived class taking a base class object as copying the like class base public int public void do stuff with class derived base public int public otherdata default public void do some other that case you would copy the base object and get a fully functional derived class object with default values for derived this way you can also avoid the problem pointed out by jon b new d new also new copy construct a derived with values of now

not sure there is one there are so many variables to take into including how far down the development path you comments having been through both and auditing i hope you can see where you are now at terms of could affect these you need to map the user who changed the data you normally then db triggers will need to get this information not but more work and several ways to approach this user executing common user column in each you use db triggers and you rely on affected rows count returned from then your audit triggers need to have this turned or your existing code logic modified to expect db triggers offer more but they are not as anyone with appropriate access can disable the modify data and then enable them in other ensure your db security access rights are a single table for history is not a bad way to although you will have more work to do data to if you are auditing history for multiple especially when it comes to reconstructing the audit you also have to consider locking issues if there are many tables trying to write to one audit an audit history table for each table is the other you just need each column in the audit table to be as well as storing date and time of action and the user associated with the you go with the single table unless you have a lot of time to spend on get too fancy trying to audit only on updates or although it may be tempting to avoid inserts most apps do this more often than updates or reconstructing the audit history does take a fair bit of audit tables can get so have a strategy if they start affecting options include table partitioning onto different basically think about this now and not when it becomes a problem

not sure what you are build and what is the but as a general rule of thumb i do not consider this a grievous security lets look at the attack in the middle attack on the http text traffic an especially one obfuscated against ocr will prevent this but also simply using https as pornel scraping by a remote desktop application https protection will not nor an image as the mess on a screen has to be read by a human anyway human attacker can also circumvent your obfuscated image protection against in the by instructing the listener to archive the image and then go over them if a human is behind the screen then you have no your shoulder eavesdropping if the attacker is simply standing behind the then again you have no note that if your password is then you must show it to the there is no way around one way sites try to mitigate the threat is to send the password by email under the assumption that a user can make sure they read the email when no one is at their own unfortunately email will not even let you have the benefit of encryption to protect the my the best way is to let the user input the password a password obfuscation like normally it is and then only store the hash of the password so you need not store the actual preventing you from showing it to the if you must show it to the user because you are generating then make sure you are over https and just show it all the fanfare just complicates the implementation without giving any security

not the end of the world if i miss a i just wish something would generate at least a warning for problem here is that you always deal with an idisposable by just wrapping it up in a sometimes you need the object to hang around for a bit in which case you will have to call its method explicitly good example of this is where a uses a private eventwaithandle an to communicate between two threads and you want to dispose of the waithandle once the thread is it as simple as some tool just checking that you only create idisposable objects within a

not too sure i completely understand your do you want to have all the pools using the same but just differing by a distinguishing or do you want separate pools of tables within the one with a suffix on each table to distinguish the way you should have multiple databases for two major the first being if you have to change the schema on one it affect the if your load goes up for any other you may want to move the pools onto separate physical machines with new database security access to a database server can be more tightly locked of these things can still be accomplished without requiring separate databases but the separation will make all of this easier and reduce the complexity of having to mentally track which tables you want to operate

not use the current the scripts in your file are all the result of a request coming into the so there should be a context associated with that request which you can understand the need for generating the key based on the hashcode or the there is going to be a separate instance of httpcontext for each request that comes and that instance is going to be specific to the thread that is processing the because of the key is pretty much worthless when based on the instance of httpcontext and the how do you dispose of the datacontext when you are it implements idisposable for a so i would recommend against a shared instance like the it indicates that there is a timer that is running that is executing the instead of the i would recommend setting up a scheduled task which will call a webservice or predetermined page on the site which will perform the then you will always have an httpcontext to work

now completed my first web application using mvc and i still am not grasping why this is getting all the praise and maybe being i know that what makes mvc great is that is forces separation between the presentation layer and the business object or data layer along with its stateless i also know that when you are working with the it appears that the code is less readable my example i guess my question if the separation is the why not just forms view forms code code controller new pagetext pagetitle i might be being but one of the things that i really liked in webforms is the ease in setting object properties like datasources and text it seems like this is completely different in mvc and less readable which makes me wonder about long term looking into the typed i think the readability of the code is substantially mvc

number of features were introduced into which made me such as object extension methods and implicitly typed now in with things like the dynamic keyword getting even more know that each of these features be used in appropriate ways in my view they make it easier for developers to make bad coding decisions and therefore write worse it seems to me that microsoft are trying to win market share by making the coding easy and personally i prefer a language that is rigorous and places more demands on my coding standards and forces me to structure things in an oop are a few examples of my concerns for the features mentioned constructors can do important logic that is not exposed to the this is in the control of the object object initializers take this control away and allow the consumer to make the decisions about which fields to i had not appreciated that you can mix constructor and initializer but this starts to look messy to my mind and so i am still not convinced it is a step developers to extend types using extension methods allows all and sundry to start adding their favourite pet methods to the string which can end up with a bewildering array of or requires more policing of coding standards to weed these implicitly typed variables allows quick and dirty programming instead or properly oop which can quickly become an unmanageable mess of vars all over your my worries do you deal with new features of so that they lead to poorly written	
number of locations as well as the way the location information is transmitted it will help determine the optimal frequently do the 12000 devices send a are the locations reliability requirements do you the sounds of having a service that can capture the requests and just maintain a queue internally of things to save to the database should work i believe msmq will be of use to you unless you can change the transmission and even it may or may not be given the comments i would suggest something where you have a tcp listener pass requests off to the threadpool to would take a look at about setting up a tcp listening server using the thread the biggest potential problem i see is the number of requests from what going to have roughly 400 requests this is going to be a bit of a challenge to handle without a pretty good system in the threadpool will probably perform better than trying to do your own since want to avoid the overhead of having to create new threads definitely want to have very little delay in the main processing loop or no sleep at since have one request per ms on a single sleep tends to time slice at ms so you probably want any sleep in the would that you may find this work too since the raw amount of connections may be if there is any way you could convert to udp packets being it may get you better throughput the expense of some

of the base type of an enumeration has to be a numeric value so you have an enumeration with base type the following going to enum class1 intermediate class2 career development change it to use the default base type of something like the following will but change the names as you see fit might want to use the course name instead of the for remember also that you should use meaningful names whenever possible in an enum know you said you want specific code but i think this one illustrates my point much more clearly than any on the right track with the but you have to think of how to relate the enumeration to the array of string an enumeration is nothing more than a finite set of glorified with the above you have two values named and so in the you have to map each of these values to the string there are multiple ways to do but the simplest one would be a switch for return return however is to explicitly map the enum values to its base and use the base type to index into your for if you have the enum value1 value2 you can index directly into an array using this may be of use and is the

of the other answers given are but i am surprised that no one mentioned that it can be used to help enforce correctness in a compact something like int n 10 basically n is a whose initial value is dependent on a condition the easiest alternative is to make not a this would allow an ordinary if to initialize but if you want it to be it cannot be done with an ordinary the best substitute you could make would be to use a helper function like return else return int n the ternary if version is far more compact and arguably more

of the point opposed it is illegal to convert a to a const for reasons explained your main problem is that the test you are expecting to fail when reached the empty string at the end of the animals is that statement is actually checking if the pointer which points to the string is not checking if the string is an empty string string containing the single character is not the same as a null other once reached the last element of the animals evaluates to a pointer which happens to point to a string that is therefore the test and your loop continues forever it continues until you run far enough past the end of the animals array that it causes a can fix this either by replacing with null when you create the animals or you can change the while check to check 0 any other way of checking for an empty string instead of a null note that others pointed out equally serious problems that i

of these are kinds of must be is an is the physical can be only one per as it you have more than one row with a tuple of this note that since a unique key can be over more than one this necessarily mean that each individual column in the index is but that each combination of values across these columns is if not primary or it constrain values inserted into the but it does allow them to be looked up more a more specialized form of indexing that allows full text think of it as creating an for each in the specified	
of those is actually the best terms of how dbas the best would be refno is unique and therefore the primary is the primary add date to the second table as allows you to minimize storage space for those rows that have all three types savings is then you use clauses combining the two tables to do your also allows you to add other types at will without restructuring the you need to keep in mind that third normal form is an quite acceptable to violate the rules to gain performance as long as you understand the records is actually quite small unless you think going to be adding more types in the near go for your option 2 and use zeros for those values that nulls would most likely make your queries a little more

of what you do in programming all day is combining some functions together to build bigger functions from usually you have not only functions in your toolbox but also other things like variable assignments and the but generally your program combines together lots of to bigger computations that will be combined together monad is some way to do this of your most basic to combine two computations together is you say this you mean do then do the result is basically again a computation that can be combined together with more is a simple it is a way of combing small computations to bigger the says the thing on the then do the thing on the thing that can be seen as a monad in object oriented languages is the often you find things like basically means the computation on the and then call the method on the right on the result of it is another way to combine a little more complicated than and the concept of chaining things together with is a since a way of combining two computations together to a new fairly common that has no special is this return return return return value of indicates but there is no real way to abstract out this error even if you have lots of that you need to combine in this this is basically just another monad that combines the function calls by the rule the function on the left returned do return otherwise call the function on the if we had an operator that did this thing we could simply would make things more readable and help to abstract out our special way of combining so that we need to repeat ourselves over and over there are many more ways to combine that are useful as a general pattern and can be abstracted in a enabling the user of the monad to write much more concise and clear since all the and management of the used functions is done in the example the above could be extended to the error checking and then call the right side on the socket that we got as so that we need to explicitly specify lots of formal definition is a bit more complicated since you have to worry about how to get the result of one function as an input to the next if that function needs that input and since you want to make sure that the functions you combine fit into the way you try to combine them in your but the basic concept is just that you formalize different ways to combine functions

of you who use ff3 may be familiar with an interesting new attribute of the address it allows you to do in order to filter through urls that you have viewed if you want to open the following can simply type any of that url that are sufficient to uniquely distinguish the changes the way users can think about because now all they have to remember are the keywords that will help narrow down the potential this feature is but there is a users have a decreased incentive to bookmark and memorize this obviously becomes a problem if a user needs to type in a url at a remote site example during a sales and they fumble around because they cannot remember the url of the snazzy product catalogue that they want to show during a there are ways around this bookmark your urls and copy your bookmarks to your laptop before you go on a use a solution or online bookmarking social bookmarking sites and so question for those users who do not want to use any of the above is there actually a way to dig into the ff3 internals so i can write a script that will extract the components necessary to replicate a users behavior on any 3 address bar

only end up with five items if returns thats the simple answer to your but i see other problems wondering why you have this is that array the same thing as you really need to be using the same array for both not a syntax but you use the property syntax for things that declared as you should write also confused by the code you use to set up the cells are meant to be that you create one then reconfigure it every time in your implementation of your code creates a cell for each item in your this is very and will likely crash your program due to insufficient memory on the iphone if you keep lots of cells in memory like recommended approach is to call if that returns then you set up a cell using the the table view is very and will only ask you to redraw the cell when it needs you dictionary looks really shaky to what if you insert an item after the item with key all the items with key onward will need to be shifted one element to the right to work the way you a ton of bookkeeping that seems rather unnecessary to if you really needed something like this and to be i think you do why you use an which is much easier to

only way to do this is to make sure your code runs in the trusted zone higer like by anything running inside the webbrowser control runs in the zone that the files which are being served come the standard ie security policies are being change this need to change the application which is hosting the webbrowser control and implement a few interfaces on that webbrowser iinternetzonemanager and iinternetsecuritymgrsite are the ones that you should take a look this is not a trivial task and the documentation about this is scarce at this is your code can run with any privileges you and requests are just as easy as resetting high this

order to run a program a bash or binary you need to have execute when you enter a the first word as in the specifies the command to and that is started up as a separate in the case of a shell it executes a new copy of the shell interpreter listed on the and runs the program using that ls 1 lambda lambda 23 mar 25 chmod 744 foo or chmod ls 1 lambda lambda 23 mar 25 you use the that is a shell builtin command that says to source the file into the current that means that it executes the commands in the file as if you had run them from the command right in the current you need only read permission to source a for if you set a variable in a it change the value in the current but if you source a bash script into the current then it does change the cat setvariables echo echo shell function in your is a lot like a but it acts like a command in the current when you source your using that defines that function in the current and it can execute like any other shell function you have far as the permissions are i would bet that before changing the permissions to 100 means only not which is fairly useless for a file since you need to be able to read it and execute it to do you had already sourced the file into your current that would mean that the function was already and it matter the permissions of the file after once the function is defined in the current you can even delete the and as long as that shell is still the function will still be as i see from your edited once you unset the you get an that indicates strongly to me that my hypothesis was and that you had already sourced the file before you changed as i sourcing and executing the file are entirely different and once you source a its permissions matter at the function has already been loaded into the currently running you can tell by running your original experiment after doing the if you you have read and then the function be

other answers talk about how to either avoid recursion or how to use tail or how to simply set a larger stack i think for completeness that worthwhile to consider memory usage patterns answer to allow more memory on lots of of many programmers will allocate buffers inside the recursive and reallocate new buffers when the function is called if return int use return this is a throwaway i bother worrying about invalid input values larger than and i will assume somebody asking a question about programming either knows how to do that or is smart enough to find important point here is that takes up 400 bytes a 32 bit 800 bytes on a 64 bit of the stack each and every time is so if is called recursively 100 then bytes bytes on a 64 bit of stack space are being used for and very likely you can modify the function to reuse the same buffer on each int if return use buffer to avoid int return course you could instead use a which handles some details for you to protect you against memory leaks and buffer overruns for the keeps the data on the heap meaning it will likely use less stack or even 80k may not seem like much but things can add if the function have many other variables then this can dominate stack space if it for the extra space the buffers take up you may be able to call the function far more may seem it does come even in nonrecursive buffers always obvious as they may be strings or for stl such as arrays put all their data on the they actually take a template argument to specify the memory allocation just that the allocator they use by default puts the data on the obviously unless you specify an allocator that somehow puts the data on the the end result will be the using stl containers will probably use less memory than using stack allocated arrays or say because although the data is kept on the heap somewhere the container can only access that data through pointers it keeps if the container is on the stack then those pointers will reside on the and those pointers take up so a one or two element may actually take up more space on the stack than the corresponding

parsing the issue you will have is that each of data in the is not a fixed are of and others are of assuming the format given is really all there is to the issue can be worked reading a you could check for a and if so assume the start of a and read the next 3 it is not a then assume it is a and only read the next 2 there might be in the or time columns in the output as and in different it gets really need your program to have special knowledge about what values are valid in what that is not a valid type of and is not a valid formatting the is depends on the language you most languages have a formatting codes of printf allow you to pad with you are using perl be to this you can use

patterns contribute or detract from the usability of a cli an example consider the cli for the cli is very comprehensive but it is has several glaring i wanted to force the files to lower case into clearcase using unfortunately i wound up on the documentation for its cousin it may seem slight but it cost me more hours than i care to the variation in the middle got provide such nearly identical functionality with such nearly identical there are many better options in my would be better than what they went the code i am working on a cli and this experience made me look at my own i think i have all the basics covered vs short meaningful providing eliminate accurately handling spaces within there is some on this perhaps a bad cli is no different than a cli are type of an api in some the goals are naturally and several factors differentiate cli from a typical one is that cli needs to support scriptability many times perhaps in a series of another is that autocompletion and namespaces exist in the same you always have a nice colorful gui doing stuff for clis must document themselves externally to customer and finally the audience of a cli is vastly different than the standard i appreciate any insight you may for	
patterns have two major they provide you with a way to solve issues related to software development using a proven the solution facilitates the development of highly cohesive modules with minimal they isolate the variability that may exist in the system making the overall system easier to understand and design patterns make communication between designers more this certification can force you to learning them or can boost your i think that this certification will be useful to

pointer arithmetic and relative comparisons are defined only within to be confused with an is a variable any or a memory area allocated with you can compute a pointer to the and this will always work in a standard conforming at things at a lower a pointer is typically implemented as an the size of the integer is large enough to hold the address of any memory the only way for a pointer to overflow is if you exceed the address and that is impossible to do while conforming to the c if you are writing and ignoring the restriction that pointer arithmetic is only valid within an the best way to do this is to take advantage of the knowledge of how pointers are in most modern this then becomes the same thing as checking for overflow with unsigned integer to that will be things like segmented memory of the 8086 or multics and probably other things i may have suppressed from my memory my

probably a good idea to keep the concepts is a and it specify anything about what platform should be in straight code could be compiled to native x86 java msil or anything else you care to think i believe adobe recently made a compiler which generates flash with typical microsoft has created two languages targeting they made the extensions for then they decided it ditched it and tried to pretend it never their best bet for is called but is not it extends and changes the language in a number of nonstandard i believe the standard committee requested that they change the name to avoid but they studio 2005 and newer supports listed under visual think it was that did microsoft has done it after specifying which is actually a reasonably attempt at integrating with they realized that virtually no one uses out that even programmers generally prefer to use when working in and native focusing on making interop between and simpler and more likely to go it and in some cases just not the they originally hoped studio also supports native compiled to x86 machine untainted by these are listed in the dialog under visual if you want to learn you have two which limits you to a language which generates msil instead of native machine and requires to and generally worth the bother because if going to take a dependency on why not write in learn proper which is completely separate from and directly reference key takeaway point is that separate either you compile as which means the compiler will allow you to reference and will generate msil or you compile as in which case the world a note of despite my wording above and by in many it is not faster has the to be but it depends a lot more on the compiler will turn pretty much anything into reasonably efficient on the other is full of pitfalls that will make your code than the equivalent and the blog posts it references are worth a read for anyone curious about the performance of similar code written in the two is only one area where applications will be consistently and in startup a application may have to load the framework and jit the msil where a native just other than it is probably a mistake to assume that will be it because it gives you a bit more but that just means the compiler is less able to save you from the inefficiencies you create in your

probably looking at the tag wrapping option inside the text editor html options under the text editor you can either disable it altogether or extend it beyond the 80 character there is still some level of code reformatting that happens behind the scenes when you drag new controls into the page that i found any solution to other than just staying in the text editor as much as good things to vs2k8 does a much better job that vs2k5 when it comes to formatting with the new intellisense built into it makes it really easy to stay in the text editor while adding i think i do most of my html stuff there you can keep your display in and just refresh every now and then to see how your controls are coming

probably safe to just change the first line to foo flag tells that it apply any other rules after that the problem right now is that the second rule gets applied after the first and you end up at instead of difference between you trying to send to and the original redirect to is that the second rule applies to requests that do not include a so when the first rule was redirecting to after it was the second rule was no longer now that not redirecting to a location with a period in the second rule gets applied after the first so you get a you may be able to drop the flag from the first it depends on your site if someone accesses the site like do you want to send them to or just if you need the you can drop the and just foo	
probably start with the access exercise the queries in situ and see what the resultset often you can understand what the query accomplishes and then work back to your own design to accomplish be need to understand the intent pretty completely and that sounds like the best statement of requirements going to get like implemented than approach is the best i can think once they are in sql just start testing and

problem encountered with is that because by default you do a full test run a test or a suite of test for each mutation way to make mutation testing faster would be to stop the test run for a given mutant once a single failure has been encountered only during mutation even better would be for the mutation tester to remember what was the first test to kill the last and give that first to the next is there anything in ruby that does either of these or is my best bet to start monkey i know unit tests ought to be and showing all of the failed tests is useful outside of mutation as it helps you not merely identify that but pinpoint where going currently using heckle with if not possible for to remember which tests fail between maybe heckle or something running heckle could remember unit tests fail quickly for mutation

problem in have a big 2d point sparsely populated with of it as a big white canvas sprinkled with black have to iterate over and search through these dots a canvas can be bordering on the int and its size is unknown before setting points in brought me to the idea of need a hash function taking a 2d returning a unique that no collisions can can assume that the number on the canvas is easily countable by it is impossible to know the size of the canvas may even things like y sadly out of the also tried a very naive that produces too many hash function that provides keys with a low probability of ideas thanks for any had to change something in the question changed the assumption to count the number of points of the into to count the dots on the canvas the number of coordinate pairs to by original question make much because i would have had a sized which is uniquely a 16 bit shift and hope this is since all answers still make most sense with the updated for function providing unique uint from an integer coordinate

problem is that you are importing your app as if it lives directly on the python and your urlconf as if it lives within a module on the python this can only work if both and are both on the python path runserver does for you automatically to things though it ends up just delaying the confusion until deployment you can emulate behavior by using the following line in your apache probably makes more sense to standardize your references so your python path only need include one or the the usual way least the way i see referenced more would be to put on the python path and qualify your app as instead of just i take the opposite approach and it works just put on your python path and set to instead of the advantage of this is that if in future you want to make your app reusable and move it out of the particular your references to it tied to the project name with an app named it sound like thinking in terms of reusable apps

processor operates what is known as a machine code instructions are fairly they do all that much in a single for adding two numbers would have a sequence of instructions with semantics a pointer to the address of operand 1 into register the value stored at the address stored in register 1 into register a pointer to the address of operand 2 into register the value stored at the address in register 1 into register the contents of register 2 and register 3 and store it in register a pointer to the destination into register the contents of register 4 in the address specified in register the processor is a special set of fast memory known as a which contains the memory that the processor uses to store data that it is working on at the the register file has several which are uniquely instructions typically work on especially on risc while this is not always the case it is a good enough abstraction for the a processor has to load or store data into a register to do anything with operations such as arithmetic work on taking the operands from two registers and placing the result into a third the benefit of the peanut i used a 6502 lets not confuse the issue the processor has special instructions for loading or storing data from registers into the main processor has a special register called the that stores the address of the next operation to the sequence for executing an instruction goes roughly the instruction stored at the current address in the program the picking apart the actual what registers it the it works out where to get or store and some other bits and the the instruction will change the values in various for a instruction will copy a value into a an arithmetic or logical will take two values and compute a a jump or branch instruction will change the address at the program counter so the processor starts to fetch instructions from a different processor can have special an example of such is the program counter described another typical one is a condition flags this will have several bits with special for example it may have a flag that is set if the result of the last arithmetic operation was this is useful for conditional you can compare two if they are the flag is the processor can have a conditional instruction that is only executed if this flag is this you could decrement a counter in a register and if it was a condition flag is a conditional on can be used for a loop where you decrement a counter and exit the loop if the result of the decrement instruction is on some processors the arm all instructions are with a special condition for examples of typical processor instructions or decrement a or store the contents of a register into you can also have the address to load or store offset by the contents of another this allows you to easily loop over an array of data by incrementing the other logical operations to calculate these take operands from two registers and place the result in a to another location this moves the contents of the location into the program counter and starts to fetch instructions from the new or pop values onto a stackoverflow has an example of a small snippet of compiled c code and the assembly language output from that it should give you an example of the sort of relationship between a language and the machine code output that it compiles best way to learn this is to get an assembler and try it this used to be much easier on simpler computers like micros of the the closest thing to this type of architecture available these days are embedded you can get a development board for an embedded processor like a microchip pic fairly as this type of architecture has less baggage than a modern operating system there is less and to use system this will make it easier to bootstrap an assembly language program on this type of the simpler architecture is also easier to option is to get an emulator such as this will emulate a cpu and let you assemble and run programs on the advantage of such an emulator is that they will also have facilities for single stepping programs like a and showing the contents of the register this may be helpful in gaining insight as to actually going

put together a fairly lengthy answer to a similar entity decision making between orm since you asked i pick nhibernate for an web solution next version of the entity framework should be worth taking a long hard look the first version ready for large scale deployment and the generated leaves a lot to be but i see a big future if the adoef team can put it together it could be really especially if able to consume the revamped sql data brush up on esql and get used to the syntax for using linq to write data something tells me this will be excellent experience to have handy for the next few

quality begins with the language in languages are tools and have strengths and so any definition for code quality must consider in quality code exploits the strength of the language while exhibiting minimal dependence on its established we then can see that the skill of the coder is really what we are looking for in this means that money has no place in this some of the best code ever seen never made a it also means that the number of bugs in the code is not a good factor consider that code may work exactly as the requirements dictate thus making the bug an aspect of the requirements and not the code that flawlessly implements perfectly correct requirements can still be of low so correctness or lack of bugs can only be part of the leaves two other things to consider in making our ease of maintenance and performance when of maintenance is harder to but it has to do with the difficulty in reading and understanding the code of course brings in another the skill of the that might best be measured in it also has to do with the difficulty in changing the after code that is engineered well anticipates extensions to some so forethought in design that enables changes without whole scale restructuring makes for higher we all have faced the prospect of altering code significantly only to find that we are better off with a complete in execution is more than just it means writing code that is not as in setting values that remain unchanged within loops rather than outside the the comment above about efficient use of resources is very good as

question is more of an architectural less involved with the actual have build an api based on but really decide on how to separate the pl from the i have made my service so that it holds only a minimum of something tagitemresponse return of course the first question in what layer do the requestprocessors i think it would be wrong to call them a but at the same they have nothing to do with as for i decided that they nevertheless belong in the the processor methods take my as validate the request message authenticate and eventually return a single dto like override void tagitemresponse host var profile var item var tags new foreach name in var tag i ask why do i need the facade classes related to my business for example i have a hostfacade that acts as a layer between the hostdao and the holds very little it merely handles the dao static host return i might as well merge the processors and the read many on the but i still settle on the way to go and tend to chose a different approach every time i face the i wonder if a right approach even found the dofactory where they talked to the dao classes right from within the service i really like as most servicecontract methods share some and thus lend themselves well for use with shared base also found other examples where only the facades are called from within the but that seems to work well only for very my messages are and composite in order to reduce the number of calls to the service as much as my extra processing layer seems the be my real there is no single answer as to how to correctly layer a wcf but hopefully there are some of you out there with an opinion that will either conform my instincts or shed some new light on the subject for a wcf service the right way

question is very closely related to another question asked databases and databases address different not only in scale and but in the structure and usage of the as i understand it is about scalability that the architecture refers to a capability to increase capacity in a scalable the cloud is used frequently in reference to the where someone else takes care of the but an independent issue from the cloud you could operate your own set of servers in a cloud the justification for using the cloud architecture is that you have an application that has a variable need for computing so it would be overkill to have n servers dedicated to match your peak level of the cloud allows you to vary your usage of the servers as your level of activity grows over justification for using a saas model is that you want to be in the business of operating a data willing to relinquish some control and pay for the so that you can leave operation details to the experts in that they handle hardware 24x7 you handle your application and your

quiet new in ddd so hesitate to comment if you as you here to i understand why you should reference the infrastructure layer from your in my opinion the domain be dependent on the the domain objects should be completely ignorant on which database they are running on or which type of mail server is used to send by abstracting the domain from the infrastructure it is easier to because the domain know on which infrastructure its i do in my code is reference the domain layer from my infrastructure layer not the repositories know the domain objects because their role is to preserve state for the my repositories contains my basic crud operations for my root aggregates and are called from within my i did on my last project approach purely ddd but it worked pretty is that i abstracted my repositories with the root aggregates had to be instantiated by passing a concrete type of a root aggregate had to be instantiated through a repository by using the or a method of the the concrete repository constructing the object passed itself so that the aggregate could preserve his state and the state of his child objects but without knowing anything of the concrete implementation of the class public post post return public post existingpost class private ipostrepository internal public

quote difference between and interpreters is that the latter restate language features in terms of the features instead of actually implementing in other hence the they depend on their host environment to give the features one of the key features of a language that allows interpreters to be written for them is that that the primary representation of the program is a primitive datastructure of the language lisp exhibits this by virtue of the fact that programs are themselves expressed as

reading a question on difference between pointers and i decided that like to use references instead of pointers for my class however it seems that this is not because they cannot be declared uninitialized the particular scenario working on right i want to use normal variables the correct term for them by the because automatically initialized when i declare my bar1 is automatically instantiated with the default constructor what i causes a compiler error because you use uninitialized references and is happy as larry because pointers can be declared uninitialized the is it best practice to set this to bar bar bar looks like i have to use pointers in this is this the best way of using the the syntax is a bit tough what about is this attempting to implement a reference variable field in my class and initializing it in the why might i receive the following in constructor uninitialized reference member the real also tried doing this in the but no luck get the same there is a default i neglected it because i thought it relevant to the problem foolish of after removing the default constructor i caused a compiler error because the class is used with a which requires there to be a default so it looks like i must use a default and therefore must use a or is i use pointers for my class

reading some of your responses i was thinking that general problem with the described metric is that it negative reporting bugs it encourage producing good quality is and have the same trouble with any other metric you the key issue is that quality is not something we know how to measure you really care about the question of code quality primarily if doing your job your real question should is this person helping us make is not something you can do with but it is something you have to try to the best advice i can give you is that your managers simply have to work with the programmers and understand what the programmers are another important source of information comes from a peers who work with them day in and day since we have a numerical way to measure you will to some degree or another have to rely on the softer science to get insight into how well your programmers are

reads the file in the current line of the file is stored in basically the same as technically it expands to but very close to the same thing either so you need to worry about with no arguments is equivalent to it splits the current line into a list of items between so it splits the current line into a list of words or and stores this list in an this line is should be qualified with perl would catch this if you have and at the push pushes a reference to an anonymous array containing the elements that were in into which is an array of arrays you probably already in the you have a list where each element in the list corresponds to a line of the and each element of the list is another list of the words on that should be declared using and you should and in as has been you could do away with push using a temporary array may be nicer on anyone who has to add to this code i missed the regex you wanted to last unless push catch all integers it match if you want it to match negative use if you want to match you could use but i know if you want to match these regexes will match invalid entries like and which are not integers or if you want to be more strict about try my this line for floating last loop unless this line for just last loop unless push	
real question is why you need this to not be if it should not be cached because it changes all the the server should specify to not cache the if it just changes sometimes one of the resources it depends on can and if the client code has a way of knowing about it can append a dummy parameter to the url that is computed from some hash or last modified date of those resources what we do in microsoft ajax script resources so they can be cached forever but new versions can still be served as they if the client know of the correct way should be for the server to handle head requests properly and tell the client whether to use the cached version or to me like appending a random parameter or telling from the client to never cache is wrong because cacheability is a property of the server and so should be decided question to ask oneself is should this resource really be served through get or should it go through that is a question of but it also has security implications are attacks that work only if the server allows for post will not get	
real thing to consider is what your program does with the relational databases are designed to handle complex relationships between sets of not designed to perform complex the amount of data and relative simplicity of it suggests to me that you could simply use a flat file to store the coordinates and read them into memory when this way you can design your data structures to more closely reflect how going to be using this rather than how going to store languages provide a mechanism to write data structures to a file and read them back in again called is one such and sure you can find one for whatever language you just design your classes or data structures as dictated by how used by your program and use one of these serialization libraries to populate the instances of that class or data the requirement that the structures be mutable really affect much with regard to my answer i still think that serialization and deserialization is the best solution to this the fact that users need to be able to modify and save the structures necessitates a bit of planning to ensure that the files are updated completely and but ultimately i think end up spending less time and effort with this approach than trying to marshall sqlite or another embedded database into doing this job for only case in which a database would be better is if you have a system where multiple users are interacting with and updating a central data and for a case like that be looking at a database server like or sql server for both speed and also commented that going to be using as your has support for serialization so you should be to

really like the concept of modular bundles as implemented by also like services like google appengine web or java webstart client two ideas seem to complement rather well the osgi standard includes a couple of features that make it impossible for implementations like felix or equinox to run on top of sandboxed virtual such as appengine or in these it is not possible to get direct access to a file for which precludes the osgi bundle cache that is used to store persistent bundle state and native i have no great interest in using native libraries or have persistent bundle is there some framework that implements the core bundle and services concept of osgi in a compatible way so that osgi bundles can be deployed into it as but can work without a bundle cache other facilities not available in a am looking for something like a limited version of felix that works on appengine or if the webstart engine and the google appengine just provided osgi framework services that would be another very limiting aspect of appengine is that you cannot start new this prevents other asynchronous bundle obviously not an issue with that can run in a sandbox appengine or

really think your code is being executed by a as you use those with which your question implies you are please add so tags to indicate say that it read environment but that the calling application in the same can create this seem likely in the code do you want to read the environment variable what do you want to with a quick i suggest having the wrapping code write the environment variable values out to a file and then read if you really want a c or you will have to clarify your please note that stackoverflow is a site for answering programming questions it is not a site to provide you with free if the problem is as easy as you say it is requires a c something i am still not convinced hire a c programmer for half a day to write	
really up to you to the performance considerations already since virtualizing to compartmentalize going to come down to what you you want easier put the data on the same vm as the that use you want more granular put the data in a separate or a separate vhd on the same and back those up differently to the application you want to learn about or you expect remote clients to want access to the data with little configuration change on your put the data on the network that great thing about virtualization is that you could try it each way and see which you like

reason is that databases are about and objects are about structures and once you take the data and embed it in you characterize the relationships and operations in a static on the other are about unstructuring the data into a bunch of instances of atomic tables that can be reassembled into different structures with without disturbing the integrity of the are somewhat analogous to

reason why i asked this question initially was my concern that rapi was going to be too involved for my little app looking at the api i started out writing a wrapper library in unmanaged code only to realize that i would have to carry the entire runtime environment so i ended up cobbling together a few methods for rapi file handling and file system operations that call rapi directly from using i found a few of these methods in various added some more of my and put them all in a i fitted them with consistent error and it turned out to do exactly what i after only a few hours of

reasonable implementer would just use a bitmap internally in the and draw to that using os native drawing does it not at all related to if what for the html parser sees a canvas element a given width it needs to allocate an onscreen pixmap to cover that it either does this manually or it calls into some os native drawing api to create a surface to draw the os native api could be or any other drawing library that the implementer of the browser highly dependent on the operating internet explorer probably calls into some windows native library directx or the drawing surface is made accessible to the internal guts of the javascript likely via a pointer or handle to the constructed drawing when the js interpreter sees an invocation of one of the canvas it turns this into a call to the appropriate os native using the windows style using a manually managed height it matter to the javascript developer how these methods are the only people who need to care are the ones who are writing html5 compliant web browsers with canvas

recently did some work modifying a python gui app that was using wxpython experimented with python in fits and starts over last six or seven but this was the first time i did any work with a i was pretty disappointed at what seems to be the current state of gui programming with i like the python language itself a a fun change from the programming used definitely a big productivity increase for general purpose programming like to move to python for wxpython is a huge step backwards from something like vcl or while python itself offers nice productivity gains from generally programming a higher level of wxpython is used at a way lower level of abstraction than the for i wasted a lot fo time trying to get a wxpython list object to behave the way i wanted it just to add sortable columns involved several one to create and maintain a that provided the actual sort another to make it possible to show in the column and there were a couple more i all of these error prone steps could be accomplished simply by setting a property value using my delphi grid while python provides big productivity gains by raising level of abstraction for a lot of general purpose wxpython is several levels of abstraction than the gui tools available for net gui programming with delphi is way faster than gui programming with and the resulting ui with delphi is still more polished and it seem to me like exaggerating to say that delphi gui programming was more advanced back in 1995 than python gui programming with wxpython is in did some investigating of other python gui frameworks and it look like any were substantially better than i also did some minimal investigation of gui formbuilders for which would have made things a little bit but by most reports those solutions are buggy and even a great formbuilder address my main complaints about which are simply that it has fewer features and generally requires you to do gui programming at a much lower level of abstraction than used to with some quick investigating into suggested python solutions is honestly somewhat depressing for someone used to delphi or got a couple of am i missing is there some solution for python that can compare with vcl or winforms i necessarily care if it quite measure up to just looking for something in the same could ironpython be the direction to mostly tried to avoid drinking the but maybe ironpython gives me a reason to finally give even does ironpython fully integrate with or would i need to have the forms themselves be backed by or it looks to me like that definitely is the case with sharpdevelop and monodevelop ironpython be used to do gui does fully integrate ironpython with really seems to me like python could over the in a way similar to the way that visual basic did back in the early if some wonderful new solution came out for only this time with python have a whole new paradigm of cross and gui corporations eat that i web apps are the main focus of things these so a great solution create same revolution that vb once but i see gui programming disappearing and like a nice open high level current state of gui programming with	
recently going with their open company however after reading through i am not sure if this model is really way i understand is that they open up the source and depending on how much the contribute get badges at and are compensated accordingly from the revenue here are the releasing the source will be made a so that users can study and modify application for their own they want to contribute their they can submit them for to discourage a tiny essential core containing licensing will be kept least until users reach a this will gradually followed by a similar opening of rest of the company bug building the trust basic infrastructure will be up so that participants can rating each the algorithms code will be released as open so that they can be studied discussed used by will probably need quite some time tweaking before we reach a compensating income in the company operating will be through the trust metric distributed to company still keeps some bits private to retain control and that make it truly how is that any different from hiring developers and compensating them with stock options and david brown points out the the addition of the extra means that the license can no longer termed an open source it ideal for the open it essentially an issue of mutual if i fully respect your will in return respect my right to a and open source model really

recommend looking at this from a purely usability how are your users supposed to work while filling in most of the doing validation on both the control and the form level is what of there are many user interaction styles you can the users do what they and then check on their results on this can be excellent for expert allowing them to input things quickly and but leaves newbies and infrequent users rather at a each control as entered or on this can be especially for complex forms of course we but done poorly can prevent people from filling in forms incrementally in their own i prefer a visual indication that amiss if i do it impossible to enter anything this can be achieved through sliders for combo boxes for restricted edit boxes which prevent bad even in case there are some cases where you have to check whether combinations of values are worked with some cases where the values in some subsets of controls are dependent on each other by an not always feasible or worth the effort to provide the user with immediate feedback in these so a case can always be made for validating on agree with binary worrier that the ok check is the main if sure it should never be sure to log a warning if it and sniff such events through your support channels if but make the end user pay for programming

recommendation to start with xsd is a good that will not guarantee compatibility on each as xml schema is really big and no web services stack supports all of start with but confine yourself to mainstream complextypes composed of arrays of you can safely nest complextypes and of complextypes that contain arrays or away from substitution and any other xsd even xsd enumerations should be not enough to use a nullable there are formatting concerns as the datetime is a higher resolution quantity than a java calendar and as a shipping a time to java can result in exceptions on the java using the decorator in the xmlelement attribute on the side can make sure you serialize old on it is not true that you cannot use xml doc on the classes that get with partial you can write separate code from the generated classes with the doc you even if you the your partial class code will remain when you the doc will appear on the someone if using is not enough to guarantee why use my it is not a guarantee but it is a good it it keeps you away from designing interfaces in code java or or that expose things like generic java all of which present interop there are still pitfalls in the more marginal parts of but you can usually avoid those with thoughtful should have mentioned in my original answer that you can apply an iterative process to the development of the design in then generate stub and skeleton code from the then adjust and do it

refactoring the way the client code for a web service is the existing build creates the java client code by using a deployment of the web service on jboss and executing the axis 2 antcodegentask against this method fails if the development server is down or has outdated control fails whenever the wsdl need to build the client code against the web service class itself instead of having to point to a deployment of the web i use java2wsdl to generate wsdl from the web service class and then use the same antcodegentask to generate the client problem is that wsdl created by java2wsdl is different than what jboss displays in among other some of the namespaces are different and the antcodegentask step convert these namespaces into the correct package got to get the final package structure to be what the client code the existing antcodegentask uses to accomplish but when i execute the same antcodegentask to the wsdl generated by java2wsdl it convert the namespaces to the package would axis show different wsdl when the web service is deployed in jboss than it generates from there a way to use axis to create the client code from the web service class without generating the intermediate documentation for the java2wsdl and wsdl2java ant tasks is a little bit axis 2 v gives ant tasks for antcodegentask and 2 java2wsdltasks in different the axis 2 installation includes binaries for wsdl2java and but no codegen maybe antcodegentask is the same as anyone got something like this to work with axis 2 java2wsdl creates different wsdl than jboss shows in the

reference is not a it may be implemented as a pointer in the but its core concept is not equivalent to a a reference should be looked at like it the object it is referring therefore you cannot change and it cannot be pointer is simply a variable that holds a memory pointer itself has a memory address of its and inside that memory address it holds another memory that it is said to point reference is not the it does not have an address of its and hence it cannot be changed to another think the faq on says it even though reference is often implemented an address in the underlying please do not think of reference as a funny looking to an a reference is it is not a pointer to nor a copy of the is the again in a once a reference bound to an it can not to another reference itself an object has no taking the address a reference gives you the address the the is its

references have two always point to the same can not be are the can point to different can be is there no reseatable reference or in i think of a good reason why references be question comes up often because i usually use references when i want to make sure that an avoiding the words or is never think i ever thought that this ref always refers to the same if references were one could still get the current behavior like i const j is already legal but restate my question like was the rationale behind the reference the why was it considered useful to have references be the same instead of only when declared as are references not reseatable in	
refers to the fact when types are considered equivalent by what methods them not based on their declared to take a concrete many methods in ruby take a object to operate on a this means that the object has to implement enough functions to be able to pass as an io type object has to sound enough like a the end it means that you have to write less code than in java to do the same everything is not great about dynamic you more or less give up all of the typechecking that java other typed gives ruby simply has no idea if about to pass the wrong object to a that will give you a runtime it give you a runtime error until the code is actually

relies on the fact that a hash is a one way in other its very easy to convert a password into a but very difficult to do the when a user registers you convert their chosen password into a hash and store at a later point they login using their password and you convert the password to its hash and compares it this is to a high level of probablity if then is a solution to a related if you know that someones passwordhash say then you can try calcuolating hashes for all possible sooner or later you may find that so you know their this takes a very long but the process can be speeded up by using for a given hash you can look up the corresponding however means that the text that is hashed isnt a simple english or a simple for the case i gave the text that would be hashed is not but is this means that any readily available dictionary is since the likelyhood of it containing the hash for that text is a lot less than the likelihood of it containing the hash for this likelihood becomes even lower if the salt is a random alphanumeric

requires minimal file which i believe is the main cause of problems when using this kind of shared resource over a network file the reason it can get away with this is that most of the files in a git all the ones that form the object are named as a digest of their and immutable once so there the problem of two clients trying to use the same file for different content come other part of the object database is the refs are stored in files under the directory in and these do although the files are small and always rewritten rather than being in this git writes the new ref to a temporary file and then renames it over the target if the filesystem respects even if the worst that could happen would be a race overwriting a ref although this would be annoying to it should not cause corruption as it just might be the case that you push to the shared and that push looks like it succeeded whereas in fact someone but this could be sorted out simply by pulling in the other and pushing i think that repo corruption is too much of a problem true that things can go a bit wrong due to locking but the design of the git repo will minimise the this all sounds good in but not done any concurrent hammering of a repo to test it and only share them over nfs not

see you have several options and a couple of decisions to could think about driven you could use trac to support communication rather that tickets and early a list of the features to be developed and state that the version happens when all the features are developed and make umbrella tickets for all there are and will define development define a couple of milestones based on the amount of features planned and the first milestone should contain at least one since the goal of a milestone is get the project built for testing and define one or more milestones to mark when all features are call them or during development there is a need to be shy in making and make the umbrella tasks dependent on these newer bug report need to be under any of and can have as much detail as these are these will define development one exception is a bug squashing sprint to eliminate publish the names of the developers with more assigned and not solved bugs to compel them to solve the of the process of making a a beta or a release candidate is tag the source to make the process and be able to spot bugs even when the trunk source has already on the usual way to tag consists of copying the trunk source to a directory on and make sure nobody commits into that believe a two number version number is enough for most the first number denote compatibility and the the but there are several variables that can be inside a version source binary bugfix companion product version protocol

seem like the approach your looking but what i i 2 i think if you have an odd number of characters the substring will probably probably have to add a check and use something like 2 0 2 but i to me the difficulty here is that your reduce actually depends on the array index rather than the hence my solution of enumerating the array indexes and working from another solution would be to provide a method think of one built that enumerates the characters in the string using a tuple that contains the index and the

seem to have recieved a lot of answers for your first but at a casual glance none for your when should i not use the inherited keyword in overridden the answer is when you dont wish the inherited method to be careful though as not allowing an inherited method to run may break functionality of an inherited object in a undesirable way so make sure you are not introducing any unintended side an imagine you wish to fully override an inherited function called applydiscount but someone has hardcoded the discount percentage into the ancestor if you call the inherited applydiscount it will override your code or calculate a value you will then in this case you could just not call inherited and apply the discount is a contrived example so if someone can think of a better one please add

seen compilers that emit any if no function at all exists defined in one implementation file instead of a header they would throw errors like or something and you would be confused as as i not conformant with the but it happens so consider putting at least one virtual function not in the header only the virtual so that the compiler could emit a vtable for the class at that i know it happens with some versions of someone inline virtual functions can be a benefit but of course most often you will use it when you do know the dynamic type of the because that was the whole reason for in the first compiler however completely ignore it has other semantics apart from speeding up a the for definitions is the mechanism which allows you to put the definition into the only functions can be defined multiple times throughout the whole program without a violation any in the it behaves as you would have defined it only once in the whole even though you included the header multiple times into different files linked

seen several here about the best way to handle and persist values data suited for to persist an enum using and like to ask what the general consenus tried to summarize my marking this community wiki in the hope of getting a sort of expert consensus so here it the the enums should be handled using either the native enum type least in java and or using something like the enum using plain constants or is as you lose type safety make it hard to understand which values are legal input for a choice between these two depends on how much additional functionality is to be attached to the you want to put loads of functionality into the enum is because you avoid on it all the a class is usually more the other for simple the enum is usually at least in java an enum cannot inherit from another so if you have several enums with similar behavior which like to put into a you cannot use persist each enum value should be assigned a unique this can be either an or a short a short string is since it can be mnemonic it easier for dbas to understand the raw data in the the every enum should then have mapping functions to convert between the enum use inside the and the id value some frameworks have limited suppport for doing this you have to put it into the enum database should contain a table for each enum listing the legal one column would be the which is the additional columns might make sense for a all table columns that will contain values from that enum can then use this as a this guarantees that incorrect enum values can never be and allows the db to on its problem with this approach is that the list of legal enum values exists in two places and this is hard to avoid and therefore often considered but there are two keep the list of values in the generate the enum type at build but means that a db connection is required for a build to which seems the list of values in the code to be check against the values in the db at runtime at on practices for using and persisting

short answer is that will remove a file from the will remove a module from the cache of previously loaded modules that the current python interpreter is when you import a the interpreter checks to see if there is a file of the same name as the file you are trying to if there and if the file has not changed since the file has been then python will load the file is significantly the file does not or the file has been changed since the file was then the file is loaded and a new file is is worth noting that simply running a python say will cause a to be only modules causes this to is another matter in order to speed up code which imports the same module python maintains a list of the modules that have been imported during the current interpreter if the module being imported is in then the cached version will be read nor files will be checked for on the python provides a builtin function which allows you to bypass the module cache and force a reload from get more information on module see the docs on

should not be mocking the ientryrepository since the implementing class is the class under you want to mock the and inject then just test that the methods that you invoke via your public interface are called this would just be an alternative to the way you have it implemented and necessarily better unless you want the class to have backing class injected in which case writing the tests that way would force that might want some more tests to make sure that when you insert an the right entry is likewise with delete insert a couple of then delete one and make sure that the proper one has been once you come up with tests to get the code to do what you want it keep thinking of ways that you could mess up writing the code and write tests to make sure those granted this class is pretty simple and you may be able to convince yourself that the tests you have that drive behavior is it take much to make it worth testing edge cases and unexpected

shuffle is the best you can do for random numbers in a specific range with no the reason that the method you describe generate numbers and put them in a set until you reach a specified is less efficient is because of that algorithm might never at best it will finish in an indeterminable amount of as compared to a which will always run in a highly predictable amount of to edits and as you indicate in the the range of numbers is very large and you want to select relatively few of them at random with no then the likelihood of repeats diminishes the bigger the difference in size between the range and the number of the smaller the likelihood of repeat and the better the performance will be for the algorithm you describe in the the the

silverlight runtime have support for avi files natively so you be able to use those with the you would need to do is actually parse the avi file by hand and pull out frames from that once you get to the point where you are parsing it potentially gets a little you plan on having this work on silverlight your avi file would need to contain wmv frames or frames in one of supported image or if you were working with i would set up a mediastreamsource and pass in the desired video frame to the mediastreamsource as my first if you are working with one of the image formats you should use image and set its source to a you can see an example where joe stegman has used this to help silverlight 2 support you were doing this in silverlight 3 in beta right the techniques are generally the same but the media format support grows a bit to include addition to raw or raw argb similarly on the imaging you now have the writeablebitmap which you could use to draw your your video is something like you would need to find a way to decode that frame so you could display it in

simply find nant easier to i dare say this is partly due to my background in but i found building a nant file for protocol buffers to be a simpler job than building an msbuild file for now there are things in the miscutil build which like to include but it seems ridiculously hard to dump the output of a task to a text the concepts are and there seem to be fewer gotchas in terms of when file collections are evaluated currently like using a setup which i previously thought was really silly i use nant for my build but invoke msbuild to do the actual my the idea of having two build systems for the same project is but i basically treat the msbuild part as a full build system just an easy way of and i never need to manually examine the project only interact with it via visual been able to evolve my protocol buffers build very easily this and i doubt have had the same experience if used going to try building it all with mono is released until then there are showstoppers in at which point see how portable the strategy

since event driven frameworks are similar to the reactor which stipulates a main loop which waits for events and then invokes the registered callbacks for the various is how frameworks have been traditionally a nice description about how erlang processes are tied to the event processes are tightly integrated with the erlang network io processes can sockets and send and receive messages this provides the elegance of programming plus the scalability of io erlang vm uses under the some interesting notes that were very influential on me at the note in particular how locks and callbacks interact

snapshots an audit trail is a common database for many creating or audit tables is an easy and straight forward while database level backups and transaction logs are good to they are not a version control you need create a shadow table with all the same columns as the base and then setup triggers on the base table to place a copy of the row in the shadow table when ever it is updated or some logic you can recreate what the data looked like at a given point in for an easy way to set this up in sybase you need to do lots of historical then you can keep the data in the same create two columns an added and deleted the downside is for every query you must add a where of course you can create a which shows just the active this gets a bit more complicated if you have a normalized database with multiple all with it does you simply have the and columns on each and then your query has the point in time of whenever data is modified you must copy the current and mark it as	
so after further i figured out that it is not a but it kinda is i gave you credit even though partially it after act like i thought it should which is to say it the logical flow is something like for a namespace in the that matches one in the namespaces look for a controller of the right if return if not return search everywhere else that normally not search everywhere in my thought that the namespaces array would serve to disambiguate was the reason my first test in that regard failed is that it only does a perfect and i made the mistake of using just the root from the assembly other myroot instead of this namespaces thing is to have a homecontroller in two different namespaces and match them differently depending on the url or

so i have to build a web app in id much much much prefer because its more modern and makes more sense to i know mvc and have come from a rails so this webforms stuff looks kinda gross to me i need an tree one that loads the subtrees via ajax when nodes are asp mvc i would do something like making a partial representing a single and a jquery ajax triggered controller action that renders a collection of these which is inserted into the children in my options a webforms control that represents a single use asp ajax to call a codebehind method that recursivley adds controls representing the children of this fits well within the offical asp pretty webforms are and makes upgrading this site to later much a webservices method that returns the children as a json which are then formatted to html in using jquery for the requesting and speedy due to low overheads with more as easily transition to mvc controller more work to html ends up mixed up in with the clientside theres no templating which is a third party web least best have to evalutate which one to may have to with control other what do you guys think is the best way to ajax

so much an answer as a clarification of the i think your factory is complicating things somewhat that you get a stack overflow exception versus not being able to compile at problem is a circular you cannot instantiate a without an instance of and you cannot instantiate an instance of b without an instance of class company private iclient ok so first build a client and pass it public class client private icompany ok so first build a company and pass it i public has an article about this which may be of some your class design is the problem and it needs the factory is just confusing the issue

solution depends on the gameplay going if the gameplay is the anim is driven by the if the anim length determines how long the in that latter is typically more flexible in a commercial production environment as the designer can just say need that death anim to be and it gets but when you have very precise rules in mind or a simulated system like animation may be there is no orthogonal and clean solution for the general thing that helps to keep it from getting messy is to consider game ai ai is typically implemented as some form of finite state possibly multiple state machines or layered in some most common division being a high level scripting format with low level the low level you can say things like the hitreact playback my hitreact anim until it then find out from the logic what state to continue at the high level there are a multitude of ways to go about defining the but simple repeating loops like are a good way to helps to keep the two kinds of behaviors the planned and the reactions to new events from being too it always work out that way in for the same reasons that sometimes you want code to drive data or the other way but ai for no general solutions	
solution is generally but has a few update you have to shut down and have some otehr app update you to prevent the this is usually handled by having a dedicated app that you it might be the target of the app icon and therefore does updates with every or it may be launched via a for type of menu you have to launch it and make sure the actual app generally a good idea to provide some form of in the event of a interrupted updates are going to require wholesale updates of this may not be what you want in the end may want to update just a single assembly or so starting with the logic of pulling down individual files is going to make you way more but still very resource is alex article on creating

sources of advice are correct when they say it is the domain in many it will be quite closely aligned your data model as the domain and data models differ is that the data model is relatively static in form whereas your domain model adds the specific constraints and rules of your for in my data model i represent blood pressure as smallints and in my i have a pressure object that holds values for each of the two readings and that also imposes additional restrictions on the range of acceptable values the range for systolic is much smaller than that for it also adds qualitative judgments on these values bp of is addition of these aspects of the problem domain is what makes the domain model more than just the data in some domains those that would be better rendered with a fully data model and that map poorly on the relational find that the two diverge quite all the systems created feature a very high degree of i often push a fair number of domain constraints into the data model itself via stored

stack alignment is when variables are placed on the stack to a particular number of so if you are using a 16 bit stack each variable on the stack is going to start from a byte that is a multiple of 2 bytes from the current stack pointer within a means that if you use a variable that is 2 such as a char there will be 8 bits of unused between it and the next this allows certain optimisations with assumptions based on variable calling one method of passing arguments to the next function is to place them on the stack opposed to placing them directly into whether or not alignment is being used here is as the calling function places the variables on the to be read off by the calling function using if the calling function aligns the and the called function expects them to be then the called function be able to find seems that the msvc compiled code is disagreeing about variable try compiling with all optimisations turned

start with seeing as the simplest as that can be repeatedly called without but when called will return a value and then suspend their when called they will start up from where they last suspended execution and do their thing generator is essentially a cut down the difference between a coroutine and generator is that a coroutine can accept arguments after been initially whereas a generator a bit difficult to some up with a trivial example of where use but my best take this python code as an while do some funky yield do some more funky the coroutine does some funky stuff to and returns a new x print example of where coroutines are used is lexers and without coroutines in the language or emulated lexing and parsing code needs to be mixed together even though really two separate but using a you can separate out the lexing and parsing going to brush over the difference between symmetric and asymmetric suffice it to say that you can convert from one to the and asymmetric are the most like the easier to i was outlining how one might implement asymmetric coroutines in are actually quite simple all they are functions representing another point in the program if you call will cause execution to automatically switch to the point that function you use very restricted versions of them every day without even realising for can be thought of as a kind of give you a python based pseudocode example of a python had a function called and this function took two the first being a and the second being a list of arguments to call it the only restriction on that function would be that the last argument it takes will be a function will be our current would happen is that would in turn call with the current continuation that a reference to the point in the program at which was when calls the current essentially the same as telling to return with the value calling the current continuation and when it does it rolls back the stack to where the current continuation was when you called result of all of this would be that our hypothetical python variant would print hope that and sure my explanation can be improved on quite a

step by step think first you must have is msdn either from msdn library offline or msdn library since i have limited bandwidth in i choose offline there are documentations about and many some samples i have to download from the have to know the i think it is basic for all software development oop especially in today programming in you will see like multiple in you have generics especially if you want to play at least with basic syntax and make it some hello world program in desktop and basic input output is like one input and in advanced like implement event modified your hello world program so you can use with simple application like todo list in and this simple to do list just enter data from input and make a list what to the application using database to store and retrieve in here you will learn design you will see that base class library in using design this is good for designing using asynchronous principle like multi multi processing or others concept like locking and io and networking it is good since most development will use like handle copy file or connecting to other to make configuration using config file or other security concept in windows and you can see in microsoft knowledge base and to get a certification on test from test provider in your city and get mcp this is good for you

strongly disagree with the answer provided by the whole point of scrum is to get rid of the method where designers first their and then go on to other completely and against all lean scrum way to incorporate designers in a scrum throw into the make sure not just wrapping a waterfall project into scrum as the best way towards scrum only works when implemented without is the worst project organize work so that possible for concurrent designing and overdo initial but make it a where both sides of the coin influence the the point of scrum is to iterate and so take full benefit from pretty lean to actually shun traditional design you can read more about this from this excellent blog post in signal

suspect a risk of premature optimization be careful about your your approach is a property of right angle is that what you actually assuming your points are and so for the general case you have them implicitly representing two vectors form the origin these v1 so your angle is where is vector this faster the will depend on a lot of do you know the vector or have to compute how fast can you do a dot product in your how fast is at some point tricks like table lookup might help but that will cost you all there really a general answer to your added like to that often playing is is a bit of a mugs game with modern cpus and compilers you know until you measure it and grovel the generated when you hit the point that you really care about it at this level for a piece of you can find out in detail what your system is but maybe a table is but maybe got fast vector computations and a small it all amounts to sorry on the other if you reached the point that you really care so much about this bit of you probably be thinking about it at this level at make it make it clean means abstraction as well as then worry about the

suspect the difference is a conversion from an floating point value to a long vs a conversion from an floating point value to a one and a conversion to a reason for 80 bits coming up at all is that a typical precision used for actual and the width of floating point the result is something like the conversion from that to a long yields the nearest floating point value to the value is actually so the conversion ends up yielding to give this a bit more a java program which uses arithmetic to do the same note that it converts the double value closest to into a bigdecimal that value is other the exact result of the calculation is 11 class public static void bigdecimal c new bigdecimal a new bigdecimal b new bigdecimal result the other correct to about 40 decimal digits more than either 64 or 80 bit floating point can consider what this number looks like in i have any tools to easily do the but again we can use java to assuming a normalised the part ends up using three bits less than for eleven that leaves 60 bits of mantissa for extended precision and 48 bits for double precision the closest number to 11 in each use class public static void bigdecimal half new bigdecimal eleven new the three numbers got work out the closest value to the correct one for each precision for extended less than round each of those values to a and you end up with 10 and 11 this is enough evidence to convince the doubters

taking advantage of short since js uses you can do a bunch of actions within a function and have it remain in that this is useful for invoking code that mess with the global it also allows one to make private variables if you declare a variable inside of an anonymous function and execute it only other code inside of the anonymous function can access that suppose i want to make a global unique id one might do code like counter genid counter counter return now anyone can mess with and now polluted the global namespace with two variables and i could use a anonymous function to generate my counter genid var counter var genidimpl counter counter return return i only have one variable in the global which is more the counter variable is now safe from being modified it only exists in the anonymous and so only the function genidimpl was defined in the same can access looks like in example they just want to execute code that pollute the global namespace at

tend to think that keeping with the latest version is a good that mean upgrading as soon as the product is released but within a relatively short timeframe afterwards can be for application java found that vendors generally provide a reasonably straightforward upgrade path from version to version and upgrading becomes more problematic if the upgrade must skip a few versions framework an application is working well in production without any problems i can understand the desire not to change anything and avoid the overhead of regression with more widespread adoption of automated unit if a new version offers significant benefits in terms of performance features is it worth found in my experience that products are not usually kept and when the particular version of the product is no longer supported the task of upgrading to the latest version tends to be quite time consuming and question it a good idea to keep with the latest version of major system components such as operating application we have oracle application server which is certified to use up to java sdk the latest version of java is now is currently in the and oracle application server is up to is certified for sdk upgrading to sdk it opens up the possibility for new applications being developed to use existing infrastructure to use more current versions of supporting frameworks such as hibernate or ibatis as well as later standards for these upgrades are not done the new application being developed is limited to using old versions and consequently will add to the time and cost of future upgrade or not to

that and paste is not actually despite the the act of is figuring out how something should and what code is needed to make that when you copy and paste some it is someone else who did the this a bad thing as you always need to write code but to call yourself a you do need to have written the code will want to start try to write a large complex application as your first step into there is a good reason why most people who are taught programming are first taught how to print this is because there is a lot more that you will need to know than just what code to use you need to know where code execution starts and how it and that sort of you need to be able to look at the code and step through it knowing where program execution will go so you understand how it will a tutorial or course in there is so much free stuff do not trust any tutorial that just gives you large chunks of make sure it forces you to actually come up with some code do exercises such as sorting calculating fibonacci and the and or the learn about conditional statements and the loop and play with these to do various or forms programming is more make sure you know the fundamentals of the language before you go looking through any api or framework documentation to see what the language can need to know how execution how to write what types of variables you can use etc before you can effectively use an api or framework it is boring not being able to do cool graphics or forms and sticking to basic text or number but you have to walk before make sure you are not just when you learn about something new like the array the try it by actually doing a lot faster than just reading a book or website and you may be more likely to remember books about some people say you should learn c before you learn anything i necessarily but if you do learn c then the book to read is c programming by kernighan and many programming books are very interesting but either not suitable for or going to teach you how to actually begin this one is an a decent text editor with syntax highlighting and line all you should a big ide that also does code completion and the like is not necessarily helpful at the learning spend too long choosing one or setting it if you already have just get on and be done with if you like it you can change it once you get more or if already paid for microsoft visual studio then use but go out and get it just for the sake of learning a avoid falling into the trap of spending all your time sharpening your tools and no time using

that there are two different performance and you stated which you are throughput and writing a gui the ui needs to be you care how many clicks per second you can but you do care about showing some response within a 10th of a second or so this is one of the reasons best to have a single thread devoted to handling the gui reasons have been mentioned in other the gui thread needs to basically convert windows messages into and let your worker queue handle the heavy once the worker is it notifies the gui which then updates the display to reflect any it does things like painting a but not rendering the data to be this gives the app a quick that is what most users want when they talk about they care if it takes 15 seconds to do something as long as when they click on a button or a it reacts other performance characteristic is this is the number of jobs you can process in a specific amount of usually this type of performance tuning is only needed on server type or other this measures how many webpages can be served up in an or how long it takes to render a for these sort of you want to have 1 active thread per fewer than and going to be wasting idle clock more than and the threads will be competing for cpu time and tripping over each take a look at the second graph in this article for the dealing note that the ideal thread count is higher than the number of available cpus due to things like blocking and the key is the number of

the best advice as every other poster on this topic has to write often been in the situation where this is if the code is that line embedded and undocumented magic code also likely to have another which is that deeply coupled and components are almost impossible to isolate a codebase that loads and hundreds of different database objects on components assume random parts of the cache and parts of the cache assume other parts of the cache you have to load the whole thing to get code dependant on and promiscuously state where impossible to determine setting those or even what they suggestions i can come up to fix the things hardcoded magic number obvious code perhaps a quick release that gets rid of the worst of the violations will be of low risk and make the next steps easier to organizational support for refarctoring often no will or desire to do work that add immediate and risks breaking existing there of great arguments for but not everybody buys if the organization support it you may have to give it other developers around to the same view if any probably as unhappy with the codebase as you if new code is built to better standards and people are start to fix older code as tweaks need to be a particular subsystem is really bad and has reached the point where new development is nearly impossible you can probably use this opportunity to rebuild	
the best approach for injecting dependencies if spring or guice are not your library was written in a it should be fairly easy to use as a straitforward java think of your past experience with there are several libraries out there that fit perfectly with the spring model but were written before spring i see nothing bad with a followed by a couple of followed by a call to the just be extra among other your client can forget to call thouse methods that spring reliably i consider something like a factory method to instantiate and wire the the dependencies are all inside the so it seem appropriate to have the application instantiate each dependency to create the main the client application decide you are providing a let the api client wire its own provide an that same example can be used to make the factory method on the maybe the client application has own way to configure and it would be desirable if the api your library provides to be flexible enough to take advantage of maybe you can include the licence is just like a whole piece of java

the fact that it seems to be a bug in one of the erlang libs i think you could easily circumvent the the fact your file is i think best practice is that you process it as the following it works nicely on an unpatched erlang and because it uses lazy evaluation it can handle files of arbitrary length without having to read all of it into memory the module contains an example of a function to apply to each line turning a line of of integers into a list of applies a function to all lines of the before reducing reads the lines of a file in a lazy this one does the lazy read case eof l take a line of space separated integers and them into a list of with as a you can easily fold over the lines of any file running out of memory 73 52 40 26 53 06 10 51 87 86 61 95 66 57 25 90 81 80 38 92 67 30 28 51 76 81 18 75

the issue was caused by incorrect use of as sure the following example is pretty much pseudo so wont added a 3rd solution thanks to wrong way stack mytype1 mytype1 mt1 this actually does print so the memory is being because using stack memory this value is when we go back to thread mytype1 mt1 this will actually print out where is correct method heap also the simple method which uses stack use heap memory so the memory stays mytype1 new get a pointer to the we use stack here because the values assigned would be lost as soon as we try and access them from mytype1 as this prints because assigning to memory on the this stay assigned until the entire application not sure if using heap memory here is but it anwyay just to play on the safe let me know if is mytype1 this prints correct method stack memory to nusi for mytype1 using the before the variable turns it into a instead of using stack we use the original is this explanation mytype1 this actually does print so the memory is being assigning to the so this mytype1 mt1 prints as

the reasons string are immutable in java have much to do with the two main reasons are the are extremely widely used type of it is therefore more or less guaranteed to be used in a strings are immutable to make sure that it is safe to share strings among having an immutable strings ensures that when passing strings from thread a to another thread thread b cannot unexpectedly modify thread only does this help simplify the already pretty complicated task of but it also helps with performance of access to mutable objects must somehow be synchronized when they can be accessed from multiple to make sure that one thread attempt to read the value of your object while it is being modified by another proper synchronization is both hard to do correctly for the and expensive at immutable objects cannot be modified and therefore do not need string interning has been it only represents a small gain in memory efficiency for java only string literals are this means that only the strings which are the same in your will share the same string if your program dynamically creates string that are the they will be represented in different immutable strings allow them to share their internal for many string this means that the underlying array of characters does not need to be for say you want to take the five first characters of in you would calls in this what the method does is simply to create a new string object that shares underlying but who knows that it starts at index 0 and ends at index 5 of that to put this in graphical you would end up with the mystring v quick brown fox jumps over the lazy shared makes this kind of operations extremely and since the operation neither depends on the length of the original nor on the length of the substring we need to this behavior also has some memory since many strings can share their underlying

the risk of being back an opposing point of view i first encountered while reading on it was a point of view that was very but made sense to me upon and setters are of getters and setters is in opposition to the fundamentals of object oriented data abstraction and overuse of getters and setters will make your code less agile and maintainable in the long they ultimately expose the underlying implementation of your locking implementation details into the interface of the your field needs to change from a to another string is better optimized or supports a different need to change the private data the the and all the client code of this class that calls these getters and than design your classes to and design them to or ask yourself why writing a what are you doing with that perhaps displaying that data on or doing some processing on is this process better exposed as a method of not to say that getters and setters have their in i believe the fundamental reason for their use is to interface with the visual studio but if you find yourself writing them in probably best to take a step look at your and see if something is try to an example to a class that represents a bank account int in lets say const return void deposit int const return void dostuffwithaccount account print account int balance deposit some money into deposit take very long to see that this is very poorly are an awful currency deposit should be a function of the getters and setters make it more difficult to fix the since the client code dostuffwithaccount is now bound to the we used to implement the account lets make a pass on this code and see what we can a class that represents a bank account float void void void o dostuffwithaccount account print account deposit some money into float depositamt is a step in the right you could have changed the internal type to and still supported the account int old float support the old const return void provide a new interface for the float const return not how to expose getter for float as well as void it take long to realize that the arrangement is doubling your workload and complicating matters as you need to support both the code that used ints and the new code that will use the deposit function makes it a bit easier to expand the range of types for class is probably not the best since the account balance is a natural operation for an the overall is that you must be careful with getters and do not get into the habit of writing getters and setters for every it is quite easy to expose and lock yourself into an implementation if you are not

the strategy should the call will load the target assembly into the from there it is possible to do type inspection and create instances of those think the easiest and most reliable way to create the instance is to use the each def as type in dim inst on your another suggestion would be to move the block into the loop instead of out of having the block on the outside of the loop means that if any given type in an assembly does have an you will discard all types from that moving it inside will allow you to discard only the types that do not work as the current behavior may be your intent

the validation can be done at many different levels and usually none of them is of the model can be populated with invalid data that do not come from the but we can also create forms whose data do not go to any the direct validation in models is unsually not integrated with our form rendering which causes problems if we want to show the error messages and the form with the data of the solutions have their own pros and it would be perfect to have a system that ensures us that the validation finally must be done at some if the form does not validate some then the model does and vice i heard of such but i must note that the validators in the frameworks unsually are you can pass the post data to but the same can be done with the information retreived from a properly parsed mysql

there an easy method of accessing custom configuration data through a interface without requiring each execution context from configuration information which would be computationally like most other classes in library are annotated with the following public static in visual members of this type are thread any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread my reading of the objects returned from the and other similar methods must not be assumed to be and thus should not be used by multiple execution this prohibits storing a in a singleton that would otherwise be because while the access to the section object may be the members on the object itself are not calls to are likely to require of the configuration files and allocating new instances which has a high overhead considering the configuration is not likely to ever change after copying the configuration data into another object that has been made seems to defeat one of the main benefits of using the configuration package in the first place access to and validated configuration information without much boilerplate is there a way to use in a manner without resorting to excess parsing and allocations of configuration does implementing your own free you from the lack of guarantee provided by microsoft even though accessing it through the interfaces if how would you implement it to be when access to the base indexer is required for accessing the configured safe usage of

there is an important semantic difference between the really semantic or both iterable they both work with a for difference is for example important when one wants to loop multiple does this ever come have to be more in the rare cases when you need to make two passes through an iterable there are often better say processing a you can iterate through a list all you why did you get tangled up with an iterator instead of the okay that reading a file in two and you need to know how to reset the in this a and is or a close and a that feels you can to get a list which allows two passes with no so not what if we have a file so big we read it all into for obscure we what down to the of two on the first we accumulated an index or a summary or an index has all the a is a restructuring of the with a small change from to preserved the data in the new in both we need the file we can use the index or the algorithms can be changed to one pass of the original iterator or iterable and a second pass of a different data is neither lybl or this is algorithm you need to reset an iterator an example of an simply a i in print i in print is trivially i in print i in print times in is trivially write an api that an and when someone refuses to read the api documentation or refuses to follow it after having read their stuff as it to safeguard against the case were a user provides only an iterator when multiple passes are are both examples of insane people writing code that breaks our simple someone is insane enough to read most not all of the api and provide an iterator when an iterable was you need to find this person and teach them how to read all the api documentation and follow the api issue very these crazy programmers are remarkably and in the few cases when it does know who they and can help have to read the same structure multiple algorithms are a fundamental not do element in element element in element element in element element consider something like element in for f in element most this kind of of your algorithms results in a program that might be easier to optimize and might be a net improvement in

there is no need to expose a setter for the bars internally you hold a reference to the which as kent suggests could be marked as through the getter the caller can do what they want with the collection with the methods available but crucially they can never change the internal reference you hold to the collection then allows you to control what methods are as jamie having the property return type would result in the bars property exposing a readonly exposing means the contents of the collection could be a setter on the property would leave it wide open for the caller to do what they want and you are no longer in the question edit it really depends on how the object will be your main concern is to initialise from an existing list of bars list of bars previously latest code example for forces the caller to initialise via the constructor but then also allows them to change the collection via the foo new allowing an object to be initialised via the constructor you need to ask yourself why you are doing is the to allow the calling code to supply values that can be subsequently changed via you want to restrict how the object is forcing values certain combinations of to be set on object construction and remain fixed throughout the lifetime of the need to ask yourself do you want the caller to be able to change the contents of the bars collection after the object has been no make the bars property expose a read only yes add a default constructor to the object so that the caller have to supply a list to initialise but they will have the option to do so if they so choose via the overloaded

they are actually static readonly values and not that has a distinct difference in because constant values are by the various compilers and hence impossible to track their usage in a compiled static readonly values however are not copied but instead this is advantageous to your question because it means the use of them can be you use reflector and dig through the notice that minusone and zero are only used with in the vb it exists primarily to serve conversions between decimal and boolean why minusone is used coincidentally came up on a separate thread just today if you look at the value notice used to why they are explicitly defined i doubt there is a hard and fast there to be no specific performance and only a bit of a convenience measure that can be attributed to their my is that they were added by someone during the development of the bcl for their convenience and just never into the issue a bit more after a comment by the definition of uses the modifier however it is emitted as a at the il the compiler uses a couple of tricks to make this value virtually indistinguishable from a literals for this would show up in a language which recognize this trick recognizes this but does

thing i quite is how you plan to prune your you have 2m rows per but you specified how much data you plan to at some point you will want to expire data by age all this want to do it by dropping not by executing a delete which locks up every single partition for an incredibly long time it has to do a full table scan to find the rows to then leaves your table no smaller as the partitions are full of by hash of might seem sensible for but partitioning by time could ease contention when you come to prune old and will definitely be a good has a feature called which you will almost definitely need to use all the time in order to achieve concurrency and this mandates a meaning that you can only do deletes by dropping dropping partitions is also good because you can get the disc space said all of 80g that big and i might have been tempted to store it all in a single and use innodb to enable concurrent and if you did use you could have a primary key of which means it would cluster rows with the same probably want a secondary index on to enable efficient test this with your production data sizes and let us know what you

thing that can be done is to use javascript to grab the current time when a event occurs that triggers a to your passing this value back to your server side will allow you to render it back to the client as your initial time that you can compare of using i believe you can put script inline at the end of the document so that it runs as soon as the browser renders that portion of the this will allow you to compare the current time when the inline script runs against the trigger time that was captured when the user initiated the as mentioned by since you can only reliably control the of the it would be best to include in your metrics the server page generation if you have both you can at least see how much of the total time is taken by page and how much is dependent on the various delays that could occur on the

think a controller should be dealing with model tend to think that controller is really part of the ui i prefer to inject a service layer the controller and the rest of the the web tier accepts http unmarshals parameters from request objects into objects that the service interface can deal and marshals the response to send all the work with units of and dealing with model and persistence objects is done by the approach is more service it separates the service from the user leaving open the possibility that several clients can reuse the same it makes the layer that marshals requests to the service so easy to switch out soap services for rest or ejb or corba or whatever the next new thing will

think deriving your class from your class demonstrates confusion of is your data editing object a special type of database or maybe it would make more sense to say the data editing object needs to use a database is the difference between is a and has it seems to be falling out of fashion you can use a singleton factory call to get the database then any function which needs it can simply call if you make the handler the first time it has to do any then nothing needs to even worry about initializing do check if the instance variable containing the handle is a resource handle if call the remember to decide what to do if the connection then you just need a way for the handler to find i would have the factory call do not the variant way of doing that is for the constructor to get the current database handler and put a reference to it in an instance this can be done several requiring it in the constructor might or you can fall back on the singleton factory call this technique gives the object constructor a chance to deny instantiation if the database handler initialize factory call can check

think it depends on the the maintaining developers of the code if they are design pattern illiterate then yes it can increase because most things one understand are the team is design pattern they understand the basics and understand the premise behind why design patterns are useful as important when then i think they reduce all computer science maybe a fledging science but got decades of experience under its the chances are somebody has already solved your problem once whether the answer is a design data structure or rather like this humorous by i recommend the read nothing else to waste five minutes on a friday

think it might be an improvement if when posting example code we at least put comments in that say you should put error handling code in at certain this might at least help somebody using that code to remember that they need to have error this will keep the extra code for error handling out but will still reinforce the idea that there needs to be error handling

think looking for a method like static var enum1 var enum2 while yield return but it should do the job note that particularly useful about this method is that full it can take two sequences of arbitrary types and return objects of any solution of course assumes that you want to compare the nth item of with the nth item in if you want to do match the elements in the two sequences based on a particular then want to perform some sort of operation suggested by danbruc using do let me know if it neither of these approaches is quite what after and maybe i can suggest something an example of how you might use the method with the comparer function you originally prints out to the console all the results returned by the comparer function in this results element in

think option 2 is the having each thread doing independant tasks would give you best 3rd approach can cause more delays if multiple threads are doing some operation like disk reading common sockets and so to use windows messaging framework for processing requests depends on the work load each thread would i think windows restricts the of messages that can be queued at the most to for most of the cases this should not be an but if you have lots of messages to be queued this might be some thing to take into queue gives a better control in a sense that you may reorder it the way you want be depending on	
think other answers being quite in real world after 2gb of memory consumption your application will behave really in my experience guis generally go massively unsusable after lots of memory was my obviously actual cause of this can be objects grows too big so all operations on those objects takes too much	
think part of it is that imap is usually used in scenarios where the emails are retained on the whereas pop is used almost exclusively for situations where the email is downloaded to the local which is what most isps providing email facilities for their customers want you to do also what most of the customers probably want as although less so as they get more exposure to the internet and things like gmail and reason it is probably preferred by email providers is that it does much like an rss news the pop client will open a connection to the authenticate ask for any email and do whatever processing it and then close the clients generally keep one or more sockets open with the server the whole time they are taking up those yet another reason for isps to prefer mail supports both pop and imap i do not mean to sound like i am having a go at i think the reasons attributed to them above are very pragmatic and	
think part of the idea of oo programming is that classes and logic is separated so it would probably be better to split each class up into a separate as for when to create a new method in a class or a new i think if the method you use has to do with the main operations of that specific class it should be only make a new class when it performs routine or important and keep the right logic in the right

think python needs because they are useful for 2 a dsl or more eloquent syntax for something loop macro is a nice in this python philosophy decided against it if there is some explicit notation you can always ask for a things faster by precomputing things at compile python oriented to so you can always use a function am not saying macros are just that they fit python you can always do without them without much code because you have duck typing and operator as a side i would much rather see restarts in python than	
think rapid prototyping means more flexible sure it is more flexible at the but as the application it becomes harder and harder to theoretically the use of interfaces makes it easier to keep unrelated parts the end of the it all depends on the say there is a if the application is upfront design is necessary to be able to add new features in a timely if the application is then it might be better to use something more

think shane d has a reason which is quite as even i came across the same situation for a table having around 40 data for these columns is uploaded through csvs and used only for reporting purpose and a set of columns to process those are frequently if we maintain one table as a we perform frequent updates on that table and will be updating only 5 columns of feel every update disturbs the row allocation and there is highly possibility of so to avoid i followed the approach of separating data based on me know if any better

think that best place for extension methods is methods or that make existing api easier and cleanier by providing default values to arguments of existing methods or hiding repeating chains of method to the common beliefs that you can classes for which you do not have access to the source you you have no access to private methods and all you can do is to polish public api and bend it to your likings

think that makes a lot of it the policy itself that you depend rather than just the of you going to want to ask the policy questions whether or not an action is that means need an instance of the policy which means it makes sense for it to be passed into the are suitable when you want a strongly typed api where part of the api depends on another but the implementation itself care what the type is with some the collections api is probably the canonical example a care what but wants to expose a api terms of i see that fitting in with your policy	
think that option is built into but with you could just use a simple help make this more declare the regex once perhaps at class level or make it static rather than recreating it all the odds are only using the returned array to iterate over the you can make this faster by skipping the call on the end and just keeping the ienumerable for your keysplitter new regex test key in of the nice things about how works is that this will still only iterate over your results because the method in the function will do lazy depending on what you need to do inside the for loop you might be able to gain a similar efficiency by adding a	
think that resource but common sense would seem to dictate that using 1 timer is probably better than like your timer is set to fire 100 times per which seems a bit do you animate each sprite at every timer might want to try firing times per second instead maybe even might want to look into the built in view animation functions as seems like they would probably work very well for what you are	
think that the lack of a gui editor is a problem with consider there are plenty of wysiwyg editors for that but most experienced web designers touch that stuff with a barge they hand code not because but because they want control over the they want to make it clean and coding is a scientific best left to human beings tried gwt designer very early and i found that it was fairly poor only worked on windows because it had some dlls that went along with but things may have changed drastically since	
think that the programmer has to just start doing a few simple tests to start with are easy to justify as part of like a unit test is almost always necessary to get fast debugging turn just explain how much faster it is to launch the test than it is to arrange the correct set a debugger launch the the test in your just put a comment explaining where the test is and how to run future programmers will see it and hopefully the testing will

think the best approach is to introduce 1 concept at a you need to explain arrays in the first you can detangle almost anything by introducing 1 concept at a would teach them in this can teach simple arrays first so they understand the ability to have multiple data slots accessible from a single variable following need an understanding of you can teach about pointers and how they starting with some simple y sure to give a special emphasis that a pointer is just like any other it stores a memory is no need to get into the stack vs heap just to iterate over arrays with the first the second you can teach more complicated to do pointer i shorthand for arrays to functions as array pointets vs pointer param arrays are continuous blocks of string sizeof works with pointers vs array types size vs buffer more complicated concepts like allocating and the levels of arrays all examples make heavy use of sizeof and printing it really helps to understand going

think the considerations related to the decisions that where made before has changed that the schema those will just help you organize the database so you can assign permissions to all inside a schema instead of having to configure for each decisions involved on whether having the identity flow down to the sql server instead of using the trusted subsytem are pretty much specific to the particular that i like to flow identity like because usually there is still logic being enforced on the application which means the sp are probably enforcing partial because of that that approach also pushes to have more logic in the stored only administrators having access to the user groups in the consider looking at adam directory application i know if it supports integrating it with sql so i am not sure if that will work with that it is worth checking not being able to get the based on your i would assume there is a close relation between user groups and involved database you can get the the user has in active evaluate how adam fits in your and whether the considerations involved into using the current identity flow approach also forget to consider the impact in the project on changing the identity flow of the

think there are better alternatives to option which allows this other developer to check in temporary or experimental code is to have using a language that supports have worked at places where every coder had their own matching their which they could use for things that only they were interested eventually when the code was ready for the checks were instance you might this code is code goes here i think there are sometimes cases when the incremental you want to make record does not function well enough to enable for in such the is alternative is to locally use a dvcs like mercurial to track your then when you get to a stable for the you push those changes out to the be careful of submitting too much at	
think there are two related issues one is the question of code which many of the other responders have commented on in if you can easily reuse the you second question is whether it is sensible to have two applications with substantially different behaviors share a common user this is the more interesting question i the answer depends on what your applications are used for the various applications in an office suite often share a substantial amount of the user interface they have common generally considered as it makes it easy for a user familiar with one application to work with another from the same the other you can imagine cases where sharing the ui will only lead to frustration and agony for your as an extreme suppose you have an smarthouse which allows you to control various aspects of your ultra modern smart in this you have a control that allows you to turn off the cooling system in the this involves a button with a clever icon of a melting ice cube or when you click the a dialog is shown asking the user to confirm the suppose you need to write nuclearpowerplant thinking to save some development you crib the ui from smarthouse lots of things line up just even a need for a button to turn off the cooling system in this new so you reuse the ui from the first your users have all been using smarthouse 2009 for months and and they have gotten very used to turning off the home with that ingrained into them that using that button is a relatively harmless one some poor user comes to the office and logs into nuclearpowerplant he feels a little bit so he clicks on the melting ice cube expecting it to turn off the he even clicks through the next dialog been doing this for months at too bad for he disables the power plant cooling triggering a massive nuclear this is an extreme fictional but you could easily imagine situations in ordinary where a user gets used to a button in app a doing a particular kind of and assumes that a similar button in app b will do a similar kind of if it your users will curse you every time they hit that the question how similar are your applications are the conceptually the but operating on different types of or data from different are they related in that they are part of a suite of tools with many common actions between the or are they really unrelated if they are what is the probability that a user of app a will ever need to use app	
think there can be any specific learning c does for you is give you an a broadening of the into how computers a very abstract thing make you write better code in it just makes you more of a computer reference that wedge made to article mentioning shlemiel the painter is an interesting one but has no relevance that algorithm is not tied to c in any particular way it manifests itself in strings are immutable and completely different from model of so i quite see the suppose one concrete example is optimizing a parser or a lexer or a program that keeps writing to a string buffer all the if you use normal strings instead of a string run across a problem when you build very large a a copy of both and it change the string that was referenced by it creates a new allocating more becomes considerably and you keep adding small things to then shlemiel the painter will manifest then knowing this has nothing to do with knowing just knowing how your language implements things at the low is where having an experiece in c will help

think there is a point where you must draw a line and make a see no way to completely decouple logging from the system because you have to send those messages somewhere and in a way that someone would go with the default logging the default well documented and comes with the default so no dependency issues you save yourself from reinventing the if you are really into doing something you could make a global reporter you can instantiate and configure it at the beginning of your process no redirecting even in a per and call it from no need to pass it around in a multi threaded but that would be can also put it inside another thread and catch log events a la

think this very simple method should help you understand the method will call itself until a certain condition is true and then anumber anumber 0 anumber 1 function will print out all numbers from the first number feed it till 10 wil 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 then stop because anumber is no longer larger then bassicly happens is that will write 10 and then call which will write 9 and then call until writes 1 and then calls which will write 0 butt will not call code is essiantially the same why use recursion you might if a does essentially the well you mostly use recursion when you would have to nest for loops but know how deep their for example when printing out iemts from nested nestedarray a a string nested in an a string even the last stringorarray stringorarray stringorarray stringorarray will a a string nested in an a string even the last function could take an array which could be nested into a 100 while you writing a for loop would then require you to nest it 100 would be enough for the nestedaaray we have but you would nest the for loops even more if you would nest the array another for typeod for typeod for you can see the recursive method is a lot	
think using generics here is cleaner than just doing the cast from form but not the the problem is that the value being returned of the right a and you cast from to or assuming you actually want to parse you should return a string from form b and form a should use or handling user input error is assuming that returns text such as or not immediately clear to me that the

think you are being too what some people do with session objects is not always a good but there is nothing inherently wrong with the is a good use of session objects in the right for caching user specific data that is stored in the db and frequently change except by the actions of that this incurs a memory penalty on the web server as a for fewer hits on the db i am happy to make this because it is far simpler and cheaper to scale to multiple web servers than multiple sql general rule of thumb is to use sessions only for caching that if the code easily reload itself after a session expires without intervention from the i go

think your approach sounds if your wcf services will only be used by your front end i would probably think about hosting the service layer in a windows service and use tcp you have to deal with iis and possibly no but that could require you to change your infrastructure requirements could still use port but you will be faced with other annoying issues related to using ports that iis normally you can start with binding and switch later anyway with minimal impact to the overall is the beauty of the services i would also consider publishing 1 simple facade on top of your two that way your client couple itself to the concepts of your oracle db and unix this debatable you only mentioned the technologies if the two systems represent distinct business domains then keeping them separate makes if you are only splitting them because they are two different systems then i would try to abstract those systems from the passing credentials i would recommend using an authorization policy in combination with for more help on this topic check out if you found it here is an to get you	
think your best approach is simply to use the sendasync method of the smtpclient class to asynchronously send the client new can even pass in a delegate as the second parameter to the sendasync method which will act as a and be invoked when the sendasync method please see the example on the msdn site should give you the best of both worlds in that you can send the email asynchronously without tying up your main executing whilst also avoiding the complexities of spawning and managing your own threads writing a separate

third option is the best for any you will probably wish to add more fields to your person so the first option is it is very likely that you will have a large number of persons to and will want to look up records quickly thus dumping them into a simple array is done in option is not a good idea third pattern gives you the option to use any string as an have complex person structures and get and set person records in a constant definitely the way to thing that option lacks is a stable deterministic ordering is the upside of option if you need i would recommend keeping an ordered array of person ids as a separate structure for when you need to list persons in the advantage would be that you can keep multiple such for different orderings of the same data

this a real program or rather a sample to illustrate a it is not clear why you would restrict access to the artists and albums rather than just to individual media items or even think that the joins should cost you that any db system will do them cheaply enough when you are making a fairly simple criteria match on multiple the problem with putting that much security logic into queries is that it limits your ability to handle more complex drm issues that are sure to bound for what if the album is a collection from multiple what if the album contains a track which is a duet and i only have access to one view is that in those a convenient programming model with sensible exception is much more important than the performance of individual which you could always cache or optimize in the what you are trying to do with queries sounds like premature your programming model as flexible as define a sensible sense of then work on implementing the database and optimize queries after profiling the real

this is not an answer to the compilation errors you are but rather a broader view of the persistence problem you are and deserialization is not the simplest problem you can work my advice would be investing in learning libraries and using they have already worked out many of the problems you will face at one time or plus they already have different output formats first thing you must that is if you decide to go ahead and implement your is what will be the file format and whether it suits all your will it always be used in the same will the platform change you can decide to make it binary as it is the or make it readable for a human if you decide on json or any other more complex just forget it and use a simplest solution is working on a binary file and it is also the solution that will give you a smallest on the other it is quite sensible to architecture changes you migrate from a 32 to a 64 bit deciding the format you will need to work on the extra information that is not part of your objects now but needs to be inserted into the file for later then start working from the smallest parts to more complex advice would be to start working with the simplest most defined part and build from there start avoiding templates as much as and once you have it clear and working for a given data work on how to generalize it for any other i have written the code directly on the so there could be some typos or just about anything first simple approach is just writting a textual representation of the the advantage is that it is portable and shorter in code not than the binary the resulting files will be bigger but user this point you need to know how reading text works with whenever you try to read a string the system will read characters until it reaches a this means that the following only read up to the first tab or end of when reading numbers as an the system will read all valid digits up to the first that input 12345a will consume all characters up to you need to know this because that will influence the way you persist data for later is a long will read but ignore the a b a will produce will read not you pretty much need separators to insert in the output and to parse the for sample purposes i will select the it must be a character that does not appear in the text will also be a good idea to not only separate elements but also add some extra info of the for the elements in the vector you can decide to use a different if you want to be able to read the file manually you can use so that each item is in its own textual inventoryitem const data return o const v o for int i i o will call the above defined you will need to split the input by to get each element and then with to parse the textual template void const t data str create a stream with the st use inventoryitem data quantity in wholesalecost in wholesalecost return data int tmp size without last parameter getline splits by size obtain size as for int i i inventoryitem tmp read an inventory data return the vector reading function i have used getline parse to read the that is to guarantee that the next will actually read the first inventoryitem and not the trailing after the most important piece of code there is the template that is able to convert from a string to any type that has the insertion operator it can be used to read primitive library types for and user types that have the operator we use it to simplify the rest of the code quite a a binary this will be a pain in the ass if you the simplest way i can think of is writing the number of elemements in the vector as a the size is in your followed by all the each element will printout the binary representation of each of its for basic types as it will just output the binary format of the for strings we will resort to writting a number with the number of characters in the string followed by the contents of the void const str int size write the size write the template void t data will work only with pod data and not data void inventoryitem const data void const v int size size could use the size for int i i i have selected a different name for the template that writes basic types than the functions that write strings or the reason is that we want to later on by mistake use the template to write a complex type userinfo containing that will store an erroneous representation in from disk should be fairly binary template void void str int size buffer new create a temporary buffer and read into size str delete void inventoryitem data void inventoryitem v clear the vector in case it is not int size for int i i inventoryitem item item using this the and must be opened in binary v work on v error checking is left as an exercise for the reader you have any question on any part of the just	
this is not difficult to achieve at all and its not a bad idea at it all depends on your project a lot of software products you not projects but depend upon this model so they dont have to rewrite their code ui logic for different client clients can customize their ui the way they want to using a designer form in the admin have used xml for preserving meta data for this sort of some of the attributes which i saved for every field for list multi check box yes then check if no then drop down show or not to on the web positioning i did not care much and simply generate table tr td tags 1 below the other however if you want to implement this as you can have 1 more attribute called cssclass where you can define ui specific properties and also note a lot of ecommerce products follow this kind of dynamic ui when you want to enter product information as their clients can be selling everything under the sun from furniture to sex toys so instead of rewriting their code for every different industry they simply let their clients enter meta data for product attributes via an admin form would also recommend you to look at it has its own pros and cons but i feel it can be used quite well with your

time after playing with but before seem the mvvm i came up with a strategy that i still think has some created an implementation of the icommand interface based on the constructor accepted a target object and an operation using the code looked for a method with name property or method with name or and an event with name or only the first was but the reflected were wired up to a pretty basic implementation of the icommand then created an implementation of ivalueconverter that would create an instance of the previous passing the value to be converted as the target and the parameter of the converter being the operation the above i was then able for bind a command property directly to the source of the operation with specifying the and set the commandparameter property to the name of the in this i got declarative command binding without the command source having carnal knowledge of anything

to read the lisp are vectors of this means that most of those functions are look at clhs gives this item sequence test start end count are sequences of so a call to remove would is a is no a string is item to remove from a string has to be a nothing because the test is by default eql and eql compares the character in the string with your item also key is by default identity and does not change the if your argument is a then you have to do looks at each character of the sequence and makes it into a the string then will be compared with your item using the function this works the cost is that it needs to generate a string from each character of each string is a new way to do it a retrieves the first character of in every test and compares it with the character from the string again the cost is that it needs to get the character five times this the best way to write it if your original object comes as a we get the character from the string once and then remove compares this character with the default eql test with each character in the string it returns a new string of those characters that are not eql to do you expect to in common lisp this is the symbol does not work since a string is not an element of a characters are elements of remember also that strings with one item like are still strings and not a thus and are of different the first is a string and the second is a extracts a sequence from a that means it also extracts a string from another 1 where 1 is the start and 5 is the end appends this means that it also appends returns a new string with the strings and remove parts of a string see also the functions and as in one other answer to remove substrings from a string you need to write some code to extract some strings and then concatenate searches for strings in

tough this should do var count else return count and the above it is not very i also want to take a second to suggest you change the format of your html a little you want to make your code be as semantically relevant to the content it holds as having one huge table mixing parents and childs is not the optimal way of achieving i am not sure what your use case is but consider doing something like could still style this however you want to give it the appearance you although it may not be as easy if you really are displaying tabular data about the parents and that you could then simplify the above with a much more var count count changing the code from a table to a list is not but you have access to the code that presumably generates this you could at least make things easier then by giving all the children a class with the id of the and giving all the parents a common would then allow you to do much faster than the original var id var count count

unit has two distinct the interface and the interface section contains all public definitions procedure the implementation section contains all implementation you use a the uses you get access to the public definitions of that this access is not so if unit a interface uses unit and unit c uses unit you do not get access to unit b unless you use it implementation section has access to the to the unit used in both uses clauses and interfaces of used units are compiled first before it continues compiling the this has the advantage that you can have circular dependencies from within the interface fail need interface interface implementation implementation unit also has an initialization section if it has an initialization it could also have a finalization the initialization section is used to initialize the variables of the the finalization sections are used to you use its wise not to count on initializations of other just keep them simple and also are the foo foo f1 f2 f3 an identifier is defined in multiple used the last unit possible in the uses list is so f1 but you can prefix it with the unit name to solve this the introduction of multi part namespaces are allowed which introduces other nice rec1 baz bar baz which these lines gives an error and does the result change if you write uses this case you have a but that is resolved by giving namespace names higher so the first line

was going to say i know of any such thing but then i saw the other might interest you to know that an execution profiler does exactly what asking about it tracks the amount of time spent executing each a profiler basically works by recording the instruction pointer the address of the currently executing every 10ms or after the program is done you invoke a postprocessor that examines the list of ips and the and converts those addresses into function so suggest just using the instruction rather than the function both because easier to code and because more efficient to work with a single number than with a	
was hoping this jquery would but it added a comment to his but so you might not see it let me explain my i want a type of event to be fired when the user either pauses his completes his not the user is actively dragging the window resize i have a fairly complex and time consuming onresizehandled function i need to but not run 100 times just because the user widened the window by 100px and the event was fired for ever pixel of i guess a best bet would be to handle it once the user has completed the resize event firing multiple times while dragging the resize	
was in charge of development for a game website that had 60 million hits a the way we did it was option user did have the ability to upload images and such and those were put on a nas that was shared between the it worked out pretty assuming that you are also doing page caching and so on the application side of the i would also deploy on the new pages to all servers	
was introduced to ssis a couple of weeks executive i am unlikey to consider it for future pretty sure flow charts were discredited as an effective programming paradigm a long except in a tiny minority of no point replacing a clean textual interface with a colourful one if the user still needs to think like a programmer to know where to drag the program design that you access fulltext navigate using alternative effectively version except by one prescribed method is a massive productivity and a wonderful source of possible there is a particular niche where just but i imagine most etl tasks would outgrow it pretty

was not designed to be and also these protocols are very custom and very complex to streaming sessions do lots of validation and synchronization which will be extremely difficult to of course it is not an impossible but its fairly big task to only other way is to read and save it as local media and use that as a because you can use windows media encoder to read stream and write stream data as local but it still may not allow you to do copy protected	
was originally a question i wanted to but while researching the details for the question i found the solution and thought it may be of interest to the full request is in double quotes and any quotes inside are always escaped with a 400 299 trying to construct a regex which matches all distinct my current solution always stops on the first quote after the i only need all the values including the size guess also provide my solution from my php source with comments and better ip ident and user 2 ss request 8 status 9 bytes end of this with a simple case where the url contain other quotes works 400 299 trying to get support for one or more occurrences of into but find a using came up with this so only the changed request too it eats everything until the last when it should only eat until the first not preceded by a i also tried introducing the requirement that no before the i but it still eats to the end of the string i had to add extraneous characters to make this work in request then it hit if used immediately after any of the quantifiers or makes the quantifier the minimum number of request full 5th may discovered a small flaw in the regexp due parsing millions of it breaks on lines which contain the backslash character right before the double in other break the apache will not log but will always escape the backslash to so safe to assume that when two backslash characters before the double has an idea how to fix this with the the javascript regexp documentation at and expression that matches between containing escaped	
was reading a book called yellow book by rob miles when i came across this love new shiny they are very keen to use language features to show properties can be a bit like when considering properties versus get and set methods i am rather a fan of the old fashioned get and set methods because you know where you are with on the other hand i can see where properties might make life if used in the correct not really sure what he means by what do you guys what does ms i use properties in my programs or should i use	
was reading a couple of articles a while back which i think described a behaviour where you in a application allow an exception to and then handle it in some kind of exception as opposed to within a is weak at the so not having much luck guessing what this feature is called in order to find information about this rings a bell for any of can you point me in the right direction on what exactly the feature is called so that i can search for code is always of but this is mostly just a case of me forgetting the name of the feature and being unable to search for exceptions at application	
was reading on handling corrupted state exceptions and i came across something that puzzled is a fault quote from article error condition can only pass the function containing the condition to that exceptions have the power to pass results of a execution of the current scope every frame up the stack until reaches the frame that knows how handle the unexpected exception system exception the exception to every predecessor the call with the caller and proceeding some function says it will handle exception is known as the exception system will then the state of each frame on the stack between where the exception raised and where it will be as the second as stack the clr will run finally clauses and each frame as it is catch clause in the handling frame is a fault clause in the clr exception

was waiting for a definite answer to but seeing as come up i might as well share what found traced addfieldtofilter and apparently every value you use ends up quoted so you really this by using the name of a fact i see any way to do at least not within this i think need to go with at least for this of course is the very definition of inefficient but then again if computational efficiency was a you be using magento in the first

was working on making modifications to for a there is very little information on how the magento system is there are hundreds of folders and and there are at least a thousand view there was little support available from magento and i suspect the main reason for this lack of information is because the creators of magento want you to pay them to become a certified magento at that time last year there was no stackoverflow first task was to figure out how the database schema worked and which table stored some attributes i was looking there are over 300 tables in and i find out how the sql queries were being so i had just one exported the entire database and at least lines of sql into a file using and i this file into the subversion i made some changes to the database using the magento administration and redownloaded the i ran a diff using and scrolled through the lines file to find which lines had as crazy as it it did and i was able to figure out which tables i needed to 2nd problem because of the crazy directory i had to ftp to about 3 folders at the same time for trivial so i had to keep 3 windows of my ftp program switch between them and ftp each 3rd problem was figuring out how the url mapping worked and where some of the code i wanted was being by sheer i managed to find the model class i was looking by sheer luck and other similar crazy adventures i managed to work my way through and complete the since stackoverflow was started and by a helpful answer to bounty i was able to finally get enough information about magento that i can do future projects in a less crazy manner	
was writing a stored procedure and i ran into a problem where if one of the values is null it be from a statement or whether it be a passed in my expression would evaluate to false where it ought to evaluate to or select select expected it to know missing something anybody have any idea what it why are values filtered out within this with nulls in comparison tests in sql server

way been approaching it is to have a display layer that knows nothing about the gameworld its only job is to recieve an ordered list of objects to draw onto the screen that all fit a uniform format for a graphic so for if a 2d your display layer will receive a list of images along with their scaling and source and whatever other attributes a display object could the view may also be responsible for recieving high level mouse interactions with these displayed objects and dispatching them somewhere but important that the view layer not know anything sementically about what it is that only that some kind of square with a surface and some the next layer down is a program whose job it is simply to generate a list of these objects in helpful if each object in the list has some kind of unique as it makes certain optimisation strategies possible in the view generating a list of display objects is a much less daunting sort of task than trying to figure out for each sort of character how its going to physically render sorting is simple your display object generating code just needs to generate the list in the order that you and you can use whatever means you need to to get our display object list each prop and npc has two a resource database and a character the database assistant presents for each character a simple interface from which each character can pull up any etc that the character will probably want to come up with a fairly uniform interface for fetching the but going to vary a little from object to a tree or a rock need as much stuff as a fully animated npc for you need some way of generating an instance for each type of you might implement this dichotomy using your built in or depending on your you may need to work a little beyond for having each resource database be an instance of a resource database and each character instance being an instance of a this saves you from writing a chunk of code for every single little object in the this way you only need to write code for broad categories of and only change little things like which row of a database to fetch images forget to have an internal object representing your then your job to query each character about where they are in relation to the it is basically going around each character instance and asking for its display do you look and where are character instance in turn has its own little resourcey databasey assistant thing to so each character instance has available to it all the information it needs to tell the camera what it needs to leaves you with a set of character instances in a world more or less oblivious to the nitty gritty of how they are to be displayed on a physical and more or less oblivious to the nitty gritty of how to fetch image data from the hard this is it leaves you with as clean a slate as possible for a sort of platonically world of characters in which you can implement your game logic without worrying about things like falling off the edge of the think of what sort of interface you would like if you were to put a scripting language into your game simple as possible as grounded in a simulated world as without worrying about little technical implementation details what this strategy lets you the separation of concerns lets you swap out the display layer with whatever technology you open software adobe nintendo without having to fuss around too much with the other you can actually swap out the database layer to do things like reskin all the or depending on how you built swap in a completely new game with new content that reuses the bulk of the character collision path finder code that you wrote in the middle	
way done in should soon be a merged into that will provide a lookup for exactly this type of query

way for a small dump your database to sql and add it to your then every time you change add the changes in the dump can then use diff to see changes between not to mention have comments explaining your this will also make you virtually immune to mysql one downside seen to this is that you have to remember to manually add the sql to your you can train yourself to always but be careful if you work with missing an update could be a pain later could be mitigated by creating some elaborate script to do it for you when submitting to subversion but a bit much for a one man in the year gone by since this had to implement a versioning scheme for mysql for a small manually adding each change was seen as a cumbersome much like it was mentioned in the so we went with dumping the database and adding that file to version we found was that test data was ending up in the dump and was making it quite difficult to figure out what had this could be solved by dumping the schema but this was impossible for our projects since our applications depended on certain data in the database to eventually we returned to manually adding changes to the database only was this the simplest but it also solved certain issues that some versions of mysql have with normally we would have to dump the development remove any test log certain names where applicable and only then be able to create the production by manually adding changes we could control exactly what would end up in a little at a so that in the end everything was ready and moving to the production environment was as painless as	
way i can think of is to loop through table one and search for similar rows in table this is how you can do through the table to find if there are rows with same payid and empid in table the method returns more than 0 then disable the from you can also think about a method which can give you intersection of two if these two columns are priamry then this will if then you will need to tweak the code as per your	
way i can think of is to use directory so whenever it found out a file is created in the folder it opens it checks the file type and executes it if it is an you do have to watch out for incomplete file uploads	
way i see this you should return a 200 because it should be a valid say one of your urls is and that url displays a specific item in your a user enters what do we expect the action to to list all of the items in your of course at least a paginated your url structure and how directory levels and parameters relate to one	
way i tackle this is i have seperate configuration files for each deployment the i copy the config files for the type i am for on staging i would copy the into the root of the my script would call to compile the	
way i use a viewmodel is somewhat in my case it actually wraps the model class passing most of the data on to the that way all standard business rules in the model still work the way they are supposed to right the viewmodel only exposes those properties actually needed for data binding or other ui additionally the viewmodel might contain other used for data using your customer public class customerviewmodel private customer public customer return if if void propertychangedeventargs if public string get return set public string get return set public string get return firstname public static var result new var customers foreach customer in model customer return public event propertychangedeventhandler private void if new class customer public int id public string firstname public string lastname public int numberofcontracts public static customers new customers new customer firstname lastname numberofcontracts 23 customer firstname lastname numberofcontracts 22 customer firstname lastname numberofcontracts 33 customer firstname lastname numberofcontracts 2 customer firstname lastname numberofcontracts 5 return inotifypropertychanged public event propertychangedeventhandler in your ui you bind using the following code in the viewmodel does become somewhat large but a lot can be put in a base class and all properties that go to the model are exactly the same t4

way that you can avoid this problem is for any project except for a which has no project of doing a from your source control always do an from source inside of visual and do a get latest from solution vs will only pull files that belong to the not a perfect answer when you perform you will likely end up pulling down every file in your but it has worked very well for this requires that you are using a source control tool that offers vs integration it also requires that you add any but required files to your or they will not be pulled down by	
way to achieve a behaviorid to the javascript function to execute desired function in event	
way to do it is by the the 2nd argument of the function is a context selector that tells it where to by default that is the entire but you can specify something like a if no context is looks for dom elements within the context of the current html if you do specify a such as a dom element or jquery the expression will be matched against the contents of that what you have will the above is the optimal way of doing speed difference for your average use case will be i just prefer specifying the context whenever	
way to do what you want to do is to use a function as the this way you are declaring a whose public members can be something like constructor stuff no need to instantiate seems to me like you are mixing concepts from statically typed languages with more dynamic why would you want to access a member of an object that has not been

way used it is if i have two implementations of how to do something in a class and i want to choose one at without having to continually go through an if statement void avoid if using a else if using b type of void void typedef void this is only practically useful if you feel the code is being hammered enough that the if statement is slowing things done deep in the guts of some intensive algorithm i still think more elegant than the if statement even in situations where it has no practical use but just my

way you asked the you basically want to validate on client which should be a under any just submit the number and validate it using if you want immediate use but do the validation you can do your with an ajax	
way you have done is the right one except that you need to wait for the callback before trying to access your	
way you have it implemented is an acceptable way to do what you need to one way to improve your way of doing this would be to use on the dictionary rather than a second object used to synchronize the that rather than passing around an extra the resource itself keeps track of whether a lock on own a separate object can be useful in some such as synchronizing access to outside but in cases like this	
way you usually use ecc for encryption is by using works this the intended receivers public key from a this is the static a temporary ecdh this is the ephemeral the keys to generate a shared symmetric the data with the symmetric the encrypted data together with the public key from the ephemeral receiver can now use the ephemeral public key and his own static private key to recreate the symmetric key and decrypt the can read more in for efficient sec elliptic curve section	
ways are supported for a there are times when one is more appropriate than the nice when you are using many bits from the drawback is that need to qualify each reference with the module module import nice that imported items are usable directly without module name drawback is that you must list each thing you and that not clear in code where something came to use depends on which makes the code clear and and has more than a little to do with personal i lean toward generally because in the code very clear where an object or function came i use module import when using some a in the

we are storing most of our data as json this works very well with hadoop on the backend and is easy to handle in ruby on the front my data types fit the natural pattern for lets say i have a class pet and a process feedpet that feeds a i also have a process walkdog that only applies to which is a kind of my data is organized such that i never need to worry about trying to walk a pet that a i would like to do is have pet and dog extends with dog having an additional method but i figure out how to map this to i have a class pet with a species data so the walkdog process would call instead of can create a dog extends and i can serialize that to json using the jackson the json object will have a leash but assume that i want to feed all the all pets have a so the feedpet process deserializes the objects to but this loses the leash walkdog process can do this because it knows all of its input is going to be so it can read it as a dog and write it back out as a there any way to serialize java objects to json such that i can preserve their thinking something like rails single table but it would have to be something that the json libraries or inheritance in json with java and

we data bind gridview to an objectdatasource control and then perform a i realize displayed gridview fields are of type but does gridview also know of what type the underlying data source values are for particular gridview column if data source will populate gridview with bunch of then these integers will have to be converted to before they can be displayed in which control will perform the gridview or regardless of whether gridview or objectdatasource performs a how is that conversion simply by calling on an control performs the type or data source

web service is the way if you want them to communicate found it easier in some situations to coordinate via database for my web app has bulk email to make it the web app just leaves a database record behind specifying the email to be the winapp scans periodically for these records when it finds one with an it takes the appropriate this works like a charm for me in a very high volume cannot quite do this in the other direction only because web apps generally sit around in a timing loop are ways around this but they worth the require some type of initiating action to let the web app know when to reload the to do you could use the following code to do a get on a wrcontent objstream i think need the stream reader but i include it for objstreamreader new then reload the file in the pageload method whenever this page is	
web sites in vs2008 ones without a build does a kind of validation where the site is to and web site dependencies are copied into the web bin want to do this exact process but at the using that i want an msbuild task that my msbuild target can execute that validates the web reporting any compile errors and copying dependencies to but does require an iis virtual and does not precompile all the aspx and other files to dlls in the bin aspnetcompiler task appears to do a full creating a directory full of compiled aspx and it requires an iis virtual so i think this task will work for can this be to build web site the way vs2008 does using

what a comment from another newcomer to iphone background i was a c programmer about 15 years ago and since then moved around technologies quite a bit now an adobe flex developer in my day by trying to transform myself into an iphone developer i bought a book on iphone sdk development in i also bought in i thought be set with these two but after a couple of days reading and working through exercises it was clear i was hopelessly i bought another book this sdk from the pragmatic bookstore this is a work in progress book but looked for turns out this book took me further a great piece of work the early chapters were paced nicely and i was able to follow along and then all of a sudden they began to assume i could recall perfectly the lessons learnt and the procedures followed in earlier chapters and i began yet again to flounder a little the worst thing i find when trying to learn something from a book is to have to jump around from place to place constantly to make any sense of what meant to be i but bear with i bought another iphone from now this book assumes for a beginner to iphone this book hits the no jumping around necessary and finally i found i was what finding is that all three books in conjunction with one another really seem to provide me with a more complete picture collectively i have a great set of tutorial and reference the book not touched on so much yet but i expect that to be what i need it to be a reference manual for the not need that until much deeper in to the slowly emerging from that horrible at the deep end and i swim very feeling to one where i can at least tread hopefully with a bit more paddling be able to touch the bottom certainly my confidence is returning to address the original question personally if i did this all over i think i would have gained anything by starting out building for the mac first and then to the i would definitely have lost less hair had i bought the apress book first that for me was the book that made complete sense of everything for i think then the sdk pragmatic book was the best this is the path suggested to a colleague and confident a good this

what basis did you determine that you must translate your documentation into did you show the documentation to these japanese developers and then they said that they understand asking because all japanese take at least 6 years of all through middle school and high and even starting earlier despite it is true that most japanese do not english very most japanese developers can technical documentation in you probably cannot have a conversation with and they might not even be able to ask you questions very well in english through but most japanese developers that worked with worked with a can english documentation you do find that you need to translate your be sure that you use a service that specializes in technical it requires a very different skill set from normal you should have the vendor translate a small piece send that to your developers in and have them review the translation first before you get the whole thing are lots of firms that can handle this work but depending on volume and you might search for an independent contractor first using a search i know a lot of good translators that prefer to work solo rather than work for one of the big localization possible way to find an independent contractor is to use or and do a search for technical whatever you want to search for a search on technical many potential candidates showed with their skillsets feedback etc all

what i am trying to do have a user select a file to since i am only going to accept i will test the i also want to limit the file size to under so i will test implemented in code if the file they have selected then i want the label to say and store the file upload information for a later button this will happen once the user has finished filling out the rest of the i will put an updateprogress control on the page while it is checking if the file is i would rather not have it post back for so if i can get it to that would be this will all work fine if i take the label out of the update happens when i run is it will go to the else statement of the first if and return select a meaning that is returning the only reason i can see that this is happening is because the updatepanel can not access that info from the fileupload label if filename if type not please choose select a is not working within update

what i see the wpf gridview is just a view mode n for the listview with most things in advise you to do this with the viewmodel that means is that you have create a viewmodel object for each row in the the real model would be your datatable the view model is seeded with data from the real you create a new viewmodel instance from each row in your you then populate the grid with viewmodel view model exposes properties for each value you need to display in the actual so in this case your viewmodel would expose 3 properties each up your ui column to bind to the respective properties in the your would contain the logic of updating property2 with the right computed value on a both of them should trigger off propertychanged notifications and the gridview should reflect the updated values in both

when i ask do you not use cpan i am referring to the people who refuse to use cpan modules high quality ones like not all cpan code is of high and it is fine to stay away from modules that are trivial or are based on experimental code got annoyed at a developer the other day for wanting to bring in just because he know that strftime was in on someone want to know how to do something without resorting to the perl module commonly suggested for that he or she did not want to install the module from this made me think about the reasons i have seen people avoid using cpan and i came up with five reasons for this behaviour and the solution for each scare you get over scare your sysadmins work around them installing in your home directory and use the lib are using a hosting service that prevents you installing modules get a better are cheap services that behave like target machine necessarily have the module use par or target machine is totally locked down you to rbash and have to provide code to a third party inclusion on the combination of 4 and going the are using an embedded version of perl that load modules you are but this is very if you use and why are the answers above not i am not asking why you install directly from cpan on production i am asking why you avoid using the modules from cpan via packaging systems count as using cpan to do you not use cpan

while technically misses the the solution is not to use but to not use at crux of this problem seems to be in understanding what does is which is completely different despite having the same it takes a string and it as perl this is unnecessary and dangerous and results in spaghetti code and you absolutely should not be using it so early in your perl programming you have found the gun in your sock discovering that it can blow holes in things you are now trying to use it to hang a better to forget it your code will be so much better for does not do what you think it i even have to know what you think it that you even used it there means you i also know that running with warnings off because perl would have screamed at you for assume that is set to the above is equivalent to which even valid perl perl print found where operator expected at line near operator before string may clash with future reserved word at line of uninitialized value in print at line not sure how you got it to work in the first i suspect you left something out of your maybe tweaking editor until it have to do anything magical to read an environment just is now as you just the same as same thing with perl print i suspect what you really want to do is run that editor and use that quote in some shell am i

will not talk about it is well known and talk about nginx vs second one is much more feature easier to configure and it has a way better when talking about deployment of fcgi or scgi application api django actually there are several important points that lighttpd provides support for spawning fcgi and scgi applications on its meaning it can fork and manage it for you if you scgi spawning use lighttpd when it comes to nginx you manage you application on your own use your own startup provides support of both sockets and unix domain sockets for both nginx and apache does not provide support of unix domain sockets for provides native support of cgi in nginx you should do a silly workarounds using regular expressions to provide that is not does not support cgi meaning that if you have a simple task to do that can be easily done with it is impossible for nginx to handle of fcgi for lighttpd is way simpler about nginx is indeed nice web but it my first is my little experience with development using various strongly recommend to use the problem was fixed in nginx there are still too many issues with nginx and for example which actually means that you deploy streaming comet methods behind development style of nginx is very patchy if there is some problem say a bug or missing feature reported it would not be ported to other modules like http or scgi and vise examples url decoding are general nginx development is very patchy and documentation is inconsistent you can find in some pages stuff this module is based on module the documentation there may be give yourself a favor use

work as a physicist in a uk i should emphasise that different areas of research have different emphasis on particle physicists do computational modelling almost exclusively and may collaborate on large software whereas people in fields like my own write code relatively i suspect most scientists fall into the latter i would say coding skills are usually seen as useful in but not much like skills are seen as useful for programmers but not with this in have you used for developing scientific data what what do you use for data analysis and plotting is done using generic data analysis packages such as which can be thought of as these packages typically have a scripting language that can be used to more specialist analysis may have a dedicated utility for the job that generally will have been written a long time has the source for and is pretty some more techie types might use the languages that have been mentioned matlab with gnuplot for software is commonly done in although we actually use delphi which is somewhat there any training for people without any significant background in been to seminars on grid 3d learning boost given by both universities been as an undergraduate we were taught vba for excel and matlab but is more you have anything like version bug although people do have personal development our code base is in a shared folder on a which is kept current with a synching would you go about trying to create a decent environment for without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists physicists are stubborn step at a i am trying to replace the shared folder with something a bit more perhaps finding a svn client which mimics the current synching tools behaviour would say though on the for most natural science time is generally better spent doing

work for a software which has an in house predictive dialer and we need to implement a solution to obey to the i have a database with the customers that i need to and another database with the phone numbers i as the system is a predictive based on the performance of the time averages and dial more or less calls per logged system usually this number is around 3 4 calls per logged phone number repository for the predictive dialer is a postgresql the predictive dialer pick a bunch of numbers up from the database and send a command to the pbx to dial the and then the business logic goes on to transfer the valid calls to the call center and etc is irrelevant as my problem is before the need to implement the list this list will be provided to our company by a government in a csv on a daily every time i receive a new csv i have to purge the old and put the new one in first thought to implement it was do a batch the do not call list with my current customer but i think depending on the size of both the would be very performance and sometimes could not be finished had this kind of problems with batch processing and not a nice thing to second idea came up when i thought about how large institutions handle and authorization such as credit card or user i thought that creating an authentication service for the do not call list and changing the algorithm of my predictive dialer to check each number against this authorization service before dialing would be only confabulating i have no idea which idea is the or if i got it totally wrong and should look to another my question what would be your store the do not call csv file in use use do the batch processing or am i definitely know not the first person in the world to have this kind of so please enlighten is the right solution for a authorization

workflow sounds reasonable to got alice and bob each with their own repos on and each presumably pulling down from there to a localmachine to develop when they finish something they want to they can just push it to their repo on where visible to the other one thing i think you left out is repo owned by quinn in when alice bob decide something is production they push over to quinn then takes that and runs it through his rigorous set of tests and such and eventually if it passes he pushes out a new quinn could be some kind of continuous integration robot like hudson or cruisecontrol or somesuch that does the autobuild and testing this be it owned by quinn or a is also likely the place that alice and bob sync their repos with pulls the set of code that everyone develops workflow you outlined is as far as it i hope this answer

working on a client class which needs to load data from a networked been suggested that adding a standard caching service to the client could improve dearly like not to have to build my own caching class well known that these provide common points of it would be far better to use a class that somebody else has developed rather than spend a huge amount of my own time debugging a caching developers have a general purpose caching class which can support all kinds of got options for expiry and other methods for it looks really unfortunately i cannot find anything this good for can somebody suggest a ready for me to my to limit the number of objects in the to limit the maximum age of objects in the object to select multiple forms of storage disk well in use by at least one any looking for local caching of the server which i connect to is already heavily memcached is not appropriate because it requires an additional network traffic between the windows client and the there a standard 3rd party python caching

working on a project where a bunch of software is being ported to a new hardware a certain percentage of the software modules should be subjectively similar on the new hardware code review for some of these modules has shown that the port done is been done with a minimal effort or insight the developers doing the work are as often happens with however it has also shown that the design of the software is lacking either handles error conditions badly or just has a bunch of have asked that instead of reviewing code after the port has been we review the design i am told that this might not be a good use of probably because the existing documented designs are not up to i barking up the wrong is a design process inherently is there a way to avoid getting bogged down in the full design or is hands on code always the best way to sort things out even with inexperienced for the answers so yes the will be used in many future also i mention that the code is going to be too a single threaded this alone maybe good enough to indicate the i would like to proactively see if a process of design review can be put into distrustful of just hoping to fix something up when it stops working if something is found in testing to be fundamentally broken rather not redesign come defect fixing the process of design

working on an installer project that consists of an msi file and a bootstrap application that manages the and since the need for some of the prerequisites depends on what features the user chooses to the bootstrap app also provides the i want to be able to force the programs programs and control panel to run the bootstrap application instead of the msi when the user wants to run a modify tried changing the modifypath value under the uninstall registry key to the path of the bootstrap but to no clicking the change button in the arp still gets me the there an easy way to do what i failing is there a way for the msi to detect that it was run from the arp using the change button so that i could get it to show an error message that tells the user to run the bootstrap app does the arp use the same command line arguments that a user would use to run the msi and specify a modify install without having to see the maintenance page of the if what should i look my installer is installing not just one but a suite of each of which the user is allowed to choose not to installing these applications as a because most of them depend on one of them in particular being be easier on the user to have just one installer handle them rather than the separate installers that this new installer is going to applications in the suite all require the same set of it is not easy for the msi to check for the prerequisites until it knows which applications in the suite the user wants to we want to make it easy for the user by having the installers for all of the prerequisites for the applications that the user does want installed launched is the main reason why the ui was implemented in the bootstrap it possible for the msi to launch the bootstrap app and then silently exit immediately while the bootstrap app carries eventually relaunching the the bootstrap app launches the one of the command line args it passes into the msi is a property that tells it that the bootstrap app launched this is currently among other to allow the msi to show an error message telling the user to run the bootstrap app unless an uninstall or repair install was specified on the command do i get the arp to run my bootstrap app for a modify

working with the wpf datagrid from the wpftoolkit and having issues with trying to zoom the entire my initial thought was that it was going to be really easy and i would just apply a scale transform to the grid and animate the scaley properties when the used clicked a this did not work however because the scrollbar was zoomed in making it i need fixed headers and fixed columns on the datagrid so i simple use a scrollviewer outside of the datagrid to handle the the second thing i tried was to just scale the font size in the but this failed because on shrinking the font size the columns stay at the original width and do not i thought i had it working by using the below code which goes into the view tree for the datagrid and adds a scale transform to the scroll content not shown in this i apply a transform to the visual tree item for the headers in the same manner so that it scales as i thought this was working great until i tested out the horizontal scrolling after scrolling works before zooming at all the horizontal scrolling is but after when i scroll horzonitally the display freaks it is hard to tell exactly what it is but it sort of looks like the content that is scrolling off the left of the screen is and coming back in on the maybe it is just all smashing up on the left does anyone have any ideas how i can get this hopefully without throwing out my whole datagrid that is already working quite well scrollcontentpresenter sp st new a new new datagrid zoom

worry about users doing just to break your if they really want to break your code they can without you providing accessors to your internal by returning a constant the common user will not mistakenly modify your prevents not a malicious coder can break it anyway if they really care and know the environment is lost in the compilation process all compilers i know once the compilation unit is converted into binary those objects do not know about and that can be exploited to take int a a a const return int int does not include but redefines an almost exact copy of a int a a int const return int private int a 10 the code above is incorrect definition rule is there are two definitions for class the fact is that with most compilers the definition of a and malitious a are binary the code will compile and and the result is that external code has access to your private that you know of do it will later be a maintenance pain in the that has cost microsoft quite a bit of money in providing backwards compatibility to software that used private parts of the api returned objects versions of the api that shared the same public interface but changed the internals would break some third party application with some broadly available software the provider in this will go through the pain of providing backwards but with lesser known applications they and suddenly your previously running application will fail in all sort of

would add that one of the key reasons for having exceptions is to enable your application to handle errors at the most appropriate level in the code to do something sensible with exceptions provide a clean way to pass information back up the call stack to enable on what layer to handle various exceptions is a key decision in your application the type of application your are developing will affect the when developing a web or desktop it may be totally acceptable to handle the majority of exception types at a very high level this technique can save a lot of code when your application really cannot do much about the error and just needs to tell someone and log in a mission server you are likely to need fine grained control over exceptions in order to deal with them appropriately and keep the threads spinning no matter	
would agree that json may be an excellent approach for passing but to go from php to you may want to use xml only because then you can use xml which may make parsing can then communicate back and forth via http connections or depending on which way data but i expect that it will flow from php so you could experiment with wcf to pass using a rest though php can do webservice client calls you communicate back from the with json or use a webservice response then you have a good decoupling between the two	
would agree with in visual both dictionary objects and methods are referenced by using this can cause some in would point to the connectionstring object with the key in the dictionary objects are referenced by square brackets so would literally mean the method connectionstrings of configurationmanager object using as a story check the page declaration at the top to make sure both pages are the same on the page with the change the line to use the

would amend answer to use an to perform data hiding of the members of the your class however you want using normal oo variables of your class go into a c language the header you do not want to expose the member variables of your object these would be in an oo use an opaque struct first argument to all your all the methods you want to be put their signatures in your method bodies should go into the and methods should be only defined in the file and also declared static so their symbols do not collide with symbols defined in other naming conventions like underscores are unnecessary using this but it means that all your member variables will be functions can be public or although public functions they are part of a global namespace so you might want to qualify their names with a name like also need to make it clear if the caller or the library is responsible for calling and most likely you will have and	
would appear that a simple scheme will work the number of points in the by first computing the convex only the points on the convex hull will contribute to any interaction with any convex bounding so retain only the subset of points on the perimeter of the can easily be argued that the minimal radius bounding must have one edge of the convex hull coincident along the diameter of the if some edge of the hull does not lie in the then there exists a different with smaller diameter that contains the same set of each edge in convex hull often has relatively few so this will go now it becomes a simple minimization if we choose to assume the edge in question lies on the then we merely need to find the center of the it must lie along the current line which we are considering to be the so as a function of the position of the point along the current just find the point which lies farthest away from the nominal by minimizing that we find the radius of the minimal along that line as a just choose the best of the possible found over all edges of the convex	
would argue that you will always do a better job on a a huge reason you will do better is that you will have a better idea of the failings of the previous version and a clearer understanding of the caveat is that if the system is not fully testable tests for and not fully documented then you will have a very hard getting the new system working it comes down to a matter of scope if the scope is small enough then it is likely you will do a better you may have a huge but if you can fix small pieces in isolation then you have a chance at making it however the issue there is that each piece will be probably by the history that it needs to support when interfacing with other

would be fair to say that you can get into trouble with nhibernate if you spend the time to understand how it that the learning curve starts very shallow but ramps up fairly significantly for some of the advanced would recommend taking a look in great book for learning cover the latest but hey what the internet is query tool for editing hbm mapping files and for looking at the results of hql nhibernate debugging detects common mapping problem scenarios for you select and gives you advice on how to solve if you are only doing basic orm operations then take a look at built on top of but does away with any mapping requirements you just decorate your objects with	
would be more doable if you were using an unordered which would always take the same amount of space for the since you are using an ordered i would stick with the as is that ie and firefox make the same amount of space for the marker irregardless of the number of digits in the marker or the size of the so you need to take matters into your own hands by creating the space the trick here is to know by ie and firefox use different properties to create the ie uses on the while firefox uses so have to reset both of these values to achieve

would definitely go for spring together with hibernate for persistency related advantage of using spring instead of another framework is that springs philosophy is to be usually when using a framework most probably start to depend on that framework which can be a bad issue if the application is considered to run for a longer time where you then have also to do maintenance spring uses the of basically your code can but it have call but spring will call you call call so for instance you can normal old java and you have to inherit from any big problem not the in software engineering are fight for reducing them as much as possible since they will make your life harder in maintenance later reduces among your components drammatically by managing the instantiation of components through configuration files and the i want to go the best thing is that you start reading some tutorials at the official initially it may need some time in the understanding but once you got it earn a lot of

would like to learn a language that will teach good programming that sound like you may learn the fundemantals of using a forloop but not the best choice if you want to learn good programming you develop outside a fat ide python is not really a language for not sure about ruby but i think pretty similar in that respect hard to analyze the code staticaly so not much use of ides that try to guess what you are thinking when you push a both ruby and python are great languages if you can make a small shift in your thought process to grasp the that leaves you whith which is a great language and with which you are pretty much stuck on windows i know of a far cry from ms in my opinion is not very well suited for learning the basics of programming not web recommendation is to try and develop something small with any of these and see what you like set yourself a a blogging engine is a bit too much and maybe a service like

would look first at the why you want to do normally applications operate like there is no issue in 2 clients doing inserts at the same time besides wrong approaches in the the solution will vary with the one option is to have a microsoft message queue and move the inserts out of those so the load of the inserts is controlled by the process that reads form the i still fail to see why you want to avoid the inserts from running in parallel from what i read in the other responses i think others do i will quote 2 of your comments on reason i want this is because in the case of a power i lost only one transaction instead of the because before the there are other lengthy jobs that require only when during the insertion there is a need for sequential i read the first i would actually think a reason to want them in you want to be done with them as fast as going sequential will actually increase the time to make the so there is more time where the power surge can the it makes me think that you are probably more concerned in the effect of these processes running on parallel and the insert not getting into the this again means you want to be done with the inserts so not a reason to do them you might have a case for a distributed transaction that also includes the file system was looking at the file system but i recall if they ever did something on the newer distributed transactions are kind of a pain to set up though and access to the ports it good path i have is adding more info to the process to be able to tell where it you might not even code an automatic recovery process but at least you know you will have the info for sure to know something went simplest way is an insert at the beginning of the process and have a flag to signal when it was if it is a long running process you might want to have something more like an status you keep updating to be able to tell in which step it an alternative is writing the status to the file any case it will only tell you that the last step that completed not whether the current step was or not able to be this is what makes the retry logic a bit more as you just continue where it you have to check whether the last step was or not and that depends on each if the above is the it is hard to tell from the you might want to open a different question about long running processes automatic

would normally have two problems with putting a problem aside for a my boss probably go for it because the business will usually need a solution sooner as opposed to and i have the attention span of a gold so if i drop a problem for that i will have to take time to walk through the problem because filled my brain with dozens of other problems in the not entirely because sometimes i do find a more elegant solution when forced to refresh myself on the code and the business constraints that define the but sometimes i just spend half a day running myself into the same that being the idea of putting a problem aside is a good but the time frame often realized a solution while eating breakfast the morning following an end of the day brain lock up to articulate the problem to colleagues often just because the effort will expose gaps in your understanding of the usually the other person find a better solution unless actually working with you on the problem from the just because they understand all the constraints that probably spent days mapping out in your answer the original my preferred method after taking a break and running it by some is to implement the adequate solution and just get something reason is that if the client decides that what they because they never really know what they want in the first you have spent too much time on something be thrown out another reason is that the adequate solution might just be you can move the best reason is that an implementation gets you into the hard questions and from there you might start to see a better like building models as an you can do lots of and even spend a lot of time on nice but really more effective to quickly get a glue gun and starting throwing cardboard models once you can see it in 3d you can start to see where things line up and you wasted your time on nice renderings that will gloss over the

would output everything to a text file and updating the div via ajax by just calling the	
would presume that the answer lies in prefetching the associations that you want that way you can fetch the needed part of your object graph in a single you would do this in criteria queries like query results will give you back a list of cats with both the mate and the kittens you can then navigate to these properties without incurring an if you need a more flattened result do it using perhaps like results new mate offspr will give you back a flattened list of anonymous types with the given this will work if all you need is prefetching the object however if you need to prefetch things such as counts or sums then you will need to examine the projections and alias parts of criteria more if you are trying to exactly duplicate your above you can do so like query will return you basically the same as your hql however instead of using an indexed list it will use a dictionary that maps the alias to the	
would probably be better to use rather than because the latter has the semantics of and the former seems to have the semantics that going you could also easily put an image on such a button as well and it would probably save you the trouble of having to write a javascript you want to continue using i think returning from the event will do since it has the semantics of submitting the the form will just be in order to counter you could maybe place an attribute in the form in the you could then check which button was pressed and depending on that return or returning here prevent the form from

would say just completely remove your delegate delegate is doing exactly the same thing as the you are pretty much writing your own event plumbing instead of using the event an event is pretty much exactly what except that easier to and also makes it easier to unsubscribe from the is no advantage to providing both the event does everything that your and is much more developing this as a class i would suggest just making your class not be and following the more standard the normal approach for allowing logic to be overridden or inserted into your code and allowing events would be to provide hooks for could be used in a situation like this to allow the user to plug in their own in many having protected virtual functions makes this more and much easier to should be exactly an event that notifies the user of some these should be hooks where the user attaches their instead of providing delegates and the base windows forms controls use a protected method and an event triggered by default allows a user to subclass your class and override the logic is probably why want as well as handle the one place where i would provide delegates is in rare cases where your class or method requires logic to be added by a in this you can either provide an abstract base or have a delegate that is passed in for that a good example of this is the method in where is useless without the predicate used for so passing in a delegate makes sense in this that there is no event associated with this really there to provide a different

would say that choosing between sockets and remoting you better consider on what type of application you are sockets are definitely for your own protocol low level programming and the only way to go if you have to communicate to the other remoting is a preffered way to develop new communication where you need to come down to stack and ensure your application talks to the others legacy in case you could go only with better to choose and wcf framework instead of the last one is dead and unsupported	
would say that the standard approach here is to wrap the class you want to as a protected instance variable and then emulate all the members of the wrapped class in your container you can then mark this class and its appropiate members as virtual so that you can use standard polymorphism features with an example of what i is the class contained in the assembly whose code to which you have no virtual class wrapperclass protected closedclass public object new public void public void whatever assembly you are referencing were designed then all the that you might ever want to access would be marked appropiately but indeed this is unfortunately not the case you can even experienced this issue with the base class in my the wrapper class is the way to go it does have its benefits when the class from which you want to derive namely the modifier of methods you want the user of your class to have access the in the bcl is a pretty good example of

would strongly consider moq as well if working with rhino documentation does not clearly differentiate between the number of that you can which easily leads to in writing your tests that can lead to all kinds of introducing myself to rhino for the last two and incorporating it into our tests for a new product version we are i am in the process of changing everything over to i simply cannot introduce rhino to our developers and get success with the learning curve is too time intensive for very little i care if they understand the difference between stubs and partial or strict or simplicity and discoverability of the moq api means all our developers can start mocking right away without caring about niggly i guess it helps that our managers have the same philosophy on mocking that the creator of moq

writing a program that implements the identity based for the actual encryption i use blowfish which i got from trying to adapt the blowfish code to my the difference in my program is that i read the message from the standard encrypt it and print the then decrypt it and print the decryption should be the original i read the input message up to a character and then try to follow the code from the the decryption is printed as unreadable i tried to solve this problem but i got can you please help key of the blowfish plaintext of the ciphertext of the message hold the byte of the to tokens of the initialization offset offset of of bytes in of input msg from the to read input in a loop with to calculate lengths different for the setup to read input in a loop with the index read enter the message you wish to this is my code to read the input loop reads the input from the user since c does not a safe function to read strings with white include the delim character in the the string by the null then i used the code and for encryption course i modified it as message read from stdin not program the input message to up the shared key of the bf the block of 8 characters each there is still more offset the next block of 8 cipher is correctly then i used the code and for decryption i excluded the part where it tokenized the cipher and created the plain char array for i simply passed the cipher array to be decrypted it is output from the encryption and stored in the plain char array with length up the shared key of the bf after is the i get unreadable characters as output of this help is sorry for the inconvenience and many thanks in problem with the blowfish encryption in

written a library to match strings against a set of patterns and i can now easily embed lexical scanners into c know there are many well established tools available to create lexical scanners and to just name the first two that come to question is not about about the best approach to c the lexer example is just a concrete case of a general can see two possible a that converts a source file with the embedded lexer to a plain c file to a set of other files to be used in the a set of c to represent lexers in a more readable already done both but the question one would you consider a better practice according the following the lexer logic should be clear and easy to finding and fixing a bug should not be a in the build the preprocessor will require an additional step in the build the preprocessor will have to be in the path etc other if you had to maintain or write a piece of software that is using one of the two wich one will disappoint you an here is a lexer for the following all numbers be in decimal form including exponential like strings and single lists to lisp 4 on encountering the word end is or at the end of the the two scanner style 1 switch the preprocessor will handle this case skip strings case sum numbers sum case skip lists case stop processing t case skip a char and proceed scanner style 2 there can be up to 128 tokens per scanner with id x80 to xff is a pretty complex macro skip strings sum numbers sum skip lists stop processing skip a char and proceed anyone be interested in the current the code is macros or

wrote one mainly as an attempt to make more when you do the method is explained it is based on but rather than take a large number of small you take a small number of large can tell for that instruction a function is costing you some percent x of total execution more or since it appears on the stack on of about because is a key the call stack exists as long as the program is if a particular call instruction is on the stack of the then if that instruction could that of time would does not depend on how many times is or how long the function call so timers and counters are missing the and in a sense all instructions are call even if they only call sampler is based on the premise that it is better to know the address of instruction with precision that is what you are looking than to know the number with if you know that you could save roughly of time by recoding do you really care that you might be off by still going to want to fix the amount of time it actually saves be made any less or greater by your knowing x it is possible to drive samples off of a but frankly i found it just as useful to trigger an interrupt by the user pressing both shift keys as the same since 20 samples is generally and this way you can be sure to take samples at a relevant time not while waiting for user it was quite another way would be to only do the samples while the user holds down both shift keys something like did not concern me that the taking of samples might slow down the because the goal was not to measure but to locate the most costly after fixing the overall speedup is easy to main thing that the profiler provided was a ui so you could examine the results what comes out of the sampling phase is a collection of call stack where each sample is a list of addresses of where every instruction but the last is a call the ui was mainly what is called a has a current which is a particular to the left is displayed the call instructions immediately above that as culled from the stack if the focus instruction is a call then the instructions below it appear to the as culled from the on the focus instruction is displayed a which is the percent of stacks containing that similarly for each instruction on the left or the percent is broken down by the frequency of each such of the instruction was represented by line and the name of the function it was the user could easily explore the data by clicking any of the instructions to make it the new variation on this ui treated the butterfly as consisting of alternating layers of function call instructions and the functions containing that can give a little more clarity of time spent in each not so worth mentioning some properties of this is not an because if an instruction appears more than once on any given stack that still counts as only one sample containing it still remains true that the estimated time that would be saved by its removal is the

xml file will not return a gstring since the gstring is constructed by the groovy compiler at compile when you parse the xml file you get a not a compiled groovy you really want to embed groovy code inside of an xml document is what you are really trying to do then you should start by looking at you would read in the sql and treat it as an embedded groovy alternative that i adopted when faced with a similar is to use messageformat to substitute values in the s select from then after using xmlslurper on the xml you can substitute values in the xml like from

you able to change the output to use ul instead of a you then you might want to take a look at treeview what i use for all semantically more appropriate to use an ul rather than a table for a but in your case would depend on having the chance of changing the code at in case you i think you fade out i had a similar problem in the so suggest fading out the inner table then hiding the no point in calling 3 faster and more readable if you just do again after you the inner innertable else

you already have an array or an ienumerable then you could do this in one assuming that got an array or from paths new path6 result then how about writing your own extension method to static class public static string string string return that would allow you to chain these like result	
you already have the code for splitting the words into an this function will let you select the longest you wish your phrases to and return to you an array of arrays containing your generated terms of all iterated as far through the array as we should this part of the array to the return is a pretty long example	
you already have to implement code to handle a layer on top of your my not store the actual not needed for you need the actual for each starting at output not output then encode both child nodes first then the same do if then read return new node around it with no bit was decode left and right the same and return new node around them with those but no is basically any node that have this you can calculate the exact size of your output before writing to figure out if the gains are enough to justify the this assumes you have a dictionary of pairs that contains the frequency of each where frequency is the actual number of for 10 each in freq calculation takes the leaf and nodes into and one less inline node than there are would be number of and those two would give you the number of bits total that my approach for the tree the encoded data will is a that would yield the from root down to that character in the a to do which assumes one character is just a simple bitwriter if read it back if return new node leftchild node rightchild return new example use node class public byte public node public node public node node value leftchild rightchild public boolean return leftchild a sample output from a specific character is just 8 so the size of the tree will be 10 5 1 49 tree could look like 12 c e b 6 5 1 the paths to each character is as follows is 1 is to calculate the output 6 occurances 2 bits 12 1 occurance 3 bits 3 6 occurances 2 bits 12 2 occurances 3 bits 6 5 occurances 2 bits 10 of encoded bytes is 43 that to the 49 bits from the and the output will be 92 or 12 compare that to the 20 8 bytes necessary to store the original 20 characters save 8 final including the tree to begin is as each character in the stream is encoded as 8 whereas 0 and 1 is just a single the space in the stream is just to separate the tree from the encoded data and does not take up any space in the final the concrete example you have in the you will get 3 2 b c d e 1 1 1 1 001a1b001c1d01e1f 59 000001100101110111 18 59 18 77 bits 10 the original was 7 characters of 8 bits you will have too much overhead of such small pieces of

you are creating destroying tables programmatically during the normal operation of your i would say this is a very bad sign that something in the database design is systems can and do handle tables with that many to make any meaningful sorts of queries on that number of you really do have to choose your indexes carefully and i you really have to know intimately how the table will be i dare say it would be a good deal less complicated to implement than the approach you proposed of creating new tables arbitrarily based on ids or numbers with less complication comes greater ease of and less chance that introduce nasty bugs that are hard to you are really keen on splitting into multiple then i suggest that you look into how other people do rather than creating tables create a fixed number of tables from the based on how many you think you are likely to and allocate records to those tables based not on some arbitrary thing like how many records are in the tables at the but on something predictable the zip code is an example or the category the document is or the domain name or country of the user who created or something logical that you can use to easily determine where a record ended up and it will be reasonably spread of the benefits of data partitioning this where you create all the partitions to start is that if you need to in future relatively easy to move to multiple database if you are creating and destroying tables going to make that less

you are doing a small number of looping is but if the batch processes ever get you will need other alternative to what other suggested if you end up needing the logic is to change the proc to allow either or individual by making the parameters optional gui will need to check to make sure all required parameters are passed for individual and adding a parameter for a batchnumber to be passed in for you can put the logic for both in one batch number is do the current if it is passed go to the batch processing part of the for batch the insert proc can becalled by another proc that generates a new batch inserts the info you want to insert into a work table including the batch then it uses the batchnumebr as the input parameter for the insert still will have to write the logic for both but since they are in the same they will be easier to maintain and you will be less likely to forget to update both

you are using you are not i would strongly suggest migrating to it from its very easy to you can build a with all your udf methods and have the inherit from then in the onrequeststart method set a variable called the entiure you can then use to access the its very nice and simple way of handling if you like you can have all your cfcs inherit from the same basecomponent so that all your cfcs have those util functions as native makes unit testing cfcs very easy because the cfcs dont need to reply on a passed reference to the udf they are decedents of challenge with this approach is that the extends attribute of a cfc cannot be an so depending on how you package your this can be hard to the easiest way to handle it is with a coldfusion

you familiar with other functional are you trying to learn how python does functional or are you trying to learn about functional programming and using python as the do you understand list directly equivalent for x in i think was once slated for removal from python as being redundant mostly equivalent for x2 in is a difference in how it handles the case where the sequences are of different as you fills in none when one of the sequences runs whereas stops when the shortest sequence to address your specific trying to produce the could do this by writing a function that takes a single argument and prints followed by print you could create a list that looks like use your original print way to do this would be to explicitely build the list you could pull in the contains many clever functions that help you do programming in in this we want which will output its argument indefinitely as you iterate over this last fact means that if you will get endless since keeps going as long as one of the arguments is still producing is just like but stops as soon as the shortest iterable this helps a little different in python essentially returns a generator

you give some background as to what you are rarely any reason for explicitly using on variables other than to clean up a namespace of things you want to not sure why you are calling or running is fine a different use of objects when the exact time they get finalised matter strings like you may as well let the variable drop out of scope when your function it will be and it cause any harm till manually calling for such variables just clutters up your objects which need to be finalised immediately an open or a held you be relying on the garbage collector anyway it is not guaranteed to immediately collect such it happens to do so in the standard c python but not in jython or and is so not you should explicitly clean up such objects by calling or using the new only other reason might be that you have a very large amount of memory and want to signal you are done with it before the variable that refers to it goes out of scope example seem to fit either of these circumstances so not sure why manually invoking the garbage collector at

you have an existing object model and you are looking to migrate to an orm solution then i would say nhibernate would certainly be a good have to make additions changes to your domain model classes to support nhibernate goes a long way towards supporting persistence ignorance in your domain although you may find you need make some minor changes such as marking more methods properties as virtual than you otherwise would for mapping your existing object you can generate the schema for your this is a huge time saver for domain driven just this functionality is supported via the method with fluent nhibernate or via the hbm2ddl tool with standard nhibernate mapping this also of with maintainability changes to your object model can be quickly reflected in your database fluent nhibernate for mapping helps to make the initial mapping quite fast as you get autocomplete and a simplified mapping this will also help to give you the maintainability you are looking for your mapping is declared in code with fluent so refactoring tools will change your mapping you may also find that you can use fluent nhibernate automapping and avoid manually mapping your object model for the most entity framework for this will be more while entity framework is a capable orm in many it is not as mature as nhibernate and there are a few reasons in this case specifically why i think probably not the best will have to make a lot of changes to your existing object model to support entity if you want to use the currently supplied tools for entity framework you will probably need to migrate your code to generated partial classes which inherit from the entityobject entity framework base this inheritance requirement may or may not be a problem for you depending on your existing object you could avoid this by supporting in your code but this is and i think you will lose a lot of the built in tooling support for managing your will almost certainly need to manually create the database with a good sized object model this is typically not an insignificant entity framework does not support transparent lazy loading out of the sure transparent lazy loading is something you are used to with an and it is supported by most other nhibernate of but with entity framework you will find that you need to explicitly related objects parent and child before you reference them in your there are workarounds for this but not a in my for or where you are trying to leverage an existing object nhibernate is a better for the entity framework linq to sql or even become more viable may also want to evaluate commercial orm offerings such as i have little experience with this particular tool myself generally object to paying for an orm when there are good free but it is highly

you have is a relationship with additional the we have a similar structure except in our case a person may have multiple roles on a so i struggled with the same one solution is to create a projectperson class that extends person and adds the role class projectperson public string role project class now has a collection of projectperson but the person class has a collection of project because it make sense to extend the project class to add have to do some additional work up the person in the projectperson to find the role on a project from the second solution is the standard way to handle relationships with additional create a projectrole class and model it as the many side of two relationships from project and that both project and person each have a collection of important to consider how well your data access strategy will support the model in choosing a you want to avoid scenarios where loading the collection requires one or more trips to the database for each object in the

you may want to start looking into the php 5 exception remember though that just because something is new mean that you must adopt only adopt those features that you need and make sense in your being i feel that exceptions are a good concept to grasp and even if you decide not to adopt them you will be all the better for the would like to suggest that you read exceptions 5 has an exception model to that of other an exception can be and caught within code may be surrounded in a try to facilitate the catching potential each try have at least one corresponding multiple catch blocks can used to catch different classes normal execution exception is thrown within the or when a catch matching thrown class is will continue after that catch block defined in exceptions can be thrown within a catch would also encourage you to read is an this is a java tutorial but the concepts are an error occurs within a the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime the called an exception contains information about the including its type and the state of the program when the error creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an in order to implement a global exception handler in order to establish a default exception handler that will handle previously unhandled you will want to us the

you need to be able to highly responsive will not scale very well cannot accept more than one connection at a but for small scale being careful to get context and write the response asynchronously it can appears i misunderstood ability to accept you can accept multiple connections concurrently however other facilities to host code would avoid reinventing the so unless there are very specific requirements that preclude why not take the easy serious use creating an http handler class that implements ihttphandler or or even an to handle the requests is the underlying type that implements et right solution really depends on what you mean by around 500 one at a time or all at on the comment 500 at and noting that the in step includes another http i doubt using httplistner will be able to handle the load without ensuring every operation is asynchronous context and performing the onward http request and then sending the which will lead to some more difficult there is a very good reason to avoid using iis will be easier as it is designed to support large scale client request loads with rich whereas httplistener a programmatically controlled http protocol expanded based on more details of

you never add a assignment operators or virtual functions to your structure using for allocation is frowned upon in but i consider the usage of it okay if you document it in the comments to your unsigned int unsigned int i remember right declaring an array without a length is it works on most compilers but may give you a if you want to be compliant declare your array of length int packet return but you take the size of the structure into the code will break once you add new members to your better do it this int s sizeof sizeof packet length return write a comment into your packet structure definition that data must be the last allocating the structure and the data with a single allocation is a good you halve the number of allocations that and you improve the locality of data as this can improve the performance quite a bit if you allocate lots of does not provide a good mechanism to do so you often end up with such hacks in real world

you only have 1 row in the the cardinality for the index should be of just counting the number of unique you think of an index as a based on buckets a then the cardinality is the number of how it when you build an index over a set of columns then the database goes over all the rows in the looking at the ordered quadruplets of those 4 for each say your table looks like b c d e 1 1 1 200 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 1 what the database looks at is just the 4 columns b c d 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 that there are only 3 unique rows those will become our but get back to in also a record or row identifier for each row in the so our original table looks like a b c d e 1 1 1 1 200 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 1 when we look at only the 4 columns of really looking also at the row a b c d 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 we want to do lookup by and not by row so we produce something like we group all the row ids of rows that have identicle values 00000001 and the values of which are and have become keys for our lookup table into the rows of the original none of this really but it should give you a good idea on how a implementation of an index might be the bottom line is cardinality just measures how many unique rows there are in an and in our example that was the number of keys in our lookup which was that

you post a more complete hard to see how there would be that particular error with out some form of goto or flow changing most commonly see this error in code like the somecondition goto code is fundamentally the reason why is that even though s2 has a not executed if somecondition is the goto statement will jump over the initialization and at the last line of the program s2 will be uninitialized and essentially point to may also want to check out this page which gives hints on how to decipher this particular valgrind common cause for this just found is when you pass over some integer constants to a variadic which are put on the stack as but when the callee gets it as got a problem on was almost about to give up and just consider valgrind being then realised that simply casting it to long fixes my upshot take this messages

you want one set of tables with poolid poolname as thetxi use separate databases rather than multiple tables that all do the same you restrict the variation between the accessing of different pools to the initial you have to recode your selects each or have dynamic other advantages of this approach of a database little bit more admin but not know what your application but really really think carefully before creating all of the tables in one that way madness if performance is the only thing that concerns you need to measure take a representative set of queries and measure their the difference in performance for a single query between the many databases model will be if you have one you can tune the hell out of if you have many you can tune the hell out of all of speak for anyone point is for well tuned there will be practically no difference in performance between the three options in multiple multiple so you can pick the option which is easiest for in the short and long the best option is still one database with as thetxi then multiple depending upon your if you need to know exactly what the difference in performance is between two we give you that you need to set it up and test multiple it becomes easy to throw hardware at it to improve

you want the user to change the virtual directory you can simply remove the dialog from the user click installer project the click on you want different parameters for the web virtual application pool that is normally selected by the installation address dialog you can override with a custom action as others have in my experience custom actions do not help with setting defaults that the user can change because they execute the dialogs that ask for user easiest way to set some defaults that the user can override if necessary in a dialog is to do the the welcome a textboxes dialog example visible properties for all the textboxes to false so no textboxes are the bannerbitmap and bodytext property so it looks somewhat like a the necessary properties you want to override in the set the default value in the most useful properties where the files are to be the virtual directory to be created in the specified the application pool to use this must it be the website where the virtual directory is to be created this is the for the web for also note that the site must is a full list of properties for the installer can be found you really want better control over the iis setup i would suggest changing your project to a standard windows installer project and creating custom install actions so that you can programatically create a good place to start to understand programmaticly creating these things is biggest reason for doing it this way is that custom actions run prompting but the app pool and web sites must be created the installer can

you want to both trap invalid use of the library to access the objects when they have been as well as have a api and in the then you could consider have a different api for debug and nondebug suppose for simplicity that you have only one class of objects you call this class the pointer type which you return from the api for accessing the internal objects is then defined objectptrfacade objectptr object the facade is class which you it works roughly like objectptrfacade copy constructor and assignment here object operator const return object operator const return object return this whenever you build a debugging you have a special kind of smart pointer in use which asserts before accessing the object that its is higher than that the object still if the object has been you get a failing which is better than a null pointer general of course it is so that using does not help if you have users of the because they could call and then still make a reference after the returns a which is	
you want to break the usercontrol out of the something you can do to play around with the element placement in the z plane is to use a grid as the outermost container not doing so and use this as a guide to laying out your since items inside of a grid can occupy the same space and are based on the order in which you might be able to get the functionality looking sure if this fits what trying to but worth a items within a container are going to be clipped at the boundaries of their parent so to accomplish what looking for i would think the usercontrol would have to be a sibling of the stackpanel instead of being a child of

you want to use of a tag as just a label or a name for a particular it is very helpful in my experience to tag important milestones in a whether for production release or even for interim qa you often will want to go back in time and see the source code for a particular you branch upon you can always figure out which revision was released to but this is kind of a pain compared to just looking at a if you use release branches then it will be easy to lose track of which revision was used to create a particular problem with svn is that it blurs the distinction between tags and anyone can always commit to a so not guaranteed to be in other vcs like a is you can adopt a team convention to prevent commits to or even maybe use commit hooks to prevent commits to	
you want to use overlapped on windows then you might like to take a look at some articles i wrote over at the code project which might provide you with a starting these use io completion ports which are the most efficient way of doing overlapped on windows and come with complete source a link to the articles and the latest source your brief problem description hard to tell exactly what might be going most likely that you are assuming that your reads will read the same amount of data that you are writing and this just the case with tcp is a stream of bytes and your reads need to take that into account and loop accordingly until you have reassembled a complete

you were doing this for a create a you mention so obviously working with the apple allow iphone applications to dynamically link against other libraries at so your only option is to create a static a static library is linked into the application executable when my no static library project template in what likely have to do is start with a different iphone xcode template and add a static library hang on to the default application you can use that to build a simple test application to make sure the library actually actually use the library in an need two the compiled library has a and all the header in your finished link against your static and need to the header files so that the compiler understands what are available to common technique is to create one header file that imports all the that you only need to import a single file in your source for creating your own custom a simple tutorial here that should get you you can probably copy the default templates and just customize them to suit your struct syntax looks like struct cgfloat cgfloat are are declared in header so you can click on the name of a struct to see how little trick for creating structs is to do something like apoint the compiler knows the order of fields in the it can very easily match up the values you provide in the curly braces to the appropriate of more convenient to have a function like so you can write that like cgfloat return y that this is a not a so it lives outside of any or although i think the compiler complains if you define it in an is defined as known as an you can see the definition for that in the cocoa header difference between an inline function and a normal function is that the compiler can replace a to with a of which avoids the overhead of making a function a pretty minor but for a function that it makes

your application is under vb6 then i strongly recommend that do the redesign to a class hierarchy in vb6 the reason for this is that in any conversion you try to preserve the behavior of the old is stretches out the project time to do this and do a redesign at the same making the design changes in the applications original language first then you are assured that any bugs that result are due to the design not the done three major conversions of our software in the past 20 to to object oriented design in and to it is straight forward to make a design in vb6 that is ports over to the trick is to hide the specific vb6 apis and constructs behind a interface do the conversion i recommend working from the top change over your forms first to which calls the vb6 com then convert each layer over until you reach the bottom if you try to change the design and convert to another language for any complex application you will double the conversion
