1 the in the prototype applies to the that dict int as function with a argument of type pointer to constant dict which means you can change the but not you want to get the effect you probably declare it like const int rule the applies to the word that is to the left of except when it is first in the type and then it applies to the next changing change the pointer in the main since the pointer is passed by assigning to the the compiler checks that the types are in this means that you can only add not remove as you should you use the you should use const on all you as you probably want to change the dictionary the i use any since the data are to be changed a good signature for it would int you would be able to change the calling pointer to delete the first

2 i just have to assume the integer indexes in the iterations is not a complete solution but i get pass this i could only determine if a 0 is an original 0 or a 1 that was converted to a 0 then i have to use and this would output is like 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 originality of my approach is using the first half of the examination of a row or column to determine if it contains a 0 and the last half to set the values this is done by looking at x and and then y and in each based on the results of the first half of the if a 0 in the row or column was i use the last half of the iteration to change the to just realized this could be done with only 1 boolean leaving 1 to posting this hoping someone might just do i spent way too much time on it not to the code in as integer b2 as y as integer 0 to b1 true b2 for x as integer 0 to scan row for at x and width x halfway through konw if a 0 in this a 0 is found set my first boolean to if x if 0 or 0 then b1 end the boolean is false then a 0 in this row was spend the last half of this the this is where if i change a 1 to a 0 it will cause the to so for now i change to a if there was a way to change to 0 yet later tell value had changed this would if not b1 if x if 1 then if 1 then end end 2 block do the same as the first 2 blocks but i switch x and y to do the if x if 0 or 0 then b2 end if not b2 if x if 1 then if 1 then end end

a char is really just a and all that that evalutates whether the bit the in the intx member of whatever pointer points to is not the inverts the so all the 0s become 1s and vice then the 1 i puts a single 1 in the desired combines the two values so that only the desired bit is and the whole thing evalutes to true if that bit was 0 to begin is bitwise it takes each bit in both operands and performs a logical producing a result where each bit is set if either operand had that bit 0b11000000 0b00000011 is an assignment in the same way that means means using bitwise operators can make things easier to read in some but it will usually also make your code significantly slower without strong compiler

a class is various static data about the class is stored in as long as a live reference to this class instance the class instance cannot be garbage believe that part of the problem has to do with whether or not the gc should remove old class instances from perm or every time you hot new class instances are added to the permgen memory and the old now are typically not by the sun jvms will not run garbage collection in but this can be enabled with optional command if you hot deploy enough you will eventually exhaust your permgen your web app does not shut down when undeployed if it leaves a thread for example then all of the class instances used by that web app will be pinned in the permgen you redeploy and now have another whole copy of all of these class instances loaded into you undeploy and the thread keeps pinning another set of class instances in you redeploy and load a whole net set of and eventually your permgen fills can sometimes fix this command arguments to a recent sun jvm to enable gc in permgen and of that a different jvm that employ a fixed sized permgen or that does gc on loaded this will help if your web app shuts down completely and leaving no live references to any of the class instances of any class loaded by the class loaders for that web this will not necessarily fix the due to class loader well as too many interned strings in some out the following links for more two bolded ones have nice diagrams to illustrate part of the the dreaded permgen unknown permgen outofmemoryerror the permanent permgen errors how to deal with out of memory

a couple of issues going on when you are using sql notifying the workflow of events and having the workflow publish events is persistent and asynchronous and the underlying plumbing of the workflow is not in the way you might something horrible happens somewhere in the sequence of events that will eventually cause your workflow to transition to a new then the workflow will revert to the state it was in before attempting the activity this keeps the workflow in a consistent state since being is a bad a transaction scope as done above is but you have to remember that the only time transaction scopes actually work is when the classes within the using block are aware of the the transaction you can do is have your call to wrap things in a when something goes you can vote for a but this still the method on your you can give some specifics about what trying to accomplish at a higher there may be some things intrinsic to the wf that might better suit you than trying to shoehorn a transaction scope into the did some digging and found a couple of different places where we are told that is no api to manipulate the scheduler work unfortunately for us what this means is that any sort of rollback behavior that we want going to have to implement by hand on our i knew more about why you were trying to rollback work queued through an edes i might be able to suggest some potential architectures for accomplishing your task without the wheel times out of 10 when i run into problems like this where it looks like wf just support what trying to the problem is because either kept too much code the workflow or tried to put too much code it and refactoring where my work is done often fixes my problem without requiring me to write new

a lisp programmer i would wish that the java community understands the following as objects can be named or but they can also be objects of this allows functions to be passed around as returned from functions or stored in data this means that functions are first class objects in a programming functions add much to the they just allow you to write functions in a shorter closure is a function plus a binding closures can be passed or returned return this allows the function to refer to variables of its even if the surrounding code is no longer you have in some then the question comes up what to do about there are languages that have but not in the functional programming world a and b as is nowadays the smalltalk had are anonymous for a long but then some dialects of smalltalk added support for as can imagine that you get a slightly different programming model if you add functions and closures to the a pragmatic view the anonymous function adds some short notation where you pass or invoke that can be a good closure plus allows you for example to create a function that has access to some variables example to a counter now you can store that function in an access it and invoke the context for the function object is now not only the objects it has access but also the variables it has access to via this is also but you can see that variable bindings access to object variables now is an when should be something a variable can be accessed in a and when should it be a variable of some object when should something be a closure or an you can use both in the similar a usual programming exercise for students learning scheme lisp is to write a simple object system using result is a more complicated programming language and a more complicated runtime too

absolutely this can be accomplished and the reason and purpose of the print media in mind that stylesheets are cumulative so if you want to incorporate all your styling from your normal screen stylesheet then you need to include to your link means that css rules in the screen stylesheet will compete with your print stylesheet rules in terms of if your screen stylesheet declares a your print stylesheet must exceed that specificity in its rules or match them and appear a lesser specific rule override that screen if you specify the table width in the html eg then lost the battle because virtually no way for a stylesheet rule to override what amounts to an inline css you must declare the width in your screen then override it in your print

accepted answer is right but you may have redundancy in your regular means match the start of a means the string or the string means at means match the end of the in all you are saying is match my strings at the beginning of the line since you care at the you could do this are two cases where this reduction be you doing some with the matched so you want to match the whole line to pass the data to something using a regular expression function that wants to match a whole string rather than part of you can sometimes solve this by picking the a different regular expression function or for example in python use instead of

addition to answer i totally like to suggest you consider defining the attribute map in this will make your program extremely flexible and will factor out a lot of code you even realize you an attribute can know what field it binds to on the what field it binds to in the a list of actions to execute when the attribute changes recalculate might apply to both strength and it this you have no code per attribute to write a class out to the db or display it on the you simply iterate over the attributes and use the information stored same thing can apply to attributes and skills would probably derive from the same base you go down this probably find yourself with a pretty serious text file to define attributes and but adding a new skill would be as easy 20 coordinates probably the best some adding a skill like this would require no code change it could all be done in data pretty and all the data is stored in a single skill object attached to a you of define actions the same weave you attempt to weave a basket from case weaving you have the case weaving you make a lame subtract 10 create basket value improve skill weaving case weaving you make a decent subtract 10 create basket value improve skill weaving case weaving you make an awesome subtract 10 create basket value improve skill weaving case weaving you made the basket of the subtract 10 create basket value this example is pretty you should be able to visualize how it would be done with absolutely no imagine how difficult it would be to do anything like that without code if your were actually member

advantage of png is full alpha which allows you to have smooth edges and shadows in in web the main disadvantage is that it only supports lossless which for complex images means a very large file on the other hand offers great compressibility for complex but no seen flash elements with highly compressed images that also have smoothed edges and i know much about flash and have no idea how this is this is basically the effect i would like to be able to do a complex image with transparent shadowed questions does lossy compression with transparency work in there flash specific layering tricks being used are the shadows generated or rasterized into the image as i would do with a there any swfs or swf generating scripts that could replace a png image with a lossily compressed thinking progressive enhancement to improve loading speed of certain design if this would it be feasible to write there any formats that allow lossy compression with been hard for me to find specific info on djvu might be a should we be pushing browser makers to support another there other solutions to this everything in flash or accepting enormous file sizes are the current some other and canvas may be able to apply but supported by could cut up a png along scan lines and compress those with leaving the edges as this would be nasty in but it would work in all sounds like a fun write it by the could write a lossy image filter that can decrease color complexity along the png scan lines to improve compression within the png i just this had to but i find anyone know of for your image plus for the	
advantage with the sql stored procedures is they are portable to other db2 udb with minimal or no but db2 external procedures would be a better choice as you can do more with a procedural language than sql would say cobol would be a better fit for db2 external stored procedures than java for the below you would be able to reuse some code from existing converting a cobol sub program to a stored procedure or stored procedure to a cobol sub program is very easy to you would be able to use existing cobol development team who has functional knowledge with the	
advantages of an abstract class to specify default implementations of invariant checking to slightly more control in how the methods are to provide behavior related or unrelated to the interface for are merely data passing contracts and do not have these they are typically more flexible as a type can only be derived from one but can implement any number of

afraid given that a functional language the strictest it would be rather difficult to do so i the primary way to make good use of parallelism in is to use via the async module i the tpl parallel which is being introduced with is going to fulfil a similar role in notably it can be used in all languages equally though i say sure exactly how going to integrate with the existing async perhaps microsoft will simply advise the use of the tpl for or maybe they will leave both as an option and one will eventually become the de facto here are a few articles on asynchronous in to get you

after posting this i noticed that an had the same but still keep mine around since more verbose and even has working code you only had one instance of each item in the original item and your items represented binary items 1 2 4 8 problem would be simplified to generating a sequence of all numbers that can be represented by these no 1 2 1 4 your problem can be viewed as simply asking for the sequence of numbers that can be represented by not binary but a numeral you could write a counter for this weird numbering system to iterate through values 0 and start with incrementing the least significant digit and carry over to the more significant digit when exhausted all the possible values that digit can items we have 12 x we have 1 x counter if return var value if return return var set for digit in var value for i i set output looks something like snip big snip

agree it should be kept simple but most of the scrum framework can be used had several people working in this fashion both on projects as well as on still an owner thats in charge of defining the business value and the backlog should still be part of a bigger scrum enterprise then he probably needs to feed on part of a bigger product team its either a 1 or so its really but thats daily yes between the 2 or if its just that 1 person at good time to go over tasks and think about what impediments need to be surfaced to the scrum of scrum or to the product still a good especially if part of a larger scrum enterprise thats working in but even without good chance to catch up with demo what you energize retrospect and see what you can do plan for the next that in case of working outside of a scrum enterprise scrum of sprints can benefit from being shorter than usual since the scope is probably smaller and the planning overhead but it depends on the it can be held i think killer programmers need to retrospect on their own and take action on things that hold them even keep a chart in your workspace to help you with making board burndown you need you can have them in your work space on the they can be but they really help even if one can gtd things help a single person and a if that person is doing project work then a sprint burndown and release burndown provide a lot of if doing work its still a way to verify on track or and apply relevant measures master the person should be his own scrum if the organization had a coach helping the then he should also help this scrum sum up its clear to me that the values and principles underlying apply for person teams as also clear that most of scrum can be applied as questions is what the individuals involved the the the po are all on board and believe that the make and strive to it will they then first get to the point where the overall thinking makes then deal with the individual	
agree that it could be more in for all of these are acceptable entry void void int int versions returning use the return value as the exit code for the if you care about receiving any you can use one of the versions which take any arguments given when the program is launched are it be more flexible but never struck me as a significant problem in	
agree that it may seem like overkill to have an business layer but my question if the business classes are essentially empty wrappers for the dal is the business logic in the app being in these i often see it spread throughout the ui and dal code in the which defeats the entire purpose of having a business layer in the first you are going to have a business then it should encapsulate as much of the business logic as including validation and various methods of if you essentially let the business layer be a bunch of data transfer it is not providing any value and you should probably consider developing your architecture without	
agree that problem looks like a classcastexception and not the using java serial com port at and it is much easier for me to set either you want the dll in the bin not as was at least working for using netbeans and also found it helpful to put the jar and dll into various bin and folders in the that if you have multiple versions of the jre on your you might not be using the one that you think you are as a practical matter found it more helpful to just copy both the jar and dll into the various bin and makes it just a paste i recommend java serial com port because it solved my problems with usb serial i had fits with rxtx because it would crash when the usb was winjcom solved that problem and others as it has very helpful error make sure your serial drivers are downloading an update fixed my other

agree with both tom and abufardeh will the productivity and outcome outweigh the complexity and learning is this methd better for getting all the requirements before development ensuring these requirements are both and getting all the requirments first seems like common but a large percentage of programs do things in parallel thinking no problem to get some requirements requirements creep is a the movie pentagon is an to anybody who

agree with john architecture makes use of some frameworks and patterns in their own right are largely battle tested and have a reasonable amount of community support to warrant commercial but there enough specific community support or example projects out there to warrant the advantages the framework definitely great as a reference if wanting to use a couple of the techniques implemented in the framework what makes you want to avoid	
agree with john in that winforms and wpf are quite close to one another but wpf offers more of a for allowing to implement more independent of the final ui elements used can be easily and obviously wpf allows much more fancy would strongly recommend this blog for some basics and for a clean wpf shows a nice implementation of a rather generic helper for wpf i really like that and i do like that the code is nicely separated from the user control itself by using attached which makes it much easier to use and

agree with the other answers that you should look at your schema and indexes before resorting to 10 million rows is well within the capabilities of any of the major database if you want some resources for learning about the subject of sharding then try best lessons from shoup on architectural principles video and scalability moore gets to punt on sharding not to do	
agree with the trigger although i would use a join to inserted instead of a i want to point out that username is a particularly poor choice for a primary usernames often change and when they do you need to change all related it is far better to have a user id as the key and then put a unique index on then when the user name you need to change anything

all else being equal either way is which to usually depends on the overall architecture of the application or class library in which you find the if the data access code seems tangled with the object then it might make more sense to split it into two classes as if the crud methods are delegations to a dal with maybe then leaving them in the user class should be complexity is more or less the same in both a between a assembly with few classes or a assembly with a larger number of also assuming that the crud methods should be easiest to get the code written right now but consider possible refactorings in the future should you find that be better that

all your queries are going to be based off the you get any added benefit by setting an index on the pk since it should already be indexing by the only other possible things i would suggest is looking at normalizing your table that is even an option or by splitting off items into other you can refine what is being pulled back in each query and only pull the items when needed using off the limited description of very large database with a single it is hard to locate any easy and obvious ways to optimize without looking at what kind of data you are actually storing in your	
all your services are part of the same application there seem to be any reason why you share the cache directly via a shared object the simplest way of doing this is via a static you choose this one thing to be very careful about is thread if your cache is concurrently accessed via two wcf you must ensure that the two sessions are not going to interfere with each other by both changing the cache at the same if the cache is your need to do this is but you still might need to synchronrise initialisation of the

allows you to use a method which has parameters which are a base type of the parameters in the delegate method delegate signature defines what types will be passed to the the method itself can have types that are less in your when the delegate is invoked as string is being it is perfectly ok for the actual method to only want an object because a variable of type object is allowed to hold an instance of type is most useful in event handling scenarios where you can write an event handler like this that can be attached to almost any event when the args parameter being passed is more specific like void eventargs something

also going to assume that is supposed to subtract a number from all items in the reason not getting any result for z is because building the list on the way into the which means that when the stopping predicate prolog works way back out of the recursion and z becomes uninstantiated is z is z is z is z is z is is going into the recursion first and building your list on the way maybe like subtracted is head changed is the order of the rules in the recursive predicate and the terms of the stopping now it recurses until it reaches an empty at which point it instantiates the result variable with an empty list as then it bubbles back up adding values to the list as it does this

also majoring in cs and specialized in ui maybe your cs university did not have courses about ui is not the same as the former is about how the program should look the latter is about what the program should are some books that i would recommend you to if you want to get more into ui in alphabetical face the essentials of interaction make me a common sense approach to web 2nd design of everyday inmates are running the why high tech products drive us crazy and how to restore the interface a software engineering a preview and some additional material is course that i went to was mostly based on the user a software engineering i have not yet read the book just skimmed through but it seems like a good book to start learning ui also all the other books are then when you have read some theory from the you just need to practice ui design until you develop a sense for good and bad and get some training in requirements gathering and usability testing

alters the orientation of the entire element you declare it not the text content inside more like property than transforming an element change how its content size is calculated how its layout is affected by that algorithms for vertical and horizontal sizing are different and difficult enough to get right to being no real consistent way they could accomodate content with arbitrary so is like using it changes where the content is but not anything to do with layout if you want to include one in a table need to set the explicitly to accomodate the expected rotated if you know that in advance you could potentially hack it up with for me on the span is also rotated like the however on windows with its the rendering look a image could come out considerably

always had doubts when it comes to designing proper report of you have the following to be i will use suppose you want to give a report of the various if something goes wrong not really just informative behavior of the easy solution is to put print doing print am starting to do step print did step print am starting to do step print did step print am starting to do step print did step this is quite suppose that this code is going to end up in a i would not expect my library to print stuff i would expect it to do the job sometimes i would like to provide not only in debug but also to keep the user informed that something is actually in the process of being print is also bad because you have control of the handling of your it just goes to and nothing you can do about except solution is to have a module for doing am starting to do step did step am starting to do step did step am starting to do step did step has the advantage that you sort of know a unique place for your logging and you can tinker this service as much as you you can silence redirect it onto a to or even to a disadvantage is that you get a very strong coupling with the logging basically every part of your code depends on and you have calls to logging third option is to have a report object with a clear and you pass it doing am starting to do step did step am starting to do step did step am starting to do step did step you can also pass the reporter object to if they have more to it reduces coupling with a but it introduces coupling with the instantiation of the nullreporter this can be solved by using none as default and checking before calling which is because in python you have to write a conditional every time c you could define a if reporter is not doing option is to work and have an signal as your code it emits information with proper status and anyone interested can subscribe to the signals and provide nice and very but requires a little of as i think this can quickly be done with the python battery you can raise exceptions with a meaningful error but this of course can be used only if you are exiting from an error it does not work for occasional like to clarify the fact that the situation is more and not limited just to a sequence of invoked it could also involve control if print to print list of files from remote report could also be into the actual so you would have a in the and routines as a first question therefore do you think is the best design for some code in the case of a to be at the same time silent when noise could be disruptive for the but verbose when to handle a balanced intermix between logic code and reporting code between code and error checking has been solved with what could be done to partition the of reporting from the code logic more thoughts for the think not only a matter of decoupling the logging code from the logic i think also a matter of decoupling the information production from the information similar techniques already in particular to handle ui but i really see the same patterns applied to the logging i accepted the answer from marcelo because he points out at the factual evidence that a compromise is the best solution in this and no silver all the others were interesting answers as and i was really pleased to upvote all of thanks for the information during code best	
always prefer a wrapper whenever using third party allows me to define my own exception handling mechanism avoiding users of my class to know about external if later the third party changes the exception handling to return codes then my users need not be rather than throwing the exception back to my users i would implement the error something like enum bool int price int price bool breturn breturn breturn return bool myrequest bool breturn false the error code and

am in a similar working on a web app that is targeted at it and required to support the same set of minus general things learned so in as many of your target browsers as you make sure you have time for this in your development can get you part of the way to but will eventually miss something on some plan some time for debugging and researching fixes for specific you need something not in a toolkit and find a free code invest some time to write utility functions that encapsulate the yourself about known browser so that you can steer your implementation around few things conditional code based on the only as a last because different generations of the browser may have different test for behavior first then common functions and if you look at the for a specific browser type version when the dom is for script access is different in just about every a good toolkit will abstract this for handlers are different in just about every a good toolkit will abstract this for dom particularly form controls or elements with can be tricky with and while not standard kinda using with strings that contain bits of html seems to be more reliable across browser i have yet to find a toolkit that will let you use to add a to a form element in differences are just as important as js javascript features array seem to be pretty reliable and consistent across especially relative to the some small joy in the fact that the language entirely different on every really run into any js but always one of the first browsers i

am looking for a good way to keep a design document up to date with the latest are a small team game graphic project sales most of our projects last a couple of at the start of the project a design is made but we generally find ourselves making changes or new decisions throughout the most of these changes are so we want to keep our process like the changed design results in more time needed this is generally taken care so that part is at the moment we have no nice way of capturing the changes to the initial design document and this results in the initial design quickly being abandoned as a source while this is of course a waste of our documents are and the best way to track changes in those documents will probably be adding a changelist to the top of the document and making the changes in the text in parallel not really an option think as looked at requirements management but that looks way to the documents could be stored in subversion but i think that is a bit too low level to give insight in the anyone know a good way to track changes like these and keep the design document a valuable resource throughout the at the moment we mostly rely on changes to the original design being put in the that way they are at least related version control applicable in document changes to a design

am reading files in various formats and languages and i am currently using a small encoding library to take attempt to detect the proper encoding pretty but it still misses of my potential users have very little understanding of encoding best i can hope for is has something to do with and are very unlikely to be able to choose the right encoding in a so i would like to let them cycle through different encodings until the right one is found just by clicking on a click here to try a different the concept would be the best way to implement something like looks like i express myself clearly by through the i mean to loop through i meant was to let the user try different encodings in sequence without reloading the idea is more like say the file is loaded with the wrong some strange characters are the user would click a button or and the string would be converted in a different the user just need to keep clicking until the right encoding is encoding looks good for the user will do as long as the user can click he has a reasonable chance of solving his i have found so far involves converting the string to bytes using the current then converting the bytes to the next converting those bytes into then converting the char into a but i wonder if there an easier way to do if there was a method that would read a string and return it using a different something like a lot for the cycle through

am trying to place an action to happen after an entire page the is a function that uses the response object to send a file to the detailed am trying to replicate the behavior of a link on the from a i have a link on the main page for the export and it works fine since the page is already displayed before the user clicks but when the user is on a clicks the it should take them back to this main page and then send the file after it did some research and thought that using the pagecomplete event would be for so i created my event handler and put the call to the export code keys off of a query string when loaded from the inside my pagecomplete event but it behaves just the same way the browser download box pops up and the page is never loaded before or it helps to understand what doing here is a snippet of the code used to send the list to the would prefer a way to use a page event to load the rather than tinkering with this if there is a clean and easier way to get the file and it allows for loading the page then sending the that would be fine there another page event i can use besides or is it possible i am missing sorry about the i realize that i change the way http requests work only looking for an acceptable solution that achieves more or less the same it seems like the way to go is to force a refresh of the page after a couple of seconds ensuring that it loads before the file download code is so i am looking for a way to do this as the first answer suggests refresh to a have to be delayed if a way to refresh with no this code private void if if if supposed to after page loading is do a reloading itself with a different query when it reaches the page loadcomplete event the second time it will trigger the function which writes out the it actually apparently repeats the same problem it goes back to the same how do you execute an action after the page or wait until the page completely finishes then trigger a refresh which will execute the is there no way for to do something by itself without the user clicking on the then an after 2 seconds would also be but not sure how to do pagecomplete event troubles and file

am trying to understand how to implement a code coverage tool using the win32 debugging thinking has been to utilize the debugging to launch a process in debug mode and track what cpu instructions has been after having tracked all cpu instructions i would then use the map file to map it to what source code lines were far as i there would be two ways of knowing what cpu instructions have been be to launch the process in debug mode set all threads in single step mode and let the debugging app note all instructions that has been executed be make a more intelligent approach where you would know a lot more about x86 instructions and basically replace the next branch instruction with a then keeping track of the delta instructions between the two new suggested approaches inspired by with the map file and insert breakpoints for the beginning of each line and let the debug framework be notified every time a breakpoint with the map file binary instrumentation to insert a that get called at entry of each source line avoiding the callback through the debugger a vm technology such as vmware to find out what instructions in a particular process was executed i fully understand this someone validate one of the approaches above or maybe suggest an alternative please note that the use case is code coverage and not performance profiling thus we need to know if each single source line is primary goal no particular plan is in would be to create a simple code coverage tool for delphi to implement a code coverage tool using win32 debugging

am writing a linq provider to a hierarchal data i find it easiest to design my api by writing examples showing how i want to use and then coding to support those use thing i am having trouble with is an way to express or recursion in a linq in other what is the best way to distinguish item in where select item in where select please note neither of those examples above necessarily reflect the structure of the query i i am interested in good way to express i am not asking how to implement such a or how to write my iqueryable or ienumerable in such a way that allows i am asking from the standpoint of a person writing the linq query and utilizing my provider what is an intuitive way for them to express whether they want to recurse or data structure resembles a typical file a folder can contain a collection of and a folder can also contain a collection of so represents all the folders who are immediate children of and contains all the items immediately within a basic example of a site much like a filesystem with folders and i item in where select is the most intuitive way to express an intent that the query get all items underneath light or only the immediate the way to distinguish between the two goal is to be able to turn this linq provider over to other developers who have an average understanding of linq and allow them to write both recursive and list queries without giving them a tutorial on writing recursive given a usage that looks i can code the provider against am really sucking at communicating this linq provider is to an external it is not simply walking an object nor in this specific case does a recursive actually translate into any kind of true recursive activity under the just need a way to distinguish between a query and a what do you think is the best way to express or is there a standard way of expressing it that missed out recursion in

applicitations written to your original api will continue to work with the new way to add new features while at the same time making sure that old applications continue to run is to have two versions of an api suppose you currently have a function that takes 2 parameters in the api but you decide the new version really should take 3 keep the way it is and add a new function which takes 3 way users can continue to code against for backward compatibility or use the new function if they require the new technique has been commonly used bu microsoft for the windows

applies to the expression or block after the dont have a so your while ends with the expression after that happens only no reason to new up a as never using the dog you you immediately assign a dog from the array to your dog if you need to get a value for a you should use a not an this was donwmodded from further question with regards to not having to make a new instance of a if i am just taking out copies of the objects from the array how can i then take it out from the array list without having an object in which i put i just noticed as well that i bracket the java reference and the object it refers to are different very much like a reference and though a java reference can be like a upshot is that or dog gives you a reference that points to no an object that can be pointed that with a means that the reference now points to the dog reference returned by in objects are never only references to objects are addresses of the object in of the dog you newed up is now as no code refers to as the referent was replaced with the referent you got from eventually the java garbage collector will destroy that in have the upshot is that you do need to create a variable that can refer to a you need to create a dog with truth you need to create a as what you really ought to be doing is returning what a map returns from its if the map parametrized on like then need to cast the return from but you need a or if the map is and that one line is your whole and be faster than iterating an array for most

approach i generaly use is to copy images to a folder and keep the relative urls in the the downside to this approach is that if someone deleted the images you end up with not in your web pages unless you check everytime you render a	
approach is a bit more putting the filter parameters in tables and then using group having and count to filter the used this basic approach several times for some very sophisticated and it works very well me also join on the artist and venue dimension tables get the results as needing and then join the results on the artist and venue tables to get those dimension search for the entity in a sub then in an outer query get the dimension values you keeping them separate should improve table table into id from name in into id from name in as as as as on as on on as on between and interval 1 from from on a netbook and suffering for so leave out the outer query getting the artist and venue names from the artist and venue tables option would be to filter the and tables in whether this is worth it depends on how influential the join on the concert table my assumption here is that there are many artist and but once filtered on the concert table filtered by the the number of decreases there is often a to deal with the case where no are from experience it is better to deal with this that use if statements and queries specially suited to those a single sql query can be written to handle but is much slower than the programatic writing similar queries several times may look messy and degrade but the increase in complexity need to get this to be a single query is often harder to similar layout could filter concert by artist as filter results by venue as join results on dimension tables to get etc inner inner group inner inner group cascading the each subsequent filtering has a reduce set it has to work this may reduce the work done by the group by having section of the for two levels of filtering i would guess this to be unlikely to be original may still be more performant as it benefits additional filtering in a different in your there may be many artist in your date but few which meet at least one there may be many venues in your date but few which meet at least one before the group all concerts are eliminated the meets none of the the venue meets none of the criteria you are searching by many criteria this filtering also where venues artists share a lot of the filtering also when would i use the or when would i use the cascaded original few search criteria and are from each cascaded lots of search criteria or tend to be similar	
approach is just press continue on the message and keep if in test it outside of a debug	
approach is to add a method to your class and just let the method of arraylist do all the string return make registration get one car per line in the but it is quick and easy if you just want to see what is in the cars would be something like	
approach sounds good to me controls are designed to help you reuse i think a set of usercontrols would work just fine	
approach taken is too move the code out of the event handlers essentially placed a class next to the which implements the event handlers and holds the ui state beside the this move i have gained a pretty clear seperation of the form and the actual interaction with the remaining app and was able to introduce tests at that another result of this was that the view becomes passive pretty refactor the presenter now holds the event in a seperate step and introduce domain objects only after moved all uses of these objects out of all my steps would the ui dependency from the domain objects not available the presenters to use the domain services according to your design choice while at i did this i started introducing tests at the newly introduced boundaries to ensure that not breaking working code or to find bugs in the existing code	
approach used successfully in the past uses a manual reset event and asynchronous invocations to detect when the user has stopped the code looks something like use manual reset event to q up waiting each new text changed event clears the only the last changed will hit the triggering the manualresetevent tbdelay void textchangedeventargs sendorpostcallback actiontorunwhenuserstopstyping o open the resetevent to discard these let all pending through the close the callback check how we via timeout or bool timedout if	
approach you be sure to do some thorough testing if there is any chance that your web application relies files or dirs having certain while allowing too permissive permissions is probably bad this does happen so you might break the the	
approach you could take would be to use json as a protocol between parent and child since json support is readily available in many and is fairly you could also use a pipe to send an arbitrary amount of data down to the child assuming your requirements allow you to have the child scripts read from standard for the parent could do something like here is a sketch of a child imagine this were written in a different this trivial the output	
approaches come to set the server to be optimized for file this used to be in the properties for file printer but seems to have gone away in windows this is set via the registry as ensure that both endpoints are either windows or windows there are significant performance improvements in smb as well as the ip stack which improve performance this may not be an option due to organizational or procurement lead but i thought mention as

are a couple of issues i can see firstly the word index is reserved so in your function you should use secondly in the update statement provided your where clause should be 1 not id i have recreated your table and function using the following delimiter drop function if exists create function 30 returns declare r select into from where and return delimiter using the following update statement correctly updates set where this is just a once off update you could do it more efficiently with a temporary table mysql allow tables to join to themselves in an update temporary table tmp maxvalue1 into tmp as by tmp set should update all rows

are a ton of really good suggestions but there is one minor thing i see that like to comment database are you as someone who spends a ton of time on mysql the thing that jumps out at me is the or mysql can be stupid with seen it be faster to do two selects and union them your row count is large the not that could be a agree with the other indexes should make it and often better to let the db do it rather than handle it the db knows what unless you have a really big data set and want to shift the sorting burden to the client the db can take more let the db do the sorting

are considering migration as one reason is but another reason is that vault does not use valid xml for its commit comments so special characters fail our automated ccnet build system a bullet character is one of and specifically causes us a a way around this has been to ask our developers to not use these characters outside the range of ascii 32 and to manually go in and code with a this may not seem like a big but not allowing these characters prevents easy of bug and other comments into the commit this slows people down and anything that hinders flow and productivity and creates frustration needs to be reduced or my it seems that there is no way to directly migrate from vault to perhaps it is possible to use another version control system as a migration middle vault othersourcecontrolproduct i think that we would either script the commits joshua suggested at the beginning of this or which more likely just commit the last few revisions and leave the vault repos around a while for this actually gives us a a good opportunity to clean out and refactor our current code and

are many forms of leaks that allocates unmanaged leaks that allocates and uses unmanaged like lifetime of understanding of how gc and memory management in the first two is usually handled by two different pieces of idisposable on the object and disposing of the unmanaged in the dispose a to make sure unmanaged resources are deallocated when gc has found the object to be eligible for is you are using a big list holding thousands of totalling a significant size of if you keep around a reference to this list for longer than you need you will have what looks like a memory in if you keep adding to this so that it grows with more data and old data is never you definitely have a memory source of this seen frequently is to attach methods to event handlers but forget to unregister them when slowly bloating the event handler both in size and code to an incorrect understanding of how memory management works can mean that you look at the memory usage in a process viewer and notice that your app keeps growing in memory if you have lots and lots of memory gc might not run that giving you an incorrect picture of the current of as opposed to mapped only seen one resource management bug in so far and afaik it has been slated for fix in it was with copying the desktop screen into a in response to the question in the how to avoid keeping references longer than then the only way to do that is to to just me if you have a method it might be processing files on or downloading or and you used a reference to a big early in the before the and then you use that data structure for the rest of the then in not running under a is smart enough to know that this though it is held in a variable that is technically in is eligible for garbage the garbage collector is really aggressive in this in and running under a it will keep the reference for the life of the in case you want to inspect it when stopped at a if the reference is stored in a field reference in the class where the method is not so since impossible to determine whether it will be reused later or at least very very if this data structure becomes you should clear the reference holding to so that gc will pick it up

are right in your examination and as far as i can tell there is really no direct solution to the problem the reasons lies in the nature of inheritance among which has only a vague resemblance of inheritance among inherited interfaces is a brand new that has some methods in common with the interface it inherits but no direct so by choosing not to implement the base class you are making a specific assumption that the compiled program will timplementation does not implement think is somewhat of a interface extension makes more a common practice is to have a base class implementing the base and than derived classes implementing the extended but in case you want a separate class that implements both simply list those it there a specific reason you want to avoid just you like should even hard type cast an when you do on an interface it will adjust the object vtable pointers in the right if you do a hard cast have methods to you code can easily my impression is that you are treating interfaces like objects inheritance and casts in the same while their internal working is really

are three approaches commonly taken in building a chat applet either find or build a java applet that communicates to a chat the applet can be an irc or a chat client with a custom even seen some websites use a java applet as a communication where the interface is all run by javascript and html in the but the javascript sends and accepts events from the applet to run the every time a use writes a send the message to the http where all the users connected are periodically polling for new using mainly each client establishes a connection to an http and when a message is being sent from the it is send over the already and instead of polling for new messages from other users just flow down the same i find the 3rd option to be the most but the most complex as you will probably need to build your own version of an http server to support the connection that comet and since a 16bit limit on the descriptors of sockets in be limited to about 64k per on your each client will need a open the techniques for building comet code are wildly different between there exist a few frameworks for but have to maintain them while new browsers come running a small and you want to face a surmountable then just go with ajax not too and learn a if you be then just find a java once configured with a matching never have to worry about maintaining since that solution is very of it requires that the java runtime environment be installed on the and not always going to be

are two separate problems do you maintain local forks of remote do you keep a copy of remote projects in your own 1 is pretty easy by just do something clone remote add upstream remote rm remote add origin push can then work on your forked repository when you want to merge in upstream pull upstream for problem one option is to use for cd into your main and submodule add i use git what do i need to may find git submodules to be a little bit tricky at here are some things to keep in commit the submodule before committing the push the submodule before pushing the sure that the head points to a branch before committing to a bash i recommend using to put the current branch name in your run submodule after switching branches or pulling can work around to a certain extent by using an alias created by one of my config pull git submodule update then git submodules are so what are the can check out the main project without checking out the this is useful when the submodules are and you need them on certain you have experienced git possible to have multiple forks of your and link them with different forks of your main somebody might actually fix git submodules to work more the deepest parts of the submodule implementation are actually quite just the tools that are submodules for what you want to use git you might want to look into subtree this keeps everything in one if the upstream repository uses is pretty easy if you know how to use git svn clone remote add origin push set up a local tracking branch in push origin checkout to merge from svn merge tested this but how we maintain one submodule with an upstream svn use git svn because it will make it very difficult to use git submodule in the parent project without losing just treat the subversion branches as mirrors of and merge from them you need to access the upstream subversion repository on another svn init svn should then be able to merge changes from upstream as

are undoubtedly better than just firing up phpmyadmin and changing the schema i did during my php but after using them for i think fatally control is a solved the main function of migrations is to keep a history of changes to your but storing a different file for each change is a clumsy way to track you create a new version of a file representing the when you want to add a new attribute why should you create a new migration when you want to add a new another just as you check into version why not check into version control and make the changes to the file is functionally the same as keeping a file for each but much easier to work my mental model is want table x to have such and such columns i want model x to have such and such why should you have to infer from this how to get there from the existing just open up and give table x the right even the idea that classes wrap tables is an implementation why i just open up and class you went with a model like have to make a decision about what to do with existing but even migrations are overkill when you migrate going to lose fidelity when you use a my question if you think of a better migrations kind of use database migrations instead of a version controlled

arguments are handled by the shell assume you are using bash under so any terminal settings should not affect since you already have quoted the argument it ought to the only possible explanation i can think of is if your command is a wrapper script and messes up the escaping of the arguments when passing on to the real this is easy to or perhaps a bit hard to do correct wrapper script should pass all its arguments on as any other version is most likely a bug with regards to being able to handle embedded spaces this is not uncommon to do however also any occurrences of or similar are troublesome and must be written as possibly in order to handle embedded spaces and this is sinned against a reason for the not so intuitive syntax is that the original joined all arguments as which did not work for embedded then was introduced that expanded to for all parameters and if no parameters are given it should expand to unfortunately some unix vendor messed up and made expand to even in case of no and to work around this the clever not so hack of writing was making only expand if parameter is set avoiding expansion in case of no my wrapper assumption is wrong you could try to debug with outfile java find out what arguments are passed to example from running 93 vars enoent such file or enoent such file or enoent such file or enoent such file or	
array is an array of it is not an array of buffers of some if you do will get the sizeof of the first element of that equivalent your array stores in the line that allocate 4 or 8 pointers in one array on how wide a pointer on your platform usually either 4 or but of course not what you wanted to do is create an array of pointers of the same size as you will have to first get the total size of the animals and then divide by the size of one that is what you but the pointers will yet have indeterminate next you pass the array using for the why you can pass taking its address and then dereference is the same as doing nothing in the first in the function you you copy the strings pointed to by elements in to some indeterminate destination the elements of the array the pointers have yet indeterminate we have not assigned them you first have to allocate the right amount of memory and make the elements point to now after this the pointer points to something animal animal no need to dereference the forget to increment animals about the sizeof one important thing you have to be sure the way we calculate the whatever you make sure you always have enough room for your a c string consists of characters and a terminating null which marks the end of the should point to a buffer that is at least as large so that it contains space for animal and the first contains 11 the second depends on what we actually copy over its length is what in total we for all characters including the terminating now not good style to hardcode that number into your the prefix could change and you could forget to update the number or miscount about one or two that is why we use which we provide with the string literal we want to have recall that a expression evaluates to the size of its you use it in to get the total size of your array now you use it for the string all string literals are arrays of string literals consist of the characters you type to the null the following condition because counts the length of a c and does not include the terminating null character to its would have the type of 4 have to divide by the size of one because the sizeof char is one so it make a why do we use instead of because it already accounts for the terminating null and it evaluates at compile the compiler can literally substitute the size that the sizeof expression

as much a learning exercise as anything then take an iterative build build my rough guideline with the structure of a website and concentrate on the notepad and build a bunch of static pages for your hand code try to build all your pages with no table then play around with some javascript to bring things to calendar learn about how to import and link to javascript and css and how these files are treated to learn up to the limits of what you can do on the client factor in the nuances of browsers and client side start looking for what you might want to change across what needs to be manipulated server and pick a server side with basic forget databases at this learn how your framework of choice maintains not just the name of the technology but the real nuts and bolts of one of your single greatest assets as a web developer is understanding the state of the technology go for a deep dive on the web server technology of choice in understand the full request pipeline from client to server and this will teach you http and its web filters and server to framework hand page and control life back to the start working on dynamic content injection and the how to make and use reusable components in your web performance and get into into all the fun stuff like replace your javascript with you got the whole side of things to the web for client side going to the sites of companies who make third party web controls can be quite asking how the hell they did viewsource is your look at how they structure and build their pick a couple of good web designer and you find a plethora of rants about browser wars etc that will give you good the you hit server go for white paper type learning from your vendor of choice for your again find a 3rd party site used to use a lot of guys from for that will demonstrate how to do various language learning is basically just do the best you can till you find a better and always be on the lookout for a better

asked this question on the zfforums as but i maybe get a response the zend framework is a general loosly high quality i find some of the mvc parts inconsistent and overly hopefully some of you can justify some of the zf design decisions and answer some zend mvc follow the same naming conventions as other zend for mvc uses lower plural directory names and class names prefixed with directory info so they be easily like the option to add a module root that i have to explicitly configure the dispatcher by adding be able to drop in a module and have it accessible is there a distinction between view and action the helpers designed to be shared throughout the code and there are inconsistent methods of loading and accessing the other frameworks allow you to share the same helpers anywhere in your i see the need to specialize and violate view do views use to access i see the need for the extra some other frameworks an array of view variables and allow loading global functions or autoloading static helpers from within the do view helpers only allow one function per that results in a lot of classes and associated prefer static classes with any number of methods as already framework mvc	
asking for seems to be basically a graph distance algorithm data computed from a set of pairwise a reasonable nicely metric is can be thought of construct a graph where each node is a and each edge represents the relevancy of the nodes it connects to each now imagine that starting at some node in the graph and randomly jumping to other nodes along defined say that the probability of jumping from skill a to skill b is proportional to the relevancy of those skills to each other by the relevancy of those to other skills now the commute time represents the average number of steps it takes to make it from skill a to skill has a very nice property that adding more paths between two nodes makes the commute time if skill a and b and c and and d and a are then the commute time between a and c will get shorter commute time can be computed quite easily using an eigenvalue decomposition of your sparsely connected skill graph think the reference i gave you shows but if not there are many you want to actually store the commute time between any pair of skills need a or nxn matrix is the number of a far nicer is as stated drop all connections weaker than some then store a sparsely connected graph as rows in a and i hope this

back some xml for presumably to update the model or the strength of wicket is that you have to worry about the rendered in you set up the controller to correctly modify the and wicket takes care of the separation is not in fact you can view or change and that can be seen as altering the what you generally have to do is directly manage the browser or wicket takes care of if you take care of making your changes in the java the ajax will call a method on your ajaxbehavior with an ajaxrequesttarget that method in methods called from you do whatever you need to updating models or and then you add to the target any view component that that has wicket takes care of updating the an taken from some code i but just to make explication the idea is dropdown where the options in the child change when the select option in the parent as in the series of the actual the model change is passed to the which decides for itself if it has and adds itself to the target if it then passes the target to its removed most of that to make a clearer the which just adds to itself an anonymous subclass of an elided for ajax work without new public void ajaxrequesttarget tell child to update its based on newly selected when the ajax is my owning is already note we could just type making explicit that calling on the enclosing class a inner class has a hidden ref now add the child to the wicket javascript will receive the new options and the child could also have hidden or or added behaviors like css or even swapped one panel for as long as for each changed component called so that the javascript can find added it to the that different types of ajax behavior have different callback so be sure overriding the right one an annotation so the compiler can complain if you got the name the basic wicket idea is that instead of sending raw data for the client to parse and act you update your model and and tell wicket to what by adding the chnaged components to the only reason i can think of to send straight xml would to be to feed it to let me know if your and i completely missed the

been going through head first design patterns came in and i was reading about the strategy and it occurred to me that it might be a great way to implement a common way of calculating taxes on all of the particular objects i use at but i had a question about what i was interface decimal provincialtaxrate canadian decimal public decimal provincialtaxrate public provincialtaxrate new public decimal return provincialtaxrate subtotal federaltaxrate public decimal provincialtaxrate public provincialtaxrate new public decimal return provincialtaxrate subtotal federaltaxrate may have noticed that there is no declaration of federaltaxrate and what i wanted to where should that it in to the constructor for each concrete itax seems redundant and would allow for incorrect behaviour tax calculators must share the exact same federal tax creating a member of itax would allow them to be inconsistent as all tax calculators inherit from some other class where defined statically as well as class public static decimal federaltaxrate new with strategy

been on a team that uses the fj and i know of on one team it was used as a replacement for a library that was less on another it replaced google i also know some folks that copycat the source code from fj to roll their own my if you must use you should be using something like functional java to make your life it increase code quality or written in a functional style is more hence more the library comes and encourages the use immutable data which improves the library also encourages composition over which improves the reusability of your developers with more powerful tools are more in my experience developers feel that functions make programming easier and more happy programmers are productive potential points of more functional style of programming discourages mutable which eliminates a large class of more powerful abstractions lead to less which reduces the number of places where something is no reason to believe that performance would be impacted one way or the the provided datastructures are designed for ease of use and expressiveness rather than but written optimally for what they as with anything how you drive is more important than what for is a linked so it has random access and therefore you avoid it for those has by

been teaching a class on unit refactoring and so and this is probably the thing that most people get refactoring is just changing the it is changing the code without changing the external functional that is a very important other you need to have some way to verify that the external functional behavior is intact after the lacking divine insight i find unit tests very useful for in his book on martin fowler stresses the use of automated tests for this your code was developed using tdd you will have the necessary test suite as it is developed during the development of the code if you need to refactor code for which no tests are your best approach would be to set up automated tests before you make any changes to the i realize that setting up tests for existing code can be but you will learn a lot about the code while doing may also want to check essay on strong typing versus strong as it discusses the feedback you get from the compiler versus the feedback you get from your test

believe your problem is that you use blocking sockets and not you use blocking sockets and you send 1m of data the network stack can wait for all of the data to be placed in a if the buffers are full be blocked and your progress bar will wait for the whole 1m to be accepted into the this may take a while and your progress bar will be however you use whatever buffer size you use will not and you will need to do the waiting yourself with is the most portable in this way your progress bar will be updated fast and reflect the most accurate note that at the sender the progress bar is partially broken any way since the kernel will buffer some data and you will reach before the other side really received the the only way around this is if your protocol includes a reply on the amount of data received by the others second guessing the os and the network is mostly if you keep using blocking sockets pick a size that is large enough to include more data than a single packet so that you send too little data in a packet as this will reduce your throughput go with something like 4k to include at least two packets at a

best i can think of with is the this tells to run as many jobs as possible in you want to limit the number of concurrent jobs to you can sure the dependencies are correct so run jobs it have thing to take into account is optimizations that does with the you can specify various levels of the higher the the longer the compile and link a project i work with runs takes 2 minutes to link with and half a minute with you should make sure not optimizing more than you need you could build without optimization for development builds and with optimization for deployment with debug info will probably increase the size of your executable and may impact your build if you need try removing it to see if it affects type of linking should make a as far as i understand static linking takes longer i may be wrong you should see if this affects your

best practice for a flex application is to create a utility class to manipulate instances of a class rather than to change the prototype of that for you might create a class with static functions that accept objects as the reason you want to follow this best practice is that flex uses the strict setting by and trying to access functions added to the prototype of a sealed class will throw compiler the turning off strict is not advisable because the compiler will not be able to optimize your code as well as it could under strict

best suggestion is probably what parashift but read my caution note below as well parashift faq how can i handle a that an have a return so not possible to use the best way to constructor failure is therefore throw an if you the option of using is to put object into a state setting an internal status bit so object acts sort of like even though it is technically idea of a object has lot of you need to add query member function check this bit so users your class can find out if object is truly or if zombie a and just about every place construct one of your within a larger object an array of you need to that status flag via an if also want to add an if to other member if the is a do a or something more practice the thing pretty certainly you prefer exceptions over zombie but if you do not have the option using zombie objects be the word of caution with throwing exceptions in a very careful though because if an exception is thrown in a the destructor is not so you need to be careful about destructing objects that you already constructed before the exception is the same warnings apply to exception handling in but it is maybe a little less obvious when dealing with a virtual after exception is d public p new throw so p causes a memory char char b p new return constructors with createinstance way around this is to make your constructor private or protected and make a createinstance method that can return	
best thing about scrum is exactly the fact that skills do get a bit the point is to avoid silos at all costs by spreading specialist knowledge across the team and letting people work a bit outside their comfort this is not for some developers are happy in their own narrow specialist field and such people are more of a hindrance in a scrum process than an whereas and people who are determined to get the job usually adapt very very well to it and are far more of the key benefits of scrum is to get the whole team actually involved and invested into the project instead of tackling their own special tasks and then riding off to the claim that for most this is a far more rewarding way of working than the conveyor belt of waterfall advise to boldly embrace the mixing of skills and having people come together to take down nasty problems instead of relying on specialist the result of teams consisting of motivated people can be

biggest challenge with a lot of the billing systems is that you either end up with a lot of coding to do or they come up short with one or more critical systems such as paypal handle externally driven recurring billing for security you as a customer can agree to a subscription from a but paypal has to handle everyone having to have a paypal or googlecheckout account to conduct business may be a depending on your the traditional merchant systems like authorizenet and linkpoint give you more but you might have a lot of coding to do to push the transactions through the way you depending on your not to mention more overhead in setting up the account in the first flexible payments stands somewhere in the offering more flexibility than but still having the third party account since doing a tool that manages relationships to their you may benefit from ability to facilitate transactions between two external done development in this space using java or ruby on ruby on rails has a wonderful gem built by the people at shopify called that makes credit card processing pretty simple once you have opened your merchant account with one of the type of most of the merchant providers have decent java apis as you may want to look at something like for since it lets you put together pretty invoices and has an cloud a big fan and it lets you manage the costs of scaling more it does require in many cases that you solve problems of clustering and failover more for tasks such as batch billing that can be run through something like amazon this an you bring up what you throw it in the black and get the result for something that requires continuous such as the web you will want to evaluate whether be cheaper to run a cluster of webapp servers in the cloud or just run 1 or 2 boxes at a managed data center such as the planet or the right answer for you depends in part on the expertise you have available and the for the continuous uptime you may also want to look at a provider such as that will host a rails app in the reply if anything i said requires further

calculate the probability of collisions with strings of length with bits per character to a hash of length bits assuming an optimal you could calculate the collision probability based on a hash table of size of things first we can assume a ideal hashtable implementation that splits the bits in the hash perfectly into the available buckets this means becomes meaningless except as a limit for and are simply the basis for an upper bound for for simpler maths assume that strings length are simply padded to l with a special null if we were interested we are interested in the worst case this is plainly this is a ludicrous the actual number of entries is more useful than the character set and the length so we will simply work as if was a variable in own are left trying to put items into then becomes a very well known the this for various probabilities and number of buckets is but assuming we have 1 billion buckets about 4gb of memory in a 32 bit then we would need only 37k entries before we hit a chance of their being at least one given that trying to avoid collisions in a hashtable becomes plainly this does not mean that we should not about the behaviour of our hash clearly these numbers are assuming they are an upper bound on how good we can a poor hash function can give far worse collisions in some waste some of the possible by never or rarely using it all of which can cause hashes to be less than optimal and even degrade to a performance that looks like a list but with much constant implementation of the hash function is not great that it could be but is probably acceptable for the vast majority of users and is reasonably efficient to alternative perfect you wish you can generate what are known as this requires full knowledge of the input values in advance however so is not often in a simliar vein to the above maths we can show that even perfect hashing has the limit of of 54 strings of length however we only have bits shall assume which is about 4 billion different so if you can have truly string and any number of them then you have to l 2 solving log2 54 32 log2 54 string lengths clearly be you are left with a maximum length of just very short you know that you will only ever have a set of strings well below 4 billion in size then perfect hashing would let you handle any value of but restricting the set of values can be very hard in practice and you must know them all in advance or degrade to what amounts to a database of string hash and add to it as new strings are this exercise the universal hash is optimal as we wish to reduce the probability of collision for any input the probability of it having output x from a set of possibilities r is that doing an optimal job on the hashing the internal is quite hard but that you should expect the built in types to be reasonable if not always this example i have avoided the question of closed and open this does have some bearing on the probabilities involved but not

calling a method through a null pointer or reference is strictly speaking undefined but it may succeed unless the call is virtual methods virtually a not from the derived class with way of always fails if the is null because virtual calls require access to vtable and accessing the vtable through a null is so you call an empty virtual method through a understand this you need to know more about how code is for every method a section of code segment containing the machine code implementing the a call is done from a derived class or a method through a the compiler knows exactly which method to call so it just inserts a call to an exact portion of code and passes pointer as the first parameter in case of calling through null pointer will be null but you care if your method is a call is done virtually a the compiler know which exactly method to it only knows that a table of virtual methods and the address of the table is stored in the in order to find what method to call necessary to first dereference the get to the get the address of method from it and only then call the reading the table is done in not during if the is null you get segmentation fault at this also explains why virtual calls be the compiler simply has no idea what code to inline when looking at the source during

can understand the i have been there so share how i keep the basic differences a class method then it using the if you choose to from that keyword is intended to evoke the idea that the method may or may not be the actual method i always think of members as meaning that it represents functionality that can be such as an method on a which might involve eating with a class might override the of in order to allow for an implementation that uses chop sticks because virtual methods and properties are the class that defines that member must provide a complete implementation of the method or all objects must how way of thinking might declare that members represent to is an of a class a may to with chop a class method then it overridden using the if you choose to that keyword is intended to evoke the idea that the class only the capability represented by the and that there is not any common logic that can be generalized for that in other members are only and therefore they lack an it is a little confusing that asks us to abstract members when we implement an inheritance but in this case it really means that we are overriding the empty concept with a concrete an example of an member of a class might be there would not be a common way of speaking for all nor is it because it requires language to some might argue that belongs on an way of thinking might declare that members represent behavior be and knowledge or beliefs be to is a behavior of a class a may learn to differently than an and neither knows how to just because they are both methods do not need to be is no such thing as a members can only appear on in the above having an method on the class implies that is an and a cannot be instantiated using the phrase baby new the class should inherit from and it should be instantiated as baby new because a is a and and both also inherit from could inherit from instead of being is because we are all something more than simply members cannot be only their implementations may be up the inheritance for must implement the method as an if inherits from it may then hide the implementation of with its own implementation by using the keyword hiding in reference classes can have a main distinction between an and an in that an class can define both a contract and a template of the whereas an only defines a class versus rahman hiding in chetan

canonical solution for this is to use a block in the top and the full node in content most basic way of achieving this is to simply display the node page normally with a theme having the content top region zen classic create a views block containing the list you want and place it in that you can use the path as the argument to the view so its contents can depend on the currently displayed define the visibility of the block to only match the conditions you probably to display only on node or maybe on node pages of a specific content for use the php visibility mode for the and do something like filter args for return return way the block will be displayed only when you want your theme does not have this panels provide a way for you to divide the page and place the view in one panel and the full node in an other

choose whether to use an sql database based on how much data i wanted to store i would choose based on of data i wanted to store and how it is to be defines a database database is a structured collection of records or data that is stored in a computer and i think your answer lies if you want to store records such as customer access rights and so on then a db such as mysql or sqlite or whatever is not they give you a tried and trusted mechanism for managing those on the other your website stores and delivers unchanging content such as mp3s and so on then simply storing them in a directory layout on a disk is more than i would also include xml documents if you had for example a production department that created articles for a website in xml format there is no need to put them in a db store them on disk and use xslt to deliver choice of sql or not will also depend on how the content you wish to store is to be sql is obviously good for retrieving many records based on search criteria whereas a directory xml rdf etc are more likely to be used to retrieve single of storage mechanism is very important when trying to scale site and stuffing everything into a sql db will quickly become a

class needs a reference to the form for this to the reason for this is that the form is not a static class so you can have multiple instances of best way of giving it the reference would probably be to pass it in the classes then the class would have a reference to the form and could use that reference to change the alternative option that you could use if you are sure that you will have only one instance of your form open is to add a public static property to the forms class that returns the instance of the that property would then be available to be used in your other make sure that your controls are or better add public methods to your form that can be used to manipulate the controls

clean code is easier to bend to your it is possible to design an interface that is simple and mention of hop helps to highlight one of the easiest ways to give huge flexibility to your the ability to pass in a function reference whatever you call it in your language of perl sort function is a perfect example of this pass a code ref and a and get a sorted the code ref works with localized variables and if the code returns comes after return 0 to set an and to put before does the power of this approach come it works so well it encapsulates the the idea behind the visitor pattern is the java is such a verbose language that it costs more to implement and maintain than a bunch of else if else flexibility and simplicity are the result of a good possible to create inelegant crap in any language any design d

client a sends a second message before client b sends a do you print out the second message from client in that not really alternating at just printing whichever messages arrive in the order they do you want to wait a bit to see if a message arrives from client think either want a separate thread for each running in addition to the each client thread constantly tries to read a message from its respective which blocks until it receives a when a socket thread receives a it puts it onto a of which there is one instance for all three this operation will block until the main thread calls on the main thread can simply loop and call on the this will block until one of the client threads calls you want to do alternating you could have two one for each want to introduce some delay in your main to give both clients a chance to write their messages before forwarding it

common and are just two structs that add they are for convenience of creators of function object so they have to do those but they behave what you want is function object comes to const str no error make it a const str no error can take it by value and then return the copy from if use it to apply it to some which would allow the function object to update some state variables among its is an example that does it like i would accept them by value because they are usually small and copying them allows greater so i const str no error will then be able to take a copy of fct and save it and can be and update some members is part of the whole point of remember if you take a function object by const you generally copy because the user could have passed a copying it then will try to locally declare a function instead of a local function accepting will accept a function pointer instead when a function was which can safely be

consideration on the use of custom tags over udfs or cfc methods is when you find that a subroutine needs to be passed an array of child you can use nested custom tags to associate a child custom tag and its elements to a parent custom this allows you to do very nice clean coding thats easy to i know we have nicer dhtml stuff like menus and this is simply to point out an you can use cfassociate in the custom tag to the attributes to the parent custom tag and then in the access all the dynamically generated child items in the array of associated this is where you would loop and output the menu to the screen in this as another allows you to do some clever one thing in particular i use is that i set and then i can essentially force simple html tags the to get kicked through a custom tag handler at runtime so an html tag becomes intelligent at i do this so i can analize the href and the target attributes and decide if i want to display a pdf icon other mime type next to the its pretty this is especially helpful in a content management system or when 7you have html developers using dreamweaver or contribute and you want to have their tags fire smart coldfusion tags without them doing anything outside of standard html the editor doesnt know any difference and they dont need to go into view to make some fairly powerful in a custom tag you can choose to suppress output use a so this can be very useful to wrap around chunck of dynamically generated access the variable in the executionmode eq throw out the baby with the bathwater on this one i agree their usage is much less frequent since we have however there is still some powerful functionality in custom i usually have one or 2 in every application at least dozens of

conversion using the operator is a it will convert both to a common type and compare the way strings are converted to integers is that the you linked contradict check the second where it says that comparing the integer to a string using shall be happens is that the string is converted to and strings that do not contain or begin with a convert to vs string that consists of a or begins with a is considered a if the string has other characters after that these are a string starts with a character that cannot be interpreted as part of a then it is a and will convert to this mean that a numeric string has to start with a digit for example is a numeric string because the minus sign is part of a number in that for your string does not start with a so it would convert to but your second string would be converted to integer so why your second test does not work the same you should probably the use of triple equals instead of a double this ensures that what you are comparing is a string that contains the digit zero and prevents any type

could store the values of the properties of said object in a dictionary and provide access to that dictionary from outside the or use other than that i think of a way to do pretty much no matter the lose type what are you actually trying to might find that the correct way to approach this is to use something like the strategy that way you encapsulate the logic for using the properties into classes that know which properties they then at runtime decide which of those strategy classes to instantiate and pass it your frederik says you could use but again the type safety argument comes and you may find you get runtime errors you legislate for at design

current private implementation is private to everything outside the unit it is declared so if your reasoning for not wanting to add the statements is that you want to modify your existing then you have nothing to gain except breaking any existing code that accesses the class in the same as long as your existing units are not then the difference between and is your reasoning for the behavior is to use the compiler to help you code that takes advantage of the then adding the to one class at a time is a good incremental approach so you can get to a compilable and testable state more a whole sale change of behavior would require fixing every violation before you knew if any of them reason behaves like it does is similar to it allows certain classes procedural to access the and makes heavy use of this so a compiler switch or an all out change would break all of that implementation of is private enough for all practical purposes since typically you control the unit your class is declared if you only ever one class per and never include procedural then the difference is only

database from i would design the application to log from the middle tier and make the decision about which logger type to use at not compile use a factory method to determine whether to log to the data layer does need to log report a have it throw an catch it in the middle tier and then decide how to handle it there or hand it off to a diagnostics class and have that either way keep the dal as as possible and not have it making decisions about what is and what is not a loggable common parent class is not a good a logger is not a and nor is a database a its not so much a chicken and egg problem as it is a cow and a pig they are two different there is no reason for database to be aware of i think you are forcing the all i see is that a logger has a if a db logger that drive the data layer from the middle tier so when including exceptions and i cant see where you would lose fidelity in logging db related public interface void public static class public static iloggingprovider to return your logger public void public class dblogger iloggingprovider void database db new public class public class public void try build your database db new catch

decision process for me is pretty all new development will be done with existing sites that need minor modifications will continue to be existing sites that need major modifications will be candidates to move to basic reason that making the switch has to do with testability and imo mvc web sites are significantly more i can test everything but the view logic with unit tests by using and testing htmlhelper extensions i can even test a fair amount of view with webforms i had to jump through lots of hoops to test codebehind and as a result left a lot of the app for manual also feel that the architecture is simply better from a design because of the clear separation of concerns less tempting to insert business logic in the wrong place the it makes conceptualizing and understanding the application much also able to reuse even view code with less effort because i have extraneous bits of logic from other layers hanging around to get in the only real downside i see at present is that not as mature and you already have as many reusable components built for i expect that to over even though it is possible to intermix mvc with i see retrofitting existing apps as a viable alternative unless there is significant other work to be just my but i would rather start from scratch with mvc than try and get an existing app to work with i suppose it would depend on the size of the but anything with any significant number of pages is going to have a lot of routing

depends entirely on your definition of a single deeply embedded environment without an operating system involved you can usually disable and enable this can be used to allow a function to be atomic against interrupt handler but if you have a a dma or some other hardware device that can write memory then even masking interrupts might not provide a strong enough guarantee in some an rtos time operating the os kernel usually provides low level synchronization primitives such as critical a critical section is a block of code that behaves at least with respect to all other critical it is usually fundamental to the implementation of other synchronization a a low level primitive called a spinlock is often it is used to guard against entry to a block of code that must be atomic with respect to other users of the same spinlock and operates by blocking the waiting cpu core in a tight loop until the lock is released the many threading more complex primitives such as and queues are provided by the threading these cooperate with the thread scheduler such that threads waiting for something to happen run at all until the condition is these can be used to make a actions atomic with respect to other threads sharing the same synchronization general rule would be to use the highest level capabilities available in your environment that are suited to the in the best an existing thread safe object such as a message queue can be used to avoid needing to do anything special in your code at

development team has run into a design hoping someone can help me clean this part of the architecture up a my i have an enum with 250 members member represents a distinct drop in order to populate the drop downs on any given that form sends in the enum members that relate to the drop downs and the drop down information is other say for we have 3 window a has drop downs y and window b has drop downs x and y and window c has drop downs u and my dropdowntype enum would consist of and so for a specified given the drop downs on that i query for the data to appear in those drop is a simplified example because my application consists of 250 distinct drop you can i have a factory setup to return the data for each drop and this factory is called for each drop down switch case return t in select new dropdowndto dropdowndisplayname dropdownvalue case return u in select new dropdowndto dropdowndisplayname dropdownvalue i have so many members in this does anyone know of a more elegant way of coding do you think transforming this into factory methods would be helpful then have to worry about 250 separate files in our is there another pattern out there that is more just having this huge switch statement is getting help is greatly thanks in to handle a massive factory in a cleaner

diagrams do not provide any but i seen a better way to quickly give an overview of all the in the diagrams are useful for showing the classes that are part of each i seldom see them used for that purpose by other they are usually used to throw a bunch of classes on a picture with little rhyme and reason as to why the particular classes are in each the diagrams end up not being very diagrams are the tools absolutely do not support useful usage of sequence diagrams so you have to be somewhat inventive within the limitations of the but i use sequence diagrams to prove that my match my architecture and my design matches my package operations i think there is a more useful most people use probably because it forces you to think about your concept of the component diagram is the uml version is pretty so i usually end up drawing my own diagram using powerpoint or not much of a fan of state or activity i had some bad experiences with other state machine designs early in my career and thus avoid them like the it comes to presenting to a then i use the information from these diagrams but i put it in a format that is easier to understand and at a much higher for presenting to other software developers then these diagrams should be sufficient to convey the required information through usually they do require some narrative text be written in order to be of

did you come to decide on spring python as your api of spring works well on java where a tradition of declarative defining your application primarily using xml to control a core engine is a standard pattern in while the underlying patterns like inversion of control are still apposite on your use the implementation chosen by spring looks like a classic case of something produced by a java programmer who want to learn see the article is not applaud your decision to introduce order and thoughtfulness to your but you may wish to evaluate a number of options before making your in you may find that using spring python will make it difficult to hire good python many of whom will run the other way when faced with xml files describing object start by what you really want to the problem cannot simply be that need a there are lots of frameworks out and hard to evaluate if you truly need one and which one will work if you identified what underlying software problems you need to the real problem is that your code is an unmaintainable introducing a framework probably fix the instead of just messy have code that is messy in someone style perhaps rigour in the dev team is where you should recommend starting good code stringent hiring a luck with the

do this because you end up with a problem who owns the package that almost everything else is a subpackage method of establishing package heirarchy the filesystem does not play well with this convention at java can get away with it because package heirarchy is defined by the structure of the string literals fed to the so there need to be an explicit package also the question of what to do if you want to publicly release a package but own a domain name suitable for bodging into the package or if you end up changing your domain name for some later updates need a different package how do you know that is a newer version of how do you know that a newer if you miss your domain renewal and the name gets snatched by a domain and someone else buys the name from and they want to publicly release software should they then use the same name that you had already names and software package it seems to address two entirely different and have entirely different complicating i personally dislike convention because it violates separation of avoiding namespace collisions is nice and but i hate the thought of my namespace being defined by dependent the marketing interaction with some clarify my point in response to in a package is a directory containing an file presumably one or more module a package hierarchy requires that each package be a legitimate if two packages from different but even packages from the same share a package whether that name is or or or each one provide an for that we must also assume that these packages are likely to be installed in the same place in the directory the filesystem thus enforces that there is only so which one there is not cannot a correct answer to that nor can we reasonably merge the two files since we know what another package might need to do in that subpackages sharing a package cannot be assumed to work when both are installed unless they are specifically written to be compatible with each other least in this one this would be a distribution nightmare and would pretty much invalidate the entire point of nesting this is not specific to package though they provide the most obvious bad example and are philosophically questionable really the practical issue of shared rather than the philosophical that are my main concern the other a single large package using subpackages to better organize itself is a great since those subpackages specifically designed to work and live this is not so common in because a single conceptual package tend to require a large enough number of files to need the extra layer of

do you empty a vase containing five if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing four do you empty a vase containing four if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing three do you empty a vase containing three if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing two do you empty a vase containing two if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing one do you empty a vase containing one if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing no do you empty a vase containing no if the vase is not you take out one but the vase is empty so generalize do you empty a vase containing if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing can we see that in int flowersinvase flowersinvase 0 take one flower flowersinvase 1 else the vase is nothing to we have just done that in a for recursion can be replaced with but often recursion is more talk about in computer a is a structure made up of where each node has some number of children that are also or a is a tree made of nodes that have exactly typically called and again the children can be or a is a node that is not the child of any other that a in addition to its has a a and imagine that we wish to sum all the values in some sum value in any one we would add the value of node itself to the value of its left if and the value of its right if now recall that the if not are also to sum the left we would add the value of child node itself to the value of its left if and the value of its right if to sum the value of the left left we would add the value of child node itself to the value of its left if and the value of its right if anticipated where going with and would like to see some node int root if there is no its sum is root null return 0 else there is a return that instead of explicitly testing the children to see if null or we just make the recursive function return zero for a null say we have a tree that looks like this numbers are the slashes point to and means the pointer points to 4 2 1 we call sumnode on the root node with value we will 5 expand that in everywhere we see replace it with the expansion of the return 5 5 4 5 4 2 null 5 4 2 0 5 4 2 0 1 null 5 4 2 0 1 0 5 4 2 0 1 0 3 null 5 4 2 0 1 0 3 0 0 5 4 2 0 1 0 3 5 4 2 0 1 3 5 4 2 1 3 5 4 3 5 3 5 10 15 see how we conquered a structure of arbitrary depth and by considering it as the repeated application of a composite each time through our sumnode we dealt with only a single using a singe and two simple return statements that almost wrote directly from our to sum a if a node is null its sum is otherwise its sum is its value plus the sum of its left child plus the sum of its right child the power of vase example above is an example of all that means is that in the recursive if we recursed if we called the function that was the last thing we tree example was not tail because even though that last thing we did was to recurse the right before we did that we recursed the left the order in which we called the and added the current value matter at because addition is look at an operation where order does use a binary tree of but this time the value held will be a not a tree will have a special that for any its character comes alphabetical the character held by its left child and alphabetical the character held by its right we want to do is print the tree is alphabetical easy to given the tree special we just print the left then the then right just want to print so pass our function something to print this will be an object with a char we need to worry about how it just that when print is print see that in node char worry about this printer private o void char c out worry about this printer if there is no do root null return else there is a printer value printer root this function returns a printer addition to the order of operations now this example illustrates that we can pass things into a recursive the only thing we have to do is make sure that on each recursive we continue to pass it we passed in a node pointer and a printer to the and on each recursive we passed them if our tree looks like h a j will we we go left where we go left where we go left to where we do nothing and we return to where we print and then go right where we do nothing and we return to a and are we return to where we print and then go right where we go left where we go left to where we do nothing and we return to where we print and then go right where we do nothing and we return to i and are we return to where we print and then go right where we do nothing and we return to j and are we return to h and are return to where we print and then go right n where we go left to where we do nothing and we return to where we print and then go right where we do nothing and we return to n and are so return to k and are so we return to the if we just look at the lines were we we return to where we print and then go right we return to where we print and then go right we return to where we print and then go right we return to where we print and then go right return to where we print and then go right we return to where we print and then go right see we printed which is indeed in alphabetical manage to print an entire in alphabetical just by knowing how to print a single node in alphabetical which was just our tree had the special property of ordering values to the left of alphabetically later knowing to print the left child before printing the and tto print the right child after printing the the power of being able to do whole things by knowing only how to do a part of the whole knowing when to stop that in most operator when its first operand is the general recursive function m

dynamic array is declared the same way regardless of the number of dimensions in lotusscript can have up to 8 according to your example i think it is a two dimensional array you where the first dimension is limited to three you first declare the array as can then specify bounds according to the following 0 to 0 to 9 a two dimensional if you need to enlarge the array later keep all the you can do it like preserve 0 to 0 to 99 keep in mind that only the bounds of last dimension can be changed once the number of dimensions of the array has been

dynamics reports sound like it is for it is a fully programmable reporting component for visual view the documentation on the api you can export the reports to any of our various including and excel and it also includes an end user designer control that you can embed into your own applications to let end users modify or create their own reports are stored in rdl the same xml dialect that reporting services uses in fact you can take any existing rdl files and open them in data dynamics in addition to compatibility with we add many more such as to consistently style your master pages for and several other built in controls such as a and to name a lets look at your requirements and see how data dynamics reports might solve invoked through code dynamics reports includes comprehensive on ideally invoked from code within a can use data dynamics reports in or it even support medium trust applications are report files that contain their own internal data query etc ideally so that we can push simple report files to the and it simply work where maintenance is not necessarily a developer dynamics reports uses standard rdl which includes all information bout how to retrieve data from your we also include an end user designer control to allow you to emebed a design environment for these standalone files into your own data from a database server based on parameters that we pass in dynamics reports includes comprehensive support for parameters get the from a through to pdf or similar dynamics reports supports exporting to and hope it works out for and let me know if you have any additional dynamics grapecity

er we need to know about a team is the name and therefore we need a table to store the seed the only candidate key is team name so we will use that as the primary to keep things ncaa team names are unlikely to change over the course of a single tournament or contain duplicates so it should be an adequate table can be used to pair the teams into each of the match foreign keys to the will ensure that the teams exist and a primary key over these values ensures that teams are only matched up against each other foreign key to the table from the table will record the logically the winner would need to be one of the two teams participating in the match a check constraint against the primary key could ensure the outcome of a match up has been determined the seed could be retrieved from the team table in order to compare against other in order to determine subsequent match upon doing so an fk to the resulting match up can be written to the determining match ups in order to depict the progress of the tournament this data could probably be derived at any also modeled out the games of each match a game is identified by the match up it is a part of and a sequence number based on the order in which it took place during the match games have a winner from the team table score could be recorded in this table as

event is roughly but you can run into performance issues using this event to access rows because of the memory it this is essentially a scheme where the datagridview tries to minimize its memory footprint by sharing some state when possible between rows you access one of the shared which causes it to unshare state and possible performance a lot has been optimized but run into issues with using this event for one reason or if rowsadded works for you with no degradation of if you still have lots of you can derive from the datagridviewcell and datagridview to add custom cell types to the this is probably the most complicated way to customize the but it would allow pretty much any kind of cell manipulation event gives you a hook into the painting of a particular cell if you wish you paint something with before also a event which gives you special event as well but never used that so not sure if the shared memory state issue applies for the painting event it does

every answer has to avoid the declare the function before its and as chris points use the standard mechanisms for accessing the variadic arguments or suffer the pains of undefined this it is not that the declaration before use in this case is required because of the return but rather because it does not match the default signature for an undeclared that a function taking unspecified arguments returning an the actual definition is different from the assumed declaration which causes gcc to say types for second example return because the later definition of contradict the default signature assumed when its first call was but just because it works make it good form because you get almost no type safety from the default to the variadic arguments ones matching the really should be done through the standard mechanisms of unless you are implementing a compiler and are the author of that for on some architectures those arguments may not even be passed on the but they can still be located by the macros from i reworded the second paragraph to say what i meant in a and i hope compiler needs to know that the function is variadic the first call because on some it might be required to pass the variadic parameters differently than normal that is especially true of certain risk and those that might pass the first 2 ints and first 2 floats in but must put all variadics on the stack even if there is room in the similar declare before use situation exists for functions that do not use the calling you will usually run into this when linking modules written in pascal or fortran with modules written in many of the windows api functions exported by the core dlls assume a calling convention named and if the compiler were to use a style the program would crash the whole machine on windows 9x or	
every break on the getting to the root of the exception is very crucial and time taking the web applications are in multi user environment and stateless asynchronous really a tough job to look at the eventviewer log files and root cause an issue reported by the end also it depends on how educated the to explain the issue in came up with a creative way to log the which makes the job easier for the end user and dev will follow a signature to log the exceptions into an xml and which can be processed remotely for viewing or reports on signature of the static method in the error logging class is as number module layer custom with stack know there are many reusable exception handling but what i was looking at is a unique number to track the issue that should get displayed to the end back to the user the exception is expected to handled and consumed then up the developer to show the valid message to the end incase of any unexpected or exception is thrown to the application layer global the response would be cleared and custom message in html will be written back to the user with the unique id like the below an unexpected error has occurred the exception has be recorded for further please use the number to communicate the support team details number this is the unique number generated for every a read only property in the errorlogging class which would be unique per exception this would be concatenation of the initially i thought to use guid but then it would be tough for the end user to remember the guid to report the string strexceptionid get return name this would be a static enum variable with module modulename module3 this would be a static enum variable with priority developer has to decide the priority like if a validation fail of date or integer format use or if its unexpected in a business layer call then use think priority high should be used in only in dal or in business logic layer or like if the interface to sap or ariba enum priority high medium low would be a static enum variable with layer enum layer dataaccess custom message is optional and its upto the developer to supply an information to help explain the reason or empty string can be with stack trace this would the exception object which would be further processed inside the processing done inside the error log method method will additionally get the userid and timestamp and write it to the xml xml logging will enable us to process an use it in any the exceptions can be viewed remotely in a easy to trace and find any we can search sort exception based on priority time stamp we can generate reports module level layer wise priority dependency on the xml if its lost all the exceptions would go for a we can overcome this in two writing the xml to db on timely basis or write this on top of event viewer logging as always have the on the review comments post the xml schema and the aspx page to view and search the take time to review and give ur review comments for my error logging

every tried this setup but i can take a guess at what is going usercotnrols are meant to be loaded by not by you are attempting to create them by notice the difference between how you refer to them in the inner project and how it differs from the outer i believe to get this to work you will need to refer to the path location of the quick search shows how this can be done in vs 2005 but the concept should be the same in vs you can find that information option would be to not use the design surface and instead load the controls using the loadcontrol passing in the path to the important thing to take from the link i mention above is that you must make the files accessable for your outer the above link does this by using a command to copy the files to a sub folder in the outer think of the inner project as if you were going to redistribute you would have to give away not only the but also the for users to consume it they must reference the files and have their project reference your you must do the same thing as hope that is a little

example i can think of is an internal database at my company containing information on all it gets a nightly update from hr and has an web service on many other apps use the web service to populate things like pessimism is that the developer thought that repeated calls to the web service would be too slow to make repeated sql so what did he the application start event reads in the entire database and converts it all to objects in stored indefinitely until the app pool is this code was so it would take 15 minutes to load in less than 2000 if you inadvertently recycled the app pool during the it could take 30 minutes or because each web service request would start multiple concurrent for this new hires appear in the database the first day when their account was created and therefore would not be able to access most internal apps on their first couple twiddling their second level of pessimism is that the development manager want to touch it for fear of breaking dependent but yet we continue to have sporadic outages of critical applications due to poor design of such a simple

excuse my i only started coding in silverlight tried implementing the command pattern in silverlight and hit a say commands are because you can write them into so you can keep your also you have loose coupling between your view and your viewmodel because there is no direct reference to the viewmodel in the can not keep your because you can bind only one command to a and you have to decide which event will fire your command when you bind if a control has 30 you have to choose one for the other 29 will execute the other commands from event handlers from the code coupling can be achieved more simply by dependency commands add a useless layer of indirection that gives nothing they only make it a bit harder to maintain your it is easier to maintain your when you are programming against an interface and see exactly what method gets then when you have to keep jumping between your command definitions and your i miss or commands are really not meant to be used for view and viewmodel see the following this is why i get all the hype with wpf and silverlight command implementations useless for the

exponential distribution has support on the entire positive your distribution has support over the positive integers is a discrete probability and it is called the probabilities are usually written in terms of a parameter that is but a trivial your choice of picking the geometric distribution is a good one when you know just the all discrete probability distributions supported on with given expected value the geometric distribution x with parameter p is the one with the largest problem is interesting to incrementally fill buckets given the distribution of their and i know of the best but assuming there are sufficiently many the following stupid algorithm will there are items pick a k according to the desired for the geometric distribution with mean you could toss a coin with bias until you get a then get for of the for for with k being on average put the next k items into one that you need to know the number of assuming the number is sufficiently issues as variance in the and at the will not matter

general answer is that garbage will tend to be collected less often but the gc pauses will tend to be is assuming you already have more memory available to the vm than your working set otherwise you might be spending a lot of time in garbage gc characteristics vary greatly depending on which collector you are using and which version of and whether you specified a higher in addition to the higher older versions of java did not resize the young generation space after the vm had so even if you specified a really large the size of the young generation would still be really small so you would see frequent young generation a young generation collection there will be some objects that will be promoted to the tenured space even though they are this means that the tenured generation will slowly fill up with dead young requiring periodic full the number of such objects that end up in the tenured generation is proportional to the number of young gcs constant activity in your so the advantage of a larger young generation is that there will be fewer young generation and therefore fewer objects from the young collection will be promoted to the tenured are a number of tuning parameters besides for java and you will have to experiment with them since the optimal settings will vary for each

general there are a lot of good answers that demonstrate distinct data access and business logic one thing i would add on top of that is getting rid of the interfaces for every single writing an interface when you know for sure only ever going to be one class implementing it is and needlessly complicates now if you were writing a class library and were only offering the one class as a template or starting point for then that would be but the interfaces shown here exactly leave a lot of room for	
general way it is done is that the number of references to an object are kept track of in the and when that number goes to the object is subject to garbage however the gc will not fire up until it is explicitly needed because it is an expensive what happens when it starts is that the gc goes through the managed area of memory and finds every object that has no references the gc deletes those objects by first calling their allowing them to clean up after then frees the commonly the gc will then compact the managed memory area by moving every surviving object to one area of allowing more allocations to take i said this is one method that i know and there is a lot of research being done in this

generation and maintenance but it is we have a number of legacy quite different degrees of reports in crystal reports these are designed for not necessarily but to be of a predictable layout and no possibility of us retiring them any time connect to existing stored procedures server to acquire their a lot of time has been sunk in getting these reports to look the actual creation of reports is mostly done via the api and exported to there are a number of locally developed and maintained applications that are stable and handle this process we like the fact that crystal reports is that our apps produce these reports that the pdf output is consistent and that when the crystal reports template is approved and it just are some big problems with this situation the biggest being that any changes to the underlying report templates themselves are a huge getting the crystal reports template to a point that users are happy is a royal hassle and can involve a long iteration of and myriad other that with crystal reports being a relatively rare skill and not one people want to admit we are trying to think up alternative thoughts started to consider and any others crystal reports 2008 offer any benefits over have others managed a migration away from and what the data access layer is well perhaps generate graphs via an excel service and then import them as graphics to a framework another has anyone tried anything like reporting services any have some rs skillz but another thing that people are loath to actually own up to knowing anything there any layout tools available with a for in the old would be called desktop if we have objects as images that could then be rendering i want to move to a solution where the users are in greater control of the underlying and whether this can be handled programatically within tools that we can provide to them and so that i can be coding rather than editing crystal reports crystal whether to what and

george said working effectively with legacy code is the bible for this kind of the only way others in your team will buy in is if they see the benefit to them personally of keeping the tests achieve this you require a test framework with which is as easy as possible to plan for other developers you take your tests as examples to write their if they do not have unit testing expect them to spend time learning a they will probably see writing unit testings as slowing their development so not knowing the framework is an excuse to skip the some time on continuous integration using cruise cdash if your code is automatically compiled every night and tests run then developers will start to see the benefits if unit tests catch bugs before thing to encourage is shared code if a developer changes their code and breaks someone test they should not expect that person to fix their they should investigate why the test is not working and fix it in my experience this is one of the hardest things to developers write some form of unit some times a small piece of code they check in or integrate the make integrating these into the build easy and developers will start to buy approach is to add tests for new and as code is sometimes you cannot add as many or as detailed tests as you would like without decoupling too much existing err on the side of the only place i insist on unit tests is on platform specific where are replaces with platform specific higher level these must be tested on all platforms with the same this saves loads of time adding new use to structure our the simple self registering functions make writing tests are wrapped in ctest of this runs a group of unit tests executables at once and generates a simple nightly build is automated with ant and luntbuild glues and java i hope to add automated deployment and functional tests to the

get a similar effect in unix when you sigstop although this depends on your a i believe it stops the process from executing totally and the address while not swapped to disk en can be paged out discarded if reloadable from the due to will restart the possible solution is something we implemented in unix a while make the program responsible for its own start and by passing a parameter to secondary copies of the program would not do any real only communicate to the primary there were four primary copy with or no this would just start the program and let it primary copy with this would start the program which would initialize then send a sigstop signal to itself to secondary copy with this would send a sigcont signal to the primary copy to start it running secondary copies with no parameter would simply complain that a primary was already running then secondary copy with this would send a sigstop signal to the primary copy to make it used shared memory for communicating with the primary since there were many other things a secondary could pass to the but if all you want is stop and start go for storing the pid in a known file and checking to make sure the process name is gives you a nice idiom for a program that can pause and restart just by seemingly running it again with different

give you some food for thought you could look at something like live not saying the answer for you but the storage model it uses may the mesh you download a small windows service onto each windows machine you want in your mesh and then nominate folders on your system that are part of the when you copy a file into a live mesh folder which is the exact same operation as copying to any other foler on your system the service takes care of syncing that file to all your other participating an example i keep all my code source files in a mesh folder and have them synced between work and i have to do anything at all to keep them in sync the action of saving a file in notepad or any other app initiates the you have a web site with frequently changing files that need to go to multiple and presumably mutliple authors for those then you could put the mesh service on each web server and as authors changed or removed files the updates would be pushed as far as the authors go they would just be saving their files to a normal old folder on their

giving out trials of your software that are upgradeable to full versions other words assemblies that contain all not a whole lot you can do to prevent someone from hacking it in the even easier then with native obfuscation is the only way to prevent it from being reverse engineered in a very readable form but just using something like reflector will basically give you the of the simplest ways to keep up the appearance of licensing is key encryption to save licensing information enabled into a the public key in the assembly the encrypted information on the start of your application to check if someone is licensed to use your licenses when necessary with your private key and distribute those files keys if the data is small an alternative you can include the licensing information in clear text with a hash code is the licensing algorithm should also support in clear text with the and only check if the licensing information matches the hash

gof much like a real hides the underlying implementation complexity by creating another it hides a complex and generally separate system behind a simple to use for for a game might have the methods update and completely hiding the implementation of the but providing a way to interact with ddd aggregate on the other hand is a way of specifying a relation between objects that have a stronger correlation than normal they can be seen as nodes in a tree of domain objects and they are generally threated as a single unit in terms of data

going to take a contrarian registry is a fine place to put configuration data of all in general it is faster than most configuration files and more reliable operations on the registry are transacted so if your app crashes during a write the registry corrupted in general that the case with ini md is totally storing things like operation percentage complete in the registry any other non volitile is a horrible on the other hand storing data like the most recently used files is just fine the registry was built for just that kind of number of the other commenters on this post talking about the mru list have discussed the problem of what happens when the mru list gets out of sync due to application wondering why storing the mru list in a flat file in storage is any also not sure what the of storing your data in the registry the registry is just as secure as the filesystem the registry and the filesystem use the same acl mechanism to protect their you are going to store your user data in a you should absolutely put your data in at least that way if two different developers create an application with the same name many applications are there out you have

good info to change of file versions and assembly versions need not coincide with each i recommend that file versions change with each change assembly versions with each build just so that you can tell the difference between two versions of the same use the file version for deciding when to change assembly versions takes some discussion of the types of builds to shipping and builds i recommend keeping assembly versions the same between shipping this avoids assembly loading problems due to version some people prefer using publisher policy to redirect new assembly versions for each i recommend against that for it avoid all of the loading for if a partner your they may not know to install publisher your app will be broken for even though it works just fine on your if there are cases where different applications on the same machine need to bind to different versions of your i recommend giving those builds different assembly versions so that the correct one for each app can be used without having to use builds for whether a good idea to change that version for shipping it depends on how you want the binding to work for do you want these builds to be or are there many changes between the two are they going to break some do you care that it breaks them do you want to force users to use your important if you should consider incrementing the assembly then consider that doing that too many times can litter the disk with outdated you change your assembly versions change hardcoded versions to the new i recommend setting a variable to the version in a header file and replacing the hardcoding in sources with the run a during the build to put in the correct i recommend changing versions right after not right so that more time to catch bugs due to the

good to be in good have a similar situation on my in my a task and trying to find the other people in my role in other whenever i meet the experience is and i learn a lot of good tips but i want that to happen more company also has so good to hear that other people have the same problem connecting with this tool that is theoretically about connecting and sharing trying a collection of things to see what so the person to person ennabled with email and our internal im system are the best connections but that involves a person to person stuff i had in via still a since anything public involves a certain amount of care and and the things i want to connect with others on do not lend themselves to the necessary level of corporate diplomacy needed to for a topic area our company has a see how well they it seems best when there is a group that is the who provides some basic level content for everyone else to feed off someone has to be bulletin we actually have mostly they have notices for one time but one thing we have are and sessions about specific technical a similar session for a roundtable on an issue or technical area might be valuable although it will only catch people in the local i started doing a lightwieght version i have lunch monthly with a friend who is a and we are inviting sooner or i hope be the software task manager suport and a natural place for like minded people to come hang social been prevailing upon the sharepoint portal people no to suggest that the difficulty with sharepoint is the lack of human social networks like and facebook all have the concept that you have through people form traversible webs based on interests and shared this is what i think sharepoint is most the really ambiguous need of finding people who know something about my current tasks and who might be able to help at least i think that last one is the big as we thrive on not just getting the info we but also being able to judge it against what we know about the source of a wiki is great for factual but the reason to interface with other humans to have that particular quality of interaction that is much messier than bare to get that in an online context you need connection to lightwieght topic and a chance to make some things access controlled so that people can speak their minds without corporate

guys have a string that looks something like the following with this string i need to be able to do the test end result should be the exact order of the tokens is not that wondering if anyone has any smart ideas of how to go about i was thinking a regex replace on each of the tokens on right and if a replace occur because there was not match just append but maybe there is better the right side should override the the left being what was originally there and the right side being the new another way of looking at is that you only keep the tokens on the left if they exist on the right and you keep all the tokens on the for the the problem is the efficiency with which the solution you i was initially thinking down similar lines but discounted it due to the complexity of the merge n and z is the number tokens on the left and right let alone the splitting and why i was trying to look down the path of a maybe behind the regex is just as bad or but having a regex which removes any token from the left string that exists on the right for the total amount of token on the and then just add the 2 string together vat test test1 seems more thanks token

had this intermittent issue when using my site is dynamically sometimes when i modify a user control my web site complains that it is defined in multiple it almost seems like the old control did not get removed from the temporary files and the updated control is compiled to the same directory so defined in multiple that would make sense to me except for the fact that i have no control over what is in the temporary files read that having circular references will cause made sure that i have circular even with the simplest site seen this noticed that when using master pages this error seems to come up a lot more read that a hotfix tries to fix this issue but gotten this error after applying the i get the file causing the issue and make an edit to it then the error goes even if i just put a space in the file it will resolve the can also get the error to resolve sometimes by visiting other pages of the site that might not use the user control and hitting this does not always i set the site to debug the error never if i set it so that it comiles on a page by page basis then the error does not happen as much but still is what the error looks an error occurred during the compilation of required to service this please following specific error details and modify code error defined in multiple using using even though the error above says i got that error from another source since i reproduce the issue every but the type of error is the gisresearch for your there was one statement in the link you caution even if you have is that if you go in and change something in one of your aspx this page will have to be but this cause an appdomain reload so the whole application is not batch compiled this has the effect that the page will now get recompiled separately and get its own so change your aspx pages on a live server too is a setting in determining how many recompiles are allowed before the app domain by default it is set to so after 15 recompilations the app domain will just as it would if you touched the or touched the bin seems to say that when and the site has already been visited and if you change a page it will only compile that one that sounds like it could cause i had thought changing a page or user control would cause the entire app to is defined in multiple places

handles this there is an operation to get immediate and a operations to get all would you consider that as an summarize the navigation functions each correspond to an axis type in xpath if the navigation function selects the axis name is if the navigation function selects the axis name is used with node there are functions and correspond to descendants returning either an xelement or an exception case is not surprisingly the most used the children in this is the axis used if no axis is for the navigation functions are not and but rather and is a subtype of include things like html but also html cdata or xelements are a type of but refer specifically to html xelements therefore have a tag and support the navigation its not as easy to chain navigations in as it is the problem is that navigation functions return collection while the navigation functions are applied to consider the xpath expression which selects a table tag as an immediate child then any descendant table data i think this would look like or allows one to call the navigation functions on a the equivalent to the above looks something like

hard answering this since you already link to articles that explains the let me try garbage collection you have memory and since gc will run your you have but resource is in the sense that you know things will be cleaned it is since you know when it will if you open a file and lock it while you have it not knowing when the file will become available to open again later on is but the guarantee that at some point it will be closed is and idisposable serves that bad part by adding deterministic resource you choose when to dispose of your closing the the network the database your and you will typically dispose of the resource when you no longer need when you no longer need the you dispose of the object keeping it the object will stay in memory memory for a while but the file will be closed when you say ready to be opened again right you gain deterministic handling of and couple that with memory management and you got the best of two

have a large software system with millions of hundreds of and thousands of interface based upon an earlier question in i have been able to start discovering what these interface dependencies actually challenge now is to have all this information available in a useful the data is in a sql database so building a report is but i need a way to actually model the data that is easy for the user to find what they are looking tried the standard solutions like but there ends up being so many dependency lines that the diagrams look like dense spiderwebs and are right now i just have a excel spreadsheet but that is not very anyone have any ideas or examples on how to manage this much specialized thought about trying to hack doxygen like but that seems like a lot of and architectural modeling of interface	
have a large vb6 and as we need to we are moving sections to targeting the framework we have moved a bunch of classes to a and they are set up properly to be exposed to the instantiates it passes this to a method in a differen which passes it across an this is no issue at all for com objects written in see the appdomain and wants the objects to be serializable or since we need the portion to change data that gets back to serializable if we mark the classes at inherits then we get remoting proxy has no channel sink which means either the server has no registered server channels are or the application has no suitable client channel to talk to the are no channels we are just going across an appdomain in the same it seems that is not treating the object as which it should be i remove both marshalbyref and things work only if the com object is instantiated by if the functionality in the appdomain creates the object and assigns to to be passed back to vb6 gives me automation very ugly kludge is to serialize the object in the new send back the and let vb6 but that seems have any com dll not working from vb6 across

have a problem need to translate a website into multiple already use gettext to translate the static but we have to translate some text content in multiple ui a found 2 ways to translate the use json inside our text this solution is every text input will need to be bigger because we guess the real size of the the a translating table that keep reference to the original model and translate every it will still need big field because we cant define the field size by the best solution i came with is creating a translating the table will keep foreign key of other for each we copy the record that need to be inside the translation there is 4 this solution make it impossible to have multiple translation for the same model in the same but not we could use something like someone database we have a table that contain strings and only string so we can search for a a string that is the same as the one used in the model and then use the we found opinion is that all of these solutions are the 4 solution is probably the one that looks i found any good i would really like to make this question is the best way to translate text inside a

have a program in which i want to be able to store certain data allocated on disk for reduced memory usage and first thought was to write my own custom allocator which managed the content of files on the but i want to see what alternatives there are looked into custom memory allocators and topics on object serialization but there are subtle both good and when adapting those principles to managing the address space of a this is accessed only through io functions rather than are only size of a file is not so it should grow when needed rather than being large and my it is acceptable to existing pointers after the data is not of a fixed most database implementations seem not well what is the best approach for this should i implement a simple memory allocator which treats a file as the im using on embedded implemented my own memory manager which uses buddy memory allocation and block sizes of powers of satisfied that it is correct and does not coalesces free and can do a the problem as there is quite a bit of internal and external not an expert in this field and although i find it fascinating still a i wonder if there are any other implementations that have done the same or similar surely i cant be the only helpful but so far incompatible topics i havent used mmap it addresses the file but not the management of the file address i have a reluctance to use boost libraries at the interesting but doesnt address variable size memory lea memory has very good insights into issues with memory but not in a position to try and make my own based dynamic memory

have a very strange my application stack is j2ee based and uses spring with spring webflow the app server is weblogic with an apache server in front we use siteminder webagent as the authentication layer in problem below could be caused by any of the layers above site performance is very slow and the reason certain javascript and css files are not being we know that siteminder strips away the header so we enabled ignoreext parameter add extension to existing list of unprotected file types this no js or css files were the problem now is that i see only 2 files not being cached the server does not return a and the reason being the response headers are the server does return a 304 but there ae some junk text in the headers and therefore the client is not able to decide where to get the content it looks like this this could be known problems with the 2 files of spring or a configuration in apache with siteminder or something else anybody ever come across any idea where to start http headers on

have a wcf service hosted with the builtin and when doing some stress tests i get a strange the first time i send a bunch of 5 to 10 requests are answered and the rest are returning at about 2 second the second time i send the 10 20 are returned and rest with 2 sencond above repeats until i can get over 100 requests returned but if i wait a minute or so the memory usage of the service goes down and the requests go back to returning service i am testing has a small so that i can get many open connections at the same if this delay is removed the requests return so quickly that i have perhaps connections open at the same this delay is to simulate db connections and other outgoing the behavior it looks like the servicehost is allocating class but i can not figure out what it could have a timer in the client that calls the service to keep it but that seems like a bad i have a high sustained load to the service it will crunch all requests but if i have a period of low activity and then a surge of connections comes in the service will be guess my question is what is it the get allocated during high load of the wcf and how can i configure the service to preallocate more of the things that get did some more and looking at the taskmgr for the process i can see that when the servicehost is there are 10 threads but when i start sending the threadcount goes as long as the threadcount is high the servicehost can process incoming requests but if i pause sending the the open threadcount and subsequent requests starts taking longer time to how can i tell the servicehost to keep a bunch of threads or more than the that it keeps by of wcf with

have an order class which goes through a series of defined to aid with i have implemented the state pattern such that the order object has a currentstate member which implements an iorderstate i then have concrete implementations of this interface such as orderstatedelivered etc question what is the correct way to transition the order object between is it acceptable to have an method which allows an external service to set the the criteria which determine the state changes are stored externally to the order object so this seems the obvious answer but slightly uneasy about having a public method on my object to change something as fundamental as thought it might be useful to add some more detail about my implementation because i wonder if actually using the pattern correctly in the first the pulbic api for creating and authorising an orderfacade as new order add lines this will validate the order and transition it to status valid this will commit the but only if it is at status result function looks something like function originalorder as as if dim validator dim valid if end return end end you can the currentstate member is the current iorderstate implementation which determines which activities are valid for the i wonder whether this should be responsible for determining the transition rather than the should an object using the state pattern be transitioned to the next

have been asking a lot of questions about a project i have been working on here is the scenario i am in and any help or point in the right direction would help a is a network program built with a server and multiple each client has a gui which must act according to commands sent from the each client is wrapped within a class called this has a gui and a main and the server has a main method only at this class was created in the main thread like public void new was working until i realized that the entire class was now executing in the when i wait for commands from the server the entire gui locks up until that command is sent and proper actions are as you can this is a horrible design and proved to be a real pain of a coding environment when every time you want to check for something you must find some crazy work around so that the gui still remains i must check for the commands from the server in a separate thread and run the gui components in the my second implementation had two classes one for the gui and one for the the idea was that the had a variable that held the gui so that i could access the gui from the something like public gui and then start this gui inside of the public void new work because inside of the new object refers to the not the can i communicate between the class in one thread and the corresponding gui class in the edt between the edt and main	
have been developing an application that works with the google maps api to assist in logistics and planning for a small shipping company in our one of the features is for the company to input a list of customers and the system will package up all the customer addresses as a series of send it off to and get back the direction information for the problem that we have been having is that many of the addresses in our database are not great and will often times are not able to be processed by google when we do this we receive back an error but i would like to be able to determine which waypoint was the one to fail way the client can then go and fix the address in the here is a chunk of the code that handles the initialization and current error if map new gdir new if function var waypoints new var str waypoints function if corresponding geographic location could be found for one of the specified this may be due to the fact that the address is relatively or it may be else if geocoding or directions request could not be successfully yet the exact reason for the failure is not error else if http q parameter was either missing or had no for geocoder this means that an empty address was specified as for directions this means that no query was specified in the error else if given key is either invalid or does not match the domain for which it was error else if directions request could not be successfully error else unknown error problem is that the method in the gdirections object seem to return status based on each individual but from just the entire list one fails it all only real solution i can think of performing checks in other areas of the is to send each waypoint off to google maps in a separate request and check validity that way prior to sending off the entire waypoints list for the gdirections but that seems incredibly inefficient when dealing with a larger set of customer maps api finding waypoint that caused

have created a assembly that is exposed to com according to the exceptional article and deploy a com by phil everything works fine in the sense that the assembly is properly registered for and compiled com code can call it without any only odd thing is that developing against the assembly when using vb or vba requires that the programmer to the exact file location of the associated after which everything works just that the class library is not showing up directly within the references dialog so you must browse to the file the com interop aspects do work i would think that there must be some setting that would make the library directly visible within the references dialog for vb and anyone know what this setting would or should this be happening automatically for me just by having it thanks in advance for any answer question about whether using the using a setup and not explicitly using the assembly is being correctly which can be seen by the fact that within the key correctly holds the full path to the compiled com components execute against this dll just only when developing against it using vb or vba that they do not appear within the references dialog i therefore need to to the correct file after which it works further it appears although the class guids are being registered my file is not being i have no idea why registering the file should put some registry entries for the interface on which my class is based at but this is not strange that this lack of registration does not seem to affect the ability to other than its discoverability within and references properties for my file within the setup project do seem to be the property is set to and the property is set to i am puzzled as to why this would not be successfully installed on the target it turns out that the setup project is being built despite it reporting that the is actually a build warning a not an being reported that it as to create registration information for file name since this was a and not an the compile was stating and the error list was opening this it seems that this can be an issue when attempting to create a setup project when vista is your development as described typelib registration problem in vs2008 setup is a somewhat manual fix described unable to create registration information for file named have not tried the fix but i will tomorrow and report back if this solves did not work out so it seems that running as suggested in that article does not work when running on since regcap is actually run internally by the setup project itself on creating the this is not terribly in the setup project was almost certainly failing because the regcap command that it was calling was so calling regcap directly is of no bottom line is that this is simply a bug when attempting to create a setup package on perhaps it is a combination of visual studio 2008 and not attempting the same exact approach is to create a setup project on visual studio 2005 running on windows xp had absolutely no problems very well may be fixes to get this running right on vista visual studio but i could not track it much more efficient for me was to build using visual studio 2005 on windows xp to generate the com registration and then to import them into my visual studio 2008 setup these can be exported as files via regasm using a switch against the dll and using regcap on against the since my com interfaces will not be i only have to do this this issue in visual studio 2008 when running on vista will be corrected at some but if hopefully this post will be of some value to someone else who finds him or herself in the same to get com server for excel written in installed and registered in automation servers add a project to the vb6 references

have different opinions on how to organize their hard why should you enforce a particular should be able to check out multiple working copies of the same project in the repository impossible if you insist using the same one large project i worked literally thousands of files assumed that the working copy was in a fixed absolute path to work with several branches of the we had to resort to using different drive letters meaning that we had to divide our hard disks into many partitons or more were this was very we had to integrate the project as a of a larger this meant changing all those absolute a tedious and relative paths gives you much more if everybody has the project root at the exact same you notice if someone adds an absolute path somewhere by	
have done a good job of explaining your so let me help you decode the error match expected type against inferred type the putstrln is show missed off all the other the they just show more and more enclosing in haskell is an so therefore everything has a that includes something like if you type in ghci you will see it string io means that putstrln is a function that takes a string and returns an which in this case is the action of putting the message on the in your code you gave a so the compiler inferred that the expression had the type that is the part of the compiler error the compiler was also doing type inference in the other from the outside amongst other things it noticed that the this expression seemed to be applied to an empty which has type a list of we know furthermore the result of the whole expression should be of type therefore the expression should be a function to turn into a list of the type of which is written that is the part of the error this point the compiler concluded that it could not match up these two so it reported the match expected type against inferred type is probably the commonest error message you get when trying to compile so its worth trying to read it and understand look at the inferred type and try to figure out what part of the quoted expression has that then try to figure out why the compiler expected something else by looking at the surrounding

have done various audit schemes over the years and i am currently going to implement something like uint not uint not not date not not uint not uint not not date not not uint not uint not uint not date not not null current records are always in the person if there is a change an audit record is created and the old record is copied into the table the id does not change and there can be multiple audit id is in the tables so you can link multiple record changes to one audit record if you you have a separate history table for each base table and want to use the same table to hold old and records then you have to mark the records with a status the problem with that a real pain when querying for current records trust me done

have found that generators are very helpful in cleaning up your code and by giving you a very unique way to encapsulate and modularize in a situation where you need something to constantly spit out values based on its own internal processing and when that something needs to be called from anywhere in your code not just within a loop or a block for generators are feature to abstract example would be a fibonacci number generator that does not live within a loop and when it is called from anywhere will always return the next number in yield yield while yield you have two fibonacci number generator objects which you can call from anywhere in your code and they will always return ever larger fibonacci numbers in sequence as lovely thing about generators is that they encapsulate state without having to go through the hoops of creating one way of thinking about them is as which remember their internal got the fibonacci example from and with a little you can come up with a lot of other situations where generators make for a great alternative to and other traditional iteration

have spent a lot of time recently reading the http specification and relating it to i have found that there are two interpretations of the http delete method in regards to its and here are the two you delete a resource with http and it succeeds and then you try to delete that resource n number of you should get back a success message for each and every one of those delete this is its you delete a resource with http and it succeeds and then you try to delete that resource you should get back an error message because the resource was specification says delete is but it also says that sequences of idempotent events can still produce side i really feel like the second camp is and the first is what have we introduced by allowing clients to think they were the cause for deleting a resource previously are a lot of people in the first including several authors on the so i wanted to check if there was some compelling reason other than emotions that lead people into the first the correct way to view idempotency in terms of http

have to disagree with nick on the notion of values ending up in the url in there is no try query string parameters can supply the model values with either difference which is possibly significant is that when passing id and name as those are the only two fields which can ever be when passing a person as an potentially other fields could be this may or may not be what you but updatemodel will accept a whitelist of properties like it to update similarly for binding a person instance in an so long as you remember to consider including a there is no real difference me the biggest difference between the two options you show is who is instantiating the person when you pass id and name as it will always be your controller code which instantiates the when you pass a person as an it will always be the model binder which instantiates the this could be significant rather than instantiating a new person you would like to materialize an existing instance from a

have to implement an algorithm to decompose 3d volumes in the algorithm starts by identifying which vertexes is on each side of the cut plan and in a second step which edge traverse the cutting process could be optimized by using the benefit of sorted identifying the split point is o but i have to maintain one such sorted list per axis and this for vertexes and since this is to be implemented to be used by gpu i also have some constrains on memory management intrusive and c are a complete i expect to endup with and 12000 fortunately this can be optimized by using a smarter strategy to get rid of processed voxels and order residual volumes cutting to keep their number to a in this case i would expect to have less then 100 points and 300 this makes the process more complex to manage but could end up beeing more question is thus to help me identify the criteria to determine when the benefit of using a sorted data structure is worth the effort and complexity overhead compared to simple intrusive linked to switch from unordered lists to sorted lists

have tried to get this to work but been i am a a real nube with js so please keep that in mind when trying to help have to spell it out for me cuz i just understand what is happening yet with all this have two things that i am trying to get one is a set of radio these buttons are a group meaning that only one radio button can be the values that i have for these radio buttons are either 1 or 0 and are coming out of a is the problem i am i can switch the buttons and change the vals in the db but when json calls the data out of the there is no change in the buttons to the for if i changed button a to or the val in the db changes to when that page is viewed from that moment button a should reflect when the user checks the db val is then changed to 0 and the button should reflect that as i understand is how to switch the actual buttons to reflect the values in the here is my code so if is my second the checkboxes are exactly the same as the radio buttons with the exception that they are not a each checkbox has its own again i am using 0 and 1 but multiple checkboxes can be checked at one here is the code for that as if someone please guide when i put an alert in the js code i do get the alert so i know good there but because i know not able to troubleshoot this any found the original post that i am here is the to switch on and off checkboxes and radio buttons with

have two lists containing coordinates i could also have magnitudes attached to each now each star has random position jiggles and there can be a few extra or missing points in each my question is the best 2d point matching algorithm for such a i guess both for a simple linear and polynomials in the in the lingo of the point matching looking for the algorithms that would win in a shootout between 2d point matching programs with noise and spurious there may be a different depending if the labeling info is used the transformation is restricted to being am aware that there are many classes of 2d point matching algorithms and many algorithms in each class probably hundreds in but i know if is the consider the or the by people in the field of computer many of the articles to papers i want to read have online versions and i can only read the before i settle on a particular algorithm to implement it would be good to hear from a few experts to separate the wheat from the have a working matching program that uses triangles but it fails somewhat frequently of the such that the solution transformation has obvious distortions but for no obvious this program was not written by me and is from a paper written almost 20 years i want to write a new implementation that performs most i am assuming that there have been some advances in this area that make this person person person person is currently considered the algorithm for 2d

have worked on both green field project with fully unit tested code bases and large applications that have grown over many years and with many different developers on i would not bother an attempt to get a legacy code base to the state where units tests and test first development can add a lot of a legacy code base gets to a certain size and complexity getting it to the point where unit test coverage provides you with a lot of benefits becomes a task equivalent to a full main problem is that as soon as you start refactoring for testability you will begin introducing and only once you get high test coverage can you expect all those new bugs to be found and means that you either go very slowly and carefully and you do not get the benefits of a well unit tested code base until years from never since mergers etc in the mean time you are probably introducing some new bugs with no apparent value to the end user of the you go fast but have an unstable code base until all you have reached high test coverage of all your you end up with 2 one in one for the cause this all a matter of scale for some projects a rewrite might just take a few weeks and can certainly be worth

having trouble designing a good architecture for a particular portion of my especially where maintaining state is have a group of parsing class reads in a block of data into a buffer and handles the overall control class takes the block of data in the buffer and a and divides it up into smaller chunks for the to is an interface that i am trying to i think i want to do something like this represents some data structure containing various bits of state that will include a bytebuffer holding the entire block of raw represents information including the position of each chunk within the and any other information the has determined about the void void chunkmetadata void will call to let it set up any state at the beginning of a and is committed to leaving a designated portion of the blockinfo constant until it makes a matching call to afterwards it might reuse the data buffer for the next runs through the data block and splits it into chunks according to a predefined data and will call multiple once for each one reason for the contract to include a buffer that remains is so that can copy the whole block of data at the beginning or and have to reassemble the chunks into the one block when they were there together all the a division of is just responsible for managing the overall routine and reading in the it care less about anything is the thing that splits the data block into chunks and it care less about what to do with them or how the data got is the interface trying to design so that concrete classes can implement it and work without or caring what it or without it caring about how to divide up the block into chunks or where the data came question should the burden on maintaining any state be on the class implementing and kept out of and if the semantics of my interface include the fact that the raw data block in blockinfo will not change between calls of and should i then only pass it in to and not to the other or is it okay to send it along for there a better design pattern to handle a situation like interface how to handle stateful

hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than i used too much distributed version control but in on the bazaar they say that most complaints about performance true have you found this to be is performance pretty much on par heard that speed can affect workflow are more likely to do good thing x if x is specific cases does performance currently affect workflow in bazaar vs other systems and just trying to get at why performance is of particular usually when i check something in or update i expect it to take a little but it i when i have a so it interfere with my but then i used dvcs so maybe that has something to do with significant is the bazaar performance

hope that in this i can get opinions on best practices for the interface between jsf pages and backing thing that i never can settle on is the structure of my backing i have never found a good article on the properties belong on which backing when is it appropriate to add more properties to a given bean as opposed to creating a new bean and adding the properties onto for simple does it make sense to just have a single backing bean for the whole considering the complexity involved with injecting one bean into should the backing bean contain any actual business or should it strictly contain free to answer these questions and any others that may come for reducing coupling between the jsf page and the backing i never allow the jsf page to access any backing bean for i never allow something such always require something a backing bean value string return i loop over a i use a wrapper class to avoid drilling down into an object in a data for this approach feels to it avoids any coupling between the view and the please correct me if backing bean structure

i assume allows you to reuse session identifier only if we operate in cookieless but not if we use cookies to store session from my allows you to reuse a session for if you make a request and your query string contains an expired creates a new session and uses that session the problem is that a session id might inadvertently appear in a public place such as in a results page in a search this could lead to multiple users accessing the server with the same session identifier and then all joining the same session with the same shared not sure i understand how reusing session identifier could cause session id to appear in a results page in a search avoid this potential security recommended that you include the optional regenerateexpiredsessionid attribute and set it to true whenever you use cookieless this a new session id will be issued if a user connects with an expired session the only drawback is that this process also forces the current page to lose all view state and form because performs a redirect to make sure the browser has a new session needs to perform a redirect to make sure browser has a new session it just extract session id from the url and throw it when using if a client sends an invalid session id a stale cookie for the server will reject the generate a new id and send that value back in the cookie with the to be sure i understand what you are session is and if you make a but your cookie contains a session id of an already expired then server will generate a new if session is cookieless thus id is contained in url then by default will create new session using that same the redirect is performed to ensure that the client received the new session id value and properly sends it back with the just a that why it instead just put new session id in a url and send it there must be a reason why this work and thus redirect is session

i finally found a way to check if results were selected or not the huge help of of we set up an hidden field which will record if a result was selected by it is set to afterupdateelement is only used after a so we use this aferupdateelement to turn our hidden field to the user changes the search field for a brand new value not no afterupdateelement is and our hidden value is still set to solution to that problem is to listen to a key if a key is then the hidden field turns back to this works for all even the enter key actually used to make a so this is an exception we should remove from our keypress finally have a look to our extra function keycode else if keycode if can then use the hidden field to know if the text value should be edited or with this if the user types a value matching an existing without selecting it will be considered as a new and will lead to a duplicate entry if you add this value to your this was ok for as i was working with and two different people may have the same	
i first saw i thought it was basically a representation of then i the important thing that a particularly representation of but that it is one that everyone agrees just like and once hard to displace due to network the new alternative would have to be much better 10 times to displace of ascii has been replaced by for to xml has a x43 but is declining while json will json replace xml as a data which which are another representation of but which has not gained mainstream there are many other such as yaml and protocol buffers binary can see json dominating the space of communicating with ajax and this possibly could into other systems being based on is better than json as a interested in xml as a has an established ecosystem that json especially ways of defining formats and transforming them xml also has many other esp for web services but their weight and complexity can arguably count against and make people want a fresh start to beginning as a fresh start over like json is json replace xml as a data

i had a very bitter experience with mq series partially due to the fact that it was pushed on to us microsoft by the partnering the use of mq series any messaging was an integral part to the we were building a process that handled supply chain fullfilment for backorder if our partner a distributor have the items their customers they would send a message into a b2b that would target potential companies that could fulfil the had built two different flavors of the first was an ftp approach where fixed width files were sent back and forth at regular and we had added all sorts of rules to help ensure we miss any second was using mq series where the messages were placed into a queue using guarenteed then we would pop the queue and process the the queing system was great benefit here as it allowed us a reliable way to transmit critical messages that resulted in real money being moved the flip side with the same mq series we had to implement a synchronous query to get we wanted it to be synchronous because our users accessing this via the web would wait to get the doing this over mq series was a very interesting and painful the only reason mq was used here was because it was an existing line of communication and the query functionality already second example and this time was using msmq was a site that collected information from dialhome code injected into client the dialhome code would collect feature usage statistics like sqm when the messages came in to the web service we would drop them on a then we could have any number of application servers popping the messages and pushing them to the database to be rolled into the here ensured we could handle bursts of messages by quickly placing them on the this help the scalability and reliability of the

i have a simple pathfinding algorithm which precalculates the shortest route to several target each of which has a different this is somewhat equivalent to having one endpoint with a node between it and each though the edges there have different the algorithm it uses is a simple spreading which in 1d looks this this means means 3 2 4 3 2 2 handled distance 5 4 3 3 2 2 handled distance 4 4 3 2 3 2 2 handled distance 3 4 3 2 3 1 2 1 1 2 handled distance 2 any remaining rooms are suppose i have a precalculated pathfinding solution like this where only the 5 is a 5 4 3 2 1 i change the wall to a recomputing is just all distance nodes ignore the ones which already i am not able to figure out an efficient way to handle what to do if the 4 became a clearly the result is 5 in a 2d solution not sure how to efficiently deal with it is easily possible to store that 4 depends on 5 and thus needs but how do i determine its new dependency and values rather avoid recalculating the entire which is better than is to only recalculate array elements with a manhattan distance of 5 from the and to maintain source would basically mean reapplying the algorithm to a selected area but can i do how to handle changing weights

i have the library you wish for it may be out there somewhere and would be but this may one of the interesting concepts the school of unit testing thought has come up with is the idea of an in some there seems to be as much value in taking the calls an object makes to the entire universe of things outside of and turning them into an as there is in the typical act of making an interface for methods the outside world can call your this you might instead of mocking the entire file making one or more logically coherent interfaces for the answers and services your object needs from the outside the calls would merely answer the questions you need answered not dictate you can use dependency injection as you mentioned to inject in the implementation you desire for your and probably use moq to do so since familiar with your might have a method called it might accept a if there is a business question your object is trying to and seeing if a file exists is merely the that question is then your outgoing interface might not have a method about file existence at it might instead be something like or even is some but might be truer to the principles of good unit testing let your express what it is trying to and let your unit tests test it and only just a thought hope it

i just finished watching an episode of so try a differential diagnosis you know that it works with the thin driver from both but expiring in the jboss you say for sure very but it would appear that you have a jboss instance on compb and on and your code runs happily when it runs in the jboss instance on compb but core dumps from the i infer that when you run on talking to the oracle instance on have you tried running the code on compb but talking to have you tried running the code on but talking to the oracle on actual errors indicate a fault occurring in native code in a dynlib module and we know that you have different versions of the oracle stuff on compa and so my first suspicion would be that you have incompatible versions of on the two i observe that you have a different version of oracle on compa and i predict that the code on compb talking to oracle will and that the code on compc talking to compb will want to check the versions of the oracle oci driver software on compb and you can using oci and to both compa and compc connect using but can using to both compa and so it be a server you have this narrowed three connection methods and and three and the only one that fails is using oci from that fails talking to both compa and follows the problem is a configuration problem on compc still failing the since the same code works against compa and compb when running on it has to be a compc not a problem in your against the from compb and from confirm the rcp the compb onto compc and out what went wrong with

i really know glsl been doing gpgpu programming with the amd stream which has different programming you comment on i gather that you are interested in using the gpu to sort a huge database like creating a reverse phone book or but you have a small dataset and each fragment has own dataset to more like trying to do median pixel can only say in small the sort algorithm really while people have spent careers worrying about which is the best sort algorithm for very large for small n it really matter whether you use quick heap radix shell optimized bubble unoptimized bubble at least it matter much on a are simd so they like to have each kernel executing the same operations in lock calculations are cheap but branches are expensive and branches where each kernel branchs a different way is if each kernel has own small dataset to and the of data to sort is data dependent and it could be a different number for each probably better off picking a maximum size you padding the arrays with infinity or some large and having each kernel perform the exact same which would be an unoptimized branchless bubble something like i know sort of 9 points tmp min b a b a n n for i i twosort

i the bounds rectangle actually is always the same size as the frame and has the origin relative to the frame rectangle coordinate for some reason the bounds rectangle appears to be smaller than the frame the content will be clipped while the frame rectangle uses larger space than what would if the bounds rectangle is bigger than the frame it valid to think about frame rectangle and bounds rectangle in the way of an html div container absolute positioned and has an and in css see any reason why it would make sense to have a bigger bound another problem raises up from the positioning of the bound relative to the frame rectangle coordinate so even if both have the same if the bounds rectangle is not positioned in the origin at do we have a big problem what it make sense that the bounds rectangle of an uiview can be bigger than the frame

i think doing two you have a scaled version of as long as the relationship between this time and time remains constant fairly sure just delegate this scaling behavior to a single that would have signatures virtualtimespan be using this to map virtual time spans to instances of thereafter you can operate in which probably simplifies things a little since you can the use standard scheduling second part regards scheduling work for a future worker a number of core technologies working with conceptually i think is the of a lot of it defines concepts much like the ones using and what you i think taking a look at jms is fine for seeing concepts you may find it uses selectors to send tasks to specific much like the ones you jms never seemed to fit the bill for most a lot of people found it was too heavyweight or the implementations too so usually people ended up with home made queue but the concepts are all you just use quartz	
i think for a or at least one product in the it is best or at least easiest to have a centralized setup you trying to make a single coherent after dvcs instills a different working spirit and mode which you may or may not want to encourage in your in it increases experimentation use a local and not bothering it is easier for maintenance of old or if you do a lot of changes that need to be kept track of without putting them in the actual is invaluable when you have a team that works offsite a in my company engineers often make last minute changes on where for security reasons they have internet central vcs simply do not work for this there is a central but the fact that you work in a decentralized manner is dvcs is a superset of centralized vcs in terms of of you can still choose to use a centralized vcs if you think need the additional

ide gives you the to do either it would be unusual to do with explicit the members are not on the public this is handy if the interface directly tied to the intent of the for the members all that helpful to regular callers only to some very specific so there is no purpose having them on the public api causing is also useful is a conflict between an method and your own and they mean different is a signature conflict between other typical example of the last point is which has a method at two levels in the interface hierarchy it is common to implement the typed version using implicit and the untyped version using explicit

illustrate the really the example reality the code is much more you have a flex which underneath contains a something document is a model containing some you provide a selection setter on the as the clients want to know anything about the underlying datamodel function set for in var t title so provided is the selection will work what to do if you already at the of the what the selection ought to be been passed on the in the flex you might have something initialising give the control the fetch set the selection because fetchtitlesevent operates at the time is unable to somehow we need to that code to set the selection on the several ways i can think to do but all have code smell do it in the after the fetch has been this pollutes the command with knowledge of the view that need to know feels like a maintenance nightmare waiting to and means the views are totally bound to and those commands have a callback from the event when complete that does it make some composite command that starts in fetchtitlesevent and ends in a new command to do the seems fragile to me how does the maintainer know callbacks are neccesarily and still binding ui control knowledge into have some kind of waiting for the event queue to have been quiescent for a number of hackity do it in the bind to the collectionevents in mycontrol on monitor for once the row arrives that matches the select and stop monitoring for control feels the right place to do collection events sometimes throw exciting change or refresh events seems an expensive monitor to have lying pretty much leaning to are there any other options that have used before to trap this issue particularly are there any codified into libraries that i might as it must be a fairly way to set the selection of a flex control that initialized	
imageurl for this control stored in a separate it works great for profile rather than an why not a generic handler they are a little more lightweight than an just search generic and find a number of basically the code you have now behind your but without all the page want the photos to be stored in a thumbnail grid when the user clicks on the it should bring up the photo on a separate i would think any repeatable control that supports templating of the item element as listview in should do the trick for you just set the image or height and width as appropriate for your wrap which ever tag you use in an html anchor with an href to your page that displays the image at

implemented a lot of the code in zend other have the reason that returns strings instead of native php integers or floats is that database extensions return and the reason for that is that there might be no native php type to represent certain database is a signed by the php type is limited to so if you fetch data from the database and implicitly convert it to some values might be there are several other similar for and the string representation for all data types is the best way to remain simple and be safe about avoiding data and avoid writing lots of code to do data type that extra code would incur a performance if you have specific cases where you need database results to be mapped to native php data you should implement it yourself in your application code in a custom

important thing to remember here is that the web is each request from a browser is completely separate from all previous happening with your code is that the class is being instantiated from scratch each time the client requests a that includes clicking you want values to persist between you have to store it in a location where it can be retrieved the session object provides this for need to store the iputname variable in the session probably the nicest way is to encapsulate it in a int get if return set the viewstate object will work as well long as viewstate is turned on on the this encodes the value in a hidden field in the html and decodes it when it comes apologies for repeated but i should clear this what jonathan and emil have said is you should probably be using viewstate for this rather than session unless you want this value to remain accessible between note that this does require that is turned and it will result in a larger payload being sent to the

irritated and ok venting a bit here at the but my actual question i promise just spent the last 2 weeks touring many aspect of wcf and now web this was done the get error after hours of that in the configuration somewhat surprised that anyone even bothers using enough need to have a client app call code on a web server over the i want the server side code to look something like string sometype foo the client side to look something like this i new important bit is that the configuration for this is minimal and no including the service name in 12 different no wizards generating code and no hidden urls that i need to change when i switch from testing on my local machine to testing on out i just want it there anything like actually prefer a less fewer things to break model than a more more flexible as long as i can stuff any serializable type down the pipe all the flexibility i asking how to use wcf or asmx services either can be made to work like i but i really care used at this point as long as it there something like web services that works the way i wish they

is a and so contains oodles of good and bad advice on me just tell you what i have found from much experience doing performance are tradeoff curves between performance and other things like memory and and you would expect that to get better performance you would have to give something is only true if the program is the tradeoff most as first is away from the tradeoff most of the it is irrelevant and ignorant to talk about giving up one thing to get method i use is not it is i care how fast various routines are or how often they are i want to know precisely which instructions are causing and dominant and primary cause of poor performance in software efforts little is too many layers of abstraction are each of which extracts a performance this is not usually a problem until it is a problem and then a what i do is tackle one issue at a i call these short for each slug that i remove yields a speedup of anywhere from to depending on how bad it every slug that is removed makes the remaining ones take a larger fraction of the remaining so they become easier to in this all the can be quickly disposed that i know what is costing the but the fixes may be more such as partial redesign of the possibly by removing extraneous data structure or using code if it is possible to do that can set off a new round of until the program is many times not only faster than it was to begin but smaller and clearer as recommend getting experience like this for because then when you design software you will know what to and you will make better designs to begin at the same you will find yourself at odds with less experienced colleagues who begin thinking about a design without conjuring up a dozen to try to answer your optimization should be done when diagnosis says you have a some code at the bottom of the call stack appears on enough call stack samples or to be known to be costing significant and if the is in code you can if got a in or look higher up the stack for things to get rid that	
is a app to learn how to program it uses these global functions that but they do very specific tasks as i this is a horrible example of what good code should there are other functions that just return the part looking rather than me just writing what you you can read full listing take care that you note down which must be within the mythical loop and which you can use it happens there are even more ways to get the but i was really imagining for this example you would do something i is the post id inside the loop though i could be as another poster says you can use a fairly simple function to grab the current loop brings me back to perhaps wanting to explain why learning programming from wordpress is a bad they have so many damned way of doing the same damned thing that almost impossible to keep on top of blog is a really simple set of data moreso in case because it fully but rather than just having one way to output a title echo you have umpteen all doing subtly different you really want to learn how to program of hacking your way around the crap that is the wp creating a simple blog engine is fairly quick and certainly how a lot of people get into a new language or if you want to have have a look at of the wordpress if fighting something like this in the future that have 100 ways of doing i really recommend it uses up a whole buttload of resources for something relatively easiest way can be as simple as just taking the source for the original sticking it in a new function and replacing the with note there may be some database connectivity to handle that returning prematurely may so if the echo the last instead of returning right store the string as a variable and return at the end of the

is a bit of a pain in a linked list since you have to manage allocation separately to the list one approach used in the past is to have a structure struct struct struct int char or use different type for i realize that variable sized but allocate a structure struct char char malloc 1 sizeof you have a node for all intents and looks like struct struct struct int char char in graphical form means overlap assuming you know how to address the payload this can be done as cast for easy changes to station cast line simply casts the address of the character the to be an address of the actual payload this you can carry any payload type you want in a even payload types in each without the wasted space of a this wastage can be seen with the int char 96 bytes are wasted every time you store an integer type in the list a payload type in the allows you to easily detect what type of payload this node is so your code can decide how to process you can use something along the lines enum

is a case of premature unoptimization you should never do something because you think it will be you has extra if you have no need of the extra features of arraylist then it is wasteful to use an for some of the things you can do with a list there is the arrays which means that the arraylist provided more functionality than arrays is less now using those might be slower than using an but it would have to be profiled to be should never try to make something faster without being sure that it is slow to begin which would imply that you should go ahead and use arraylist until you find out that they are a problem and slow the program however there should be common sense involved too arraylist has the overhead will be small but it will not be easy to spot in a as all it is is a little overhead and a little overhead so common sense would unless you need the features of arraylist you should not make use of unless you want to die by a thousands cuts internal if you find that you do need to change from arrays to arraylist the chance is pretty straight forward in most cases becomes that will be of the you are using the look value then there is no code to change for that as going with what you equal access depending on your for instance the android vm inline methods is just a straight interpreter as far as i so the access on that will be much there are other operations on an arraylist that can cause depends on what you are regardless of the vm could be faster with a stright again you would have to profile or examine the source to be wrappers increase the amount of memory being should not worry about before you profile on the other hand you choose what you know to be a slower option unless you have a good reason

is a conceptual basis for database classical database there are three and conceptual model emerges from requirements and evolves as the underlying subject matter evolves or as understanding of the subject matter the conceptual model pins down elementary data as to form and but deal with such issues as table logical model uses the relational model of it can be derived from the conceptual but it also deals with the composition of normalization and other composition issues come into play the logical model anticipates the table and also the queries and updates the application will physical model implements relations as and also adds all the other features like needed to actually build the derived from the logical but data and disk space all come into sounds lengthy and but actually if you know how to do the whole thing can be done in a matter of while the rest of the team is still debating functional for a really small project 50 it can be done in with just pencil and for larger there are tools that make design more less error and easily what happens when you discover that the conceptual model was inaccurate or and the other two models and the database itself need to be where comes to the data independence does for database design what encapsulation does for object it prevents a minor adjustment in one place from propagating all over the application objects are only dependent on the data that they a new table has to be added to a the chances that any application will be broken is vanishingly even if an existing table has to be queries that only use the old columns see any even when objects are dependent on the you can still give the altered table a new and then create a view with the old name that makes it look like the old table is still physical data independence is almost complete in a good you can reorganize add and drop and you have to change any of the change management can be done brilliantly using the really good dbms products out a lot of the dbas and programmers know how to make adequate use of these dbms even though they have been around for

is a good question does it assure there is conflict between stack allocation heap is a single contiguous address space in almost all so the stack and heap allocated memory do have to coexist in that each time the stack grows and shrinks this is not done with individual heap you can still think of the stack as a single large block of memory allocated from the if the stack grows beyond the boundary of that then we have a stack overflow someone should name a website after a each time a thread a new stack has to be allocated for and when a thread dies the stack can be and it would make sense for those blocks to be allocated using the same heap management as is exposed through very approximately speaking you can think of the stack as being a type of object that coexists in the a whole stack is all in one when a thread starts and then it gets suballocated and then it gets in one you can you like to live the same virtual memory apis to find out about the stack and to force virtual page within it to be

is actually two questions rolled into there a particular type of java functionality that people are using jruby for or is it mainly because of the performance advantage that jruby gives versus the reason i ask like to add some java functionality to a rails project to show that ideally this java functionality would also be useful rather than which leads to my next question an example of something that would make a good demonstration of java functionality being added to a simple rails crud guess anything you can do in a ruby you could just as easily do in a java class about twice as much so i understand the question may be hard to just wondering if there is a particular type of functionality that is more appropriate to do in nothing at stake by the just playing around and testing things an example of java functionality that i could add to a

is almost certainly simpler and safer to use a well tested external library you can find google than to code a filter since you said anything about you the format of you there is little more that we can tell know anything about how your ide but importing usual takes one of three forms depending on how the library is made available to you to obtain source for one or more functions with good read the copy the code into the appropriate add the files to the attempt to fix missing preprocessor obtain a plain binary library and headers for you from you os package management read the tell the ide where to find the headers and the attempt to fix obtain a framework that provides the this is a bit more but it also starts with read the then probably proceeds a lot like the library but with more code to be any case you will at some point be some of your source files to make the external functionality visible to your you want to find a candidate library to see what form it is provided then read more about your ide to see where you go from so question that might be relevant to your been a long time since i used but if that is your base programming you should be aware that there are of facility that matlab provided to you that are not in plain vanilla you almost certainly want to use some framework or another to give you some of that support	
is almost tautologically a you gain runtime efficiency at the cost of other things compile as really never a good idea to do unless you know what the tradeoff is and why thinking about do i do x can be very to much energy in that direction can easily lead to you misisng out on method y which is much better often faster this is how can make your code particularly if you do too much of this on a big project from the it represents a lot of if you afford to overcome that you can easily become locked into a bad design because you afford the time to restructure this way lie your boss may be thinking of is more of an issue of writing bad code via inappropriate representations and not really the same thing as but an approach where you pay no attention whatsoever to appropriate data structures can result in a codebase that is slow and like the above requires heroic effort to general premature optimization really honestly is a terrible particularly when you end up with a finely well documented the only way you can understand piece of code you end up not using and not even getting into the issue of subtle bugs that are often introduced when of course a knuth quote encapsulates this what i get for typing too

is from the ant documentation and explains it pretty another build tool when there already because all those tools limitations that original live with when software across multiple tools are they evaluate a set then execute not unlike what you would issue on this means that you can extend these tools by using or any program for the os that you working this also that you limit yourself to the at least the os such as that you are working are inherently evil as anybody who has worked on them for time has run into the dreaded my command not because i have a space in front of said the original author ant way too many tools like took care of this to a great but still have yet another format use and is instead of a where it is extended with ant is extended using instead of writing the configuration files calling out a target where various tasks get task is run by an object implements a particular this removes some of expressive power that is inherent being able to construct a command such as rm but it gives you the ability to be anywhere and and you really need to execute a ant has an task allows different commands to executed based on the os it executing

is legal as in the os stop you from doing is it you should have some type of be bits on the they will come out either as ones or but nothing to say that all your bits will be written out before another process tries to read and there are no guarantees on how fast be written vs how fast be should always assume there is absolutely no relationship between the actions of 2 processes threads for that level bus locking does not happen unless you get it it can be harder then expected to make your compiler library os cpu get it synchronization primitives are written to makes sure it happens will make it and not that hard to so just do the question has changed somewhat since my answer was the behavior you describe is defiantly platform library and giving the compiler specific you are actually not guaranteed to have 32 bits written out in one imagine a situation where the 32 bit word is not aligned on a word this unaligned access is acceptable on and in the case of the the access is turned into a series of aligned accesses by the interrupt can occurs between those if a context switch happens in the some of the bits are some lets think about 16 bit cpus or 64 bit both of which are still popular and necessarily work the way you actually you can have a situation where other picks up a word sized value written you write you code as if this type of thing is expected to happen if you are not using there are ways to preform your writes to make sure that you get a whole word written those methods fall under the category of and creating synchronization primitives is the type of thing best left to the and hardware especially if you are interested in portability you should even if you never port your

is more but not the analogy with physical locks is pretty by putting two physical locks of the same type on a you ensure that a thief that can pick one lock in five minutes now need to spend ten but you might be much better off by buying a lock that was twice as which the thief could not pick at cryptography it works much the same in the general you cannot ensure that encrypting twice makes it more than twice as hard to break the so if nsa normally can decrypt your message in five with double they need ten you would probably be much better off by instead doubling the length of the which might make them need 100 years to break the a few it makes sense to repeat the encryption but you need to work the math with the specific algorithm to prove for is basically des repeated three times with three different keys that you instead of just encrypting three but this also shows how unintuitive this because while the number of it only has the effective of the des	
is more depth of what though it will be interesting to see if others agree or what they have to how computers work you have hardware that has integer and and a vast array of random access and instructions which are mostly of the form on reading the value of this go poke this new value into this memory cells has all kinds of perf implications when it comes to cache lines and coherency and memory models and integers are 32 or 64 and nearly all programming languages surface these data types that exactly match the nearly every runtime works with a small call stack where objects are and a more expensive where other objects can be created and destroyed when are consider most modern functional programming immutability is the you will rarely memory with new means you create more which means you allocate lambdas and continuations are the you more rarely have object lifetimes that correspond to the some fp runtimes use a in a cps implementation the notion of stack and program counter are recursion is a looping so you at least need calls to not consume the stack practically everything needs to and of course you need a algebraic data types provide tagged in theory these tags would only require an extra 2 or 3 bits of but to match the they often need to have an extra word of memory or i am kind of but the things you do in an fp language tend to correspond to exactly to the things that or are on the typical computer hardware architecture and basic language have to be that one can imagine a world where the runtime eschews a and makes fast not a bottleneck for one can imagine a world where the interoperable integer types have 29 or 60 and the use the extra leftover bits of the word for the or algebraic type or think some fp do some of these the point if you take a modern functional language as a and then design around it would look very different from the typical of think i communicated that and i am imprecise about many details i know but hopefully you grok the gist of my thesis	
is more likely an issue of not initializing variables to some initial so in debug they have some sort of but in most things are initialized zero some may be taking that you do not without your source code for really hard to spot has bit me more than is assuming you are not expecting to see anything using stuff like as make sure your packets are under 1024 bytes in or you will not get took me a while to figure this one out back when xp came and i figure out why my code worked on but not even though send would return it never actually sent the dealt with udp a lot on so if you give me some example code i should be able to help check that all your variables are initialized to some sort of default value on both the sender and the is just good and then it and try check your packet size with a before it and if greater than 1024 also a good idea to check size of the received and if not exactly the size you then drop the this holds more true for but still me know if any of this i posted a lot of udp code on here a little while and that code you might want to refer to

is not directly comparable to prolog is a declarative logics programming language that is basically a theorem prover using horn one of the nice characteristics of is that it will allow you to modify a program severely during compile or for in most modern prolog implementations you can directly write grammars using the dcg clause grammar rules using the operator are rewritten to prolog clauses using term be rewritten use of position variables enforce adjacency of the daughters on the right hand side of the since prolog will try to prove the head of a clause by proving its daughters you basically have a parser without any additional another example of program modification is the assertion or retraction of facts or which can be used to modify the behavior of a program at on the other hand is an impure functional the connection between prolog and ml is that some theorem provers are written in say ml is far more but for its niches prolog is a very both are very useful to even just for just widening your

is safe to inject an ejb in a servlet as a servlet instance as long as the ejb is you must never inject a stateful bean in a must implement your ejb stateless in that it hold any instance variable which itself holds a stateful value persistence if you need to use the persistence then you must get an instance of it in the methods of the you can do that by having a persistencecontextfactory as a ejb instance variable and then you get an instance of the entity manager from the factory in the method of the persistencecontextfactory is thus it can be injected in an instance long as you comply to the above mentioned it should be to inject a stateless bean in a

is supposed to be i think microsoft recommend it for up to 4 or 5 but in practice recommend that you never use an access database where there is more than a single although if you really have the choice acceptable for two or given certain had experience of four or five systems using an access database all acquired from other and in all cases moved them to sql server as the as a priority after any immediate updates and fixes required when taking the contract generally as soon as i could talk the boss paying the bill into time span for that is usually several so i have seen it running concurrent for a reasonable length of time under several different it will generally work passably well if the system does not have a lot of concurrent and is not heavily the chief practical problems in my experience liable to corruption it just generally this too much of a problem as opening the file and running compact and repair will sort out the but a good backup regime is absolutely every time upgraded a system to sql server received a lot of kudos for speeding up the system from the database file bloats because of the way that access marks records as updated or this further slows the system as the file has to be loaded across the consequently some regime that compresses the usually on a daily is of the above are much less of a problem with single user systems as the underlying issues that prompt these are much less in all i must emphasise that i would never recommend access for any however if really have too probably get away with it so long as a lightly used application and you do institute the backup and maintenance

is vaguely related i design the application or model from the database first through to ui or way my question is more about modeling and artifacts and less about the right way to do trying to figure out what sort of design artifact would best enunciate the link between features screens and database elements and most uml is very database models are very database and of screen designs are ui the my team is working on the first release of the we used use then did screen designs and database design was somewhat isolated from the a critical area for bugs was the lack of traceability between the use cases and their accompanying screens and the in our a very high degree of overlap between use cases and database many use cases touch over of the database so we have high contention over database design and easy for a small database change to disrupt the lower levels of business our next i want the developers and our dba to have a really clear insight into what parts of the database each feature the use design approach worked so keeping the trick is linking each use case and screens to the database model so the relationships are really obvious and hard to forget smaller projects only 10 but often worked on teams of 3 or created my own custom diagrams to show this part of the sort of a fusion of uml and database done in visio with no link to actual code or not sure it will work for a larger as its highly manual to keep up to and it auto generate code the way our database modeling tool is there a commonly accepted mechanism for pretty that going to change any time and we do love saying to is not a viable solution for our designs screen to database	
is valid to have an object that contains an in a standard you run into undefined two common copies its argument into each created the first copy will below why but each further copy will be because the element copied is also something during reallocation you can happen to have some elements copied a new but the copy being thrown away and other elements because must not have any effects if an exception is being thus some of your elements are now this is all about undefined behavior it does not really but even we try to come up with this behavior based on what we think is we would fail all the member functions like and so on have a const reference that takes an object of type a reference of type is tried to copied into elements of the but the implicitly created copy assignment operator looks like that it requires a object to be copied good implementations of the standard library check and fail to compile if the next you have to live with the next one will support element types that are merely that a moved object does not need to be equal to the object moved that will allow putting and into what the standard says for this certain cases handler operations on types used to instantiate standard library template the standard library depends on components supplied by a if these components do not meet their the standard places no requirements on the the effects are undefined in the following types used as template arguments when instantiating a template if the operations on the type do not implement the semantics of the applicable requirements subclause	
is very but the following is one possible a file is a first the data stored anywhere at still on the virtual memory manager allocates a range of virtual memory addresses to the process for the but those addresses immediately added to the page the program first tries to read or write to one of those a the os catches the page figures out that that address corresponds to a and reads the appropriate disk sector into an internal kernel it maps the kernel buffer into the address and restarts the user instruction that caused the page if the faulting instruction was a all done for if it was a the data is written to and the page is marked as subsequent reads or writes to data within the same page do not require since the data is in the file is flushed or any pages which have been marked dirty are written back to files is advantageous for programs which read or write disk sectors in a very haphazard you only read disk sectors which are actually instead of reading the entire	
is very common to develop using 3rd party libraries and component but like any other engineering it is a tradeoff of various risks and to use a 3rd party library that is closed source carries the greatest risk since if there is ever a you are at the mercy of the provider to fix choose a company that has a reliable track the library is open then you will always have the option to fix any problems many might argue this point but you may find technical a little harder to come by would in fact recommend always looking for an open source library before attempting to write any code for something that is likely to already have been most open source libraries have been worked on by much more than one person and have been refined to avoid many pitfalls that you may not be aware take advantage of and free yourself to focus on the issues that are unique to your

it is generally possible to call a dll function from multiple since every thread has own stack and calling a dll function is more or less the same as calling any other function of your own it is possible depends on the dll functions using a mutable or example if you do something like it is most certainly safe to be used from different in this example you guarantee that between and no other thread makes a different call to if the dll functions do not depend on some kind of predefined all necessary parameters are available at once and all other configuration is the same for all you can assume be it might be possible that a dll function looks but internally uses which if for example if the dll creates a temporary file with always the same name or it accesses a database which can only handle one request at a it counts as a shared i think of better the dll vendors that their dlls are use them from multiple threads without if they are not or even if the vendors know you should play it safe and use least until you run into performance in that case you could try creating multiple which wrap your dll calls and use them as

just started learning common rapidly falling in love with just moved onto the type i seem to be developing a particular fondness for applicative i understand in cl strings and lists are both but there seem to be any standard functions for mapping over a only i can see why they would be supplied for what with them being the fundamental datatype and but why was it not designed to work with as they are a more general it would seem more useful to target applicative functions at them rather than or am i completely misunderstandimatifying how it i was feeling particularly confused about was the way that sequences the abstraction and lists an implementation seem to be muddled up in the consensus seems to be that this is for historical lisp has been around so long that you can pretty much map out the development of software engineering practices through its functions and which functions apply to sequences and which to lists seems arbitrary at first glance because cl has a mixture of functions that operate only on and functions that do the same thing in a more general way on as someone who is just learning cl at the i think it would be useful if authors introduced sequences first as the cleaner and then bought in lists as the most fundamental implementation of that lists would still be needed as syntax of but by the time it is necessary to state this explicitly many readers would have worked this out by which would be quite an ego boost when starting programming and common lisp

just started working for the first time with a product delivered via the linux rpm rather than as a standalone and realized that this makes the test release cycle a bit more i was working with we would just change the build numbering in our build system to mark a build as a test or release candidate instead of a development and tell people to install only the candidate build for the problem with doing that with rpms is that if we change the numbering break the delivery mechanism and installed machines be able to tell which is the latest version of the rpm any best way thought of to get around this is to put the candidate rpms in a completely separate rpm but this also gets complicated because we have multiple rpms coming from the same repository that are on different release so be trying to pull the release candidate version of rpm a from the new repository while still wanting to get development snapshots of rpm b from the development must be a pretty common issue for linux so can anyone tell me the best practice thanks in advance a release cycle with a product delivered via

justification is a common and supported well in you want to use an environment within each line of latex with will correspond to one and you can choose which character you would like to have aligned on each line by placing an ampersand in your b c do something like what after on how you want to justify the first this will number each equation for reference in the if this is not required or use an environment adding a star after the environment name is a common idiom in latex which means number and can be used for sections and so forth as another interpretation of the justification i think you text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text c 12m of length of great 6m measure of 8m measure of it is in can place multiple ampersands to specify multiple but all lines must have number of alignment is a math lets you put normal a math there commands to within a math	
justifications to do with new platforms are usually to do with five support through and how well proven something with existing key systems and open platforms tend to mop the floor with the first three but that does depend on a staff cheap but if already got little concern from open source is a little more sketchy but still the key difference is that ms owns the entire aspnet from through to support is centralised that mean good your linux server software blows you might be able to get support from your main but they might push you out to the no judgement on the quality of the but a slightly more intricate is the silliest of the django is well how you use it that tested or of course there are using svn releases of django will probably result in the occasional the biggest issue and blocker for migrating is existing aspnet sites run on linux but you can deploy django on if you have key infrastructure to move you might have to stage even deploy django on iis for a until you can chuck windows out the standards are something relative new to management basically not finding yourself locked in five years down the of course the linux platform is great on that front but it is important to note that with any orm mapper the biz that manages your there is a certain lack of you can still access the data from other places but need to concentrate on might work almost no support short and really a subjective how much of a pain migrating is really depends on your existing if you have no existing setup to migrate things are if you have the technical wager most people would swing towards a more open a personal i moved to ubuntu before i dropped i tried to keep it going through vmware but eventually decided i needed something was before the aspnet mvc framework was and eventually landed with think go back out of even to an improved aspnet django is just cleaner my humblest of freelance so i can mostly suggest what frameworks to this has been great for learning django but if you find yourself working for one you might find this if looking for going to find a damned lot fewer jobs for django than you will i doubt ever reverse but there django work out

kind of client are we talking windows client or there are two very general patterns for you can either push or pull the pushing work if your on the internet run into firewalls and so you end up with a third variation where the client initates the and the server leaves the connection open to send information back and need to provide a lot more are we talking about internet or what framework are you how many clients are you a solution that can handle a dozen clients in a push model or the third could look very different from a solution which can scale to thousands of easiest solution is to do polling from the client which unless you want the server to have instant communication to the client is the way to and a heart beat is not instant you indicated are you really sure you want to do lower level network type why not build upon existing network strategies such as you can do a simple remoting service over http which will let you bypass or even better if your server is a web server then just setup a plain old xml have any examples i can share of but there should be plenty

kloc should be small enough to insert generics with a big obviously make sure your code compiles an runs on java se 5 the relatively easy thing about generics is that adding them makes very little change to semantics overloadings can change because of implicit cases as a bad example off the top of my cases adding generics will highlight conceptual problems with the using one as two maps with disjoint key for is an example in the java library where a single class has two distinct mode or like and are very local and can be added enums are rarer and might take some thinking about how you are actually going to use

know my solution is not very popular from the pythonic point of but i prefer to use the java approach of one with the module named as the do understand the reason behind the python but i am not too fond of having a very large file containing a lot of i find it difficult to despite reason is version having a large file means that your commits tend to concentrate on that this can potentially lead to a higher quantity of conflicts to be you also loose the additional log information that your commit modifies specific files involving specific instead you see a modification to the module with only the commit comment to understand what modification has been if you prefer the python go for the suggestions of the other if you instead prefer the create a containing class	
know mysql very but i think have to give the standard performance answer thoughts only with not database a new database means a separate file in the file these files could then be put on different filesystems if performance of one needs to be separate from the new database will probably handle caching all tables in one db is going to mean a shared cache for the whereas splitting the tables into separate databases means each database can have a separate cache all databases will share the same physical memory for but there may be a limit per to the separate this means that if one of your datasets becomes more important than the it can easily be pulled off to a new the databases has an added benefit of allowing you to deploy updates more easily than with the single to having multiple databases means the server will probably be using more memory it has multiple sure there are more for the but i am drawing a blank i suppose i would recommend the obviously this is only with the understanding that there may very well be a better way of handling whatever you are actually	
know not what you want to but the entry config file is the logical place to put these if every library required its own config file then it would get tedious to have to edit every single file instead of just would have a text file with the default settings included as part of your library as part of the which can be distributed with the library for the default settings configuration can be copied and pasted into the config

know this is not the answer you are most probably looking for but i would suggest that such a framework will be very hard not to find for doing something like dumping the stack cannot be done in a portable way as it can in a language like which not only shares a common runtime accross all but provides powerful introspection capabilities program in but my guess is that it can provide a in the same way as the stack is probably just another object in the runtime which can be inspected and on the other hand has none of these its meant to be a language that basically adds to c sure others will come up with much more elanorate explanations of over c but thats another is not rich enough at the level required to provide the kind of features you require in a generic there may be some code that could get some of this info at defined points for you out but it certainly wont be standards regards to graphs that sounds much more like which you should either be able to find something or more you can perhaps output your log messages in a format which can be interpreted by some of these existing things you could look at would be integrating with for which there may be richer analysis tools for would provide you with a capability along the lines of the one advertised for smartinspect that is based a lot of what i said here about comes from previous experiences trying to find decent frameworks in to do introspective type things as proper mock objects

learning the linux on a x86 architecture using the gnu as one of the aha moments was the possibility of using these system calls come in very handy and are sometimes even necessary as your program in system calls are rather expensive in terms of performance as they require an interrupt of course a system which means that a context switch must be made from your current active program in to the system running in point i want to make is currently implementing a compiler a university and one of the extra features i wanted to add is the support for code in order to enhance the performance of the compiled because some of the code will be automatically generated by the compiler this will almost guarantee that there will be really tiny bits of code in it as in order to gain a performance i must be sure that using threads will make this fear however is in order to use i make system calls and the necessary the tiny little threads will therefore be highly affected by the time it takes to make these system which could even lead to a performance question is therefore twofold an extra bonus question underneath it possible to write which can run multiple on multiple cores the need of i get a performance gain if i have really tiny threads as in the total execution time of the performance or it worth the effort at guess is that multithreaded assembler code is possible without system even if this is the do you have a suggestion even some real for implementing threads as efficient as in x86 assembler the gnu

left the original answer but i believe most of the value is now in the made it community so if anyone involved in the subsequent conversation wants to edit the answer to reflect that feel one how would it know how much stack to fixed for structures and objects but with an array it would depend on how big the array which known until execution if each caller knew at there could be different callers with different array you could force a particular array size in the parameter but that seems a bit as brian says the matter of would you want to achieve through all of is it a matter of wanting to make sure that the contents of the original array	
legal but not legal c89 or presumably compiling this as so if you use compiler options to enforce then gcce will reject it can do in c or obviously you lose the benefit of the field names being right you have to rely on getting the order good option in is to define a constructor for your and initialize with const foos this does prevent the struct being so you make the same assumptions about its representation in

like doctest but when you have complex arguments that you need before you pass to a function it become really hard to you start using multiple lines assigning then calling that you would like to this approach that you have multiple tests rather then the real number that you an example will illustrate what i returns what you y return the above there is only one test and the other is just this is what gets y expecting 2 tests in 2 2 passed and 0 looked at the flags surely i missing you distinguish between a test a variable

like passing by reference if null does not have but i can see the arguments for if careful about coding you could probably eliminate the accidental objection by making sure you always pass your variables by const const a this approach may require additional handling in the but cleaner at call a a lot of extra code for little as kenny pointed addressed this from the opposite end specific passing by but not an option for for you wrote your functions to take a reference wrapper as their like const int a the pointer problem is more no way to ensure the pointer is so you end up with either run time problems for pointer or run time or tis the nature of just my for what

like the resource probably exist with that you aware that finds a resource relative to that whereas you can use a leading forward slash in to mimic so roughly equivalent to this a file a specific file on the normal file that trying to if using would be a better use if a resource bundled in a jar file or in the classpath in some other use if an arbitrary file which could be anywhere in the file another thing to be careful which has caused me problems before now if this has worked on your dev box which happens to be and is now failing on a production server which happens to be check the case of the the fact that different file systems handle differently can be a

like to share my point of view on this interesting problem as a i think i have the most efficient i remember you negate a signed integer by just flipping the first for if n 1001 1101 1110 1011 1110 0000 1110 then 0001 1101 1110 1011 1110 0000 1110 how do we define a function f that takes a signed integer and returns another signed integer with the property that taking f twice is the same as flipping the first me rephrase the question without mentioning arithmetic concepts like do we define a function f that takes a sequence of zeros and ones of length 32 and returns a sequence of zeros and ones of the same with the property that taking f twice is the same as flipping the first if you can answer the above question for 32 bit then you can also answer for 64 bit 100 bit you just apply f to the first 32 if you can answer the question for 2 bit yes it turns out that changing the first 2 bits is the take which is a signed swap the first bit and the second flip the first return the the step 2 and the step 3 together can be summerised as looks that should remind you of the 90 degree rotation of the plane and the multiplication by the squar root of i just presented the alone without the long it would seem like a rabbit out of the i wanted to explain how i got the	
like to something is wrong with the argument argument is null i use this one much but a common use is indexing into a and giving an indexer which is to could also throw as yoooder points out bellow his answer up as that invalidoperationexception makes sense if your given a valid argument but the method being called is not valid for the argument based on the current could also throw the notsupportedexception if the arguments passed in are just not imagine an ftp and you pass a command in that the client this would be a valid usage as trick is to throw the exception that best expresses why the method cannot be called in the current for the link i updated all to point to response to your i would throw an look at what msdn says about this is when a method is invoked and at one of the arguments passed to method is not nullnothingnullptra reference in visual and does not contain a valid in this case you are passing a value but that is not a valid since your range is way you go document it make it clear what your api because although i might say argumentoutofrangeexception another developer might say make it easy and document the yoooder again points out in the comments documentation is good but to a ideally the exception should be detailed about what went why it is and how to fix i love when error messages point to help documentation or other example microsoft did a good first step with when you encounter the error they tell you in the error messgae the kb what they do well is tell why you it specifically

little more insight in to what trying to accomplish might be ali already mentioned one way that your code could you could have your code add values to hidden form fields along with adding the rows on this would allow you to add rows at the browser level without requiring a post of the downside to this is that you will still need a page refresh before your server side code can process any of the second option is to implement some kind of ajax behavior on the this will allow your server side code to access the new row values as they are being added without requiring a total page since using you use ajax but you could try never tried it but better than hand rolling your

lot of people here are saying stuff about going to make a new the the server side is fast becoming especially when you consider your criteria interactivity of you want to learn 4 core and if you think you know them or can figure them out without probably the standards have evolved for too and way too easy to get a clouded picture of things should be if you just try to learn by standard know in and not in think you know do you know the difference between a block level element and an inline do you know which elements are allowed in which other css or i recommend the definitive know css selectors inside and need them for technology be stunned at what can be accomplished in which you thought you could only do with tons of tags in not no longer a joke language that it running the most most and interesting sites around so glorious i find myself not able to even speak of maybe the commenters will be less overcome with glorious aura and will be able to breathe its all of the really impressive is on the client side the language mean as i love linq i doubted it at but i am drinking that by the gallon these but if you choose php or ror or java or but that should be a secondary learn the 4 technologies above first need them no matter what doing on the

main difference when it comes to oop and programming is that you would like your new thread to have as its function a method of an there are a few programming models for implement a interface is the most common used your class implements a standard interface that has a method which is usually a virtual method called you put your code in that virtual method and when you need to spawn a thread you create a thread object called and you pass to it an object of your class that implements the then you call the method of that object and that will take care that the code you have written in your class will be run a a new in this example both and are provided by the chosen threading library or by the standard of the programming language of your also please note that the names of these two classes can is a big difference between and java when it comes to has not support for as opposed to java which has support for for you will need to use a specialized threading library such as pthreads or more general purpose libraries such as poco which already have support for the least recommended way is to call directly the related services of the no matter what edition you are using you will already have the support for programming

method also allows derived classes to handle the event without attaching a this is the preferred technique for handling the event in a derived if i understand the above then if we derive a class from we should instead of subscribing to selectedindexchanged treat method as an event handler and thus put any event processing logic inside override void handling would that be better than subscribing to an via onselectedindexchanged in ascx file we use onselectedindexchanged attribute to attach event handler to an name of this attribute is the same as the name of why is why instead the name of this attribute selectedindexchanged attribute refers to an event and not to a method that calls this be sure that you call or the event you want anyone else to be able to respond to this then would it be perfectly ok not to call since i would think not calling it really do any harm besides not firing an event and thus event handlers be called realize some events need to be fired in order for framework to do its but what about not calling should derived classes handle an event without attaching a

my based on my gut instincts and various anecdotal i think that is the key aspect you rewrite something from you will do it based on the experienced you gained doing it the first you rewrite something from you will fail for innumerable am not sure where the knee of the curve is for the transition from small to big success to guesses are that when multiple developers are on when multiple interacting components are or when the people who are doing the rework are not the same as the people doing the original or when the original product is old enough that it does not have the same of tests as newer then all these things contribute and also all these things are correlated to thus the only way to something is to do it one small component at a

names in php start with so is the name of a is a special variable in object oriented programming in which is reference to current is used to access an object member properties or in like the syntax in your code means the value of variable into the entryid field of this operator in means pass here is a output is note the output is the above because we used a reference to where is pointing is stored in so is actually a pointer to arguments are passed by value by default by so when calling a when you pass in your they are copied by value not by this is the default in most however there is a way to have pass by reference when defining a what ever you will affect the actual parameter outside the output is are many functions that behave like like the function that sorts an array will affect directly on the array and will not return another sorted is something interesting to note because mode could result in more memory and php is an interpreted language programs written in php are not as fast as compiled to make the code run faster and minimize memory there are some tweaks in the php one is not sure about the which means you are coping a variable into php will copy a reference to the first variable into the second so your new is actually a reference to the first one until the value is not copied but if you try to change any of these php will make a copy of the and then changes the this way you will have the opportunity to save memory and if you do not change the points to equals to now php will copy 3 into and places 4 into all if you want to place the value of into property of your the above code will do and will not copy the value of until you change any of results in less memory if you actually want them both to point to the same then use

natural inclination is to look at a bracket in the order the games are you read the traditional diagram from the outside but think of it the other way each game is played between two one the other a bit more to it than just the winners of a particular pair of games face off against each other in another so also a relationship between the games irrespective of playing in those that the teams that face off in each game in the first are the winners of two earlier you might notice that each game has two that precede it and determine who faces off in that this sounds exactly like a binary each root node has at most two child if you know who wins each you can easily determine the teams in the to design a database to model you really only need two and each has two foreign keys that relate to other the names but we would model them as separate keys to enforce the requirement that each game have no more than two preceding call them and to keep with the binary tree we should have a key called that tracks the reverse as i noted you can easily determine the teams that face off in each game by looking at who won the two preceding so you really only need to track the winner of each give the entity a foreign key to the the small matter of seeding the that modeling the for the first round you could model this by having a for each team in the overall competition where that team is the and has no preceding the overall schema would other attributes as you see other attributes as you see you would add all the other information want to the outcome case the game was won by forfeit or some other out of the ordinary

necesarily mean bad many people find it easy and useful to use side effects to solve a the key is first knowing how to do it in a pure so know when impurity is appropriate have the concept of purity in the type so a method that takes in arbitrary delegates can always be depending on how for aka would usually be considered a pure since it modify its arguments or modify global nothing stopping you from putting such code inside the argument to for return definately an impure usage of enumerables can do whatever they want as they your code using a foreach loop is just as still modifying the source i write code like that all the chain together some then execute a foreach on it to invoke some cleaner and it has no addrange method for some if i want to add a bunch of things to what do i x in prefer the second at a i see how it can be construed as being worse than the first is it bad when it does side effecting code in a place not this is the case for my first example using and even there are times when the scope is very limited and the usage is written code that does things like to avoid i would give it another the main confusion is this immediately evaluated or foreach implies that go execute a loop right but something returning an ienumerable implies that the items will be processed as so suggest giving it another name something like and making it static x in yield return

need to generate a wcf proxy for a service exposed by our the service is locked down pretty so this is proving new to so i may be missing something client has only opened up their firewall to our production server so i generate the proxy from visual studio on my dev the service is only exposed over and it requires us to authenticate using a client was hoping to run svcutil on the production box to generate the and then copy the files but svcutil refuses to run because the client is using a it gives me the following underlying connection was could not establish trust for the secure remote certificate is according to the validation tried adding the certificate as a trusted root but that in the certificates mmc i get does not have enough information to verify the there some way to bypass the security check that svcutil is can browse to the wsdl successfully from when remoted in to the production i just have to click to this website i also have to select the installed client which works i can then download the wsdl and xsd files manually through so another alternative might be to generate the wcf proxy from local copies of the wsdl and instead of running svcutil against the live but i know how to do that tried putting the static wsdl and xsd files up on another website that we and changing the attributes to point to the new but when i ran svcutil against this i got a bunch of errors about duplicate type declarations there was a validation error a schema generated during 1 1415 validation the already been i missing some obvious way to do or should we just demand that the client loosen up their for any help you can give wcf proxy against untrusted ssl

need to have read access to the entire code this probably involves getting symbols from the linker that reference the first and last addresses of the you can cast those addresses into a suitably sized data and run any common crc or checksum algorithm you want over the code verify the you need to know its authoritative this can be done after linking by computing the crc and patching it into the initializer for a suitable embedded systems where used a similar technique as an integrity check before replacing the firmware in a field i usually arrange the memory map of the image to begin with a data it is easy to write a utility to compute the crc of the image and fix up the the embedded boot loader then can verify that crc during boot to determine if valid firmware is and fall back to an update utility if of the update utility uses that same crc to validate a new image before some references on in case its painless guide to crc error detection recommended by on

never heard of this technique it just looks interesting so done a few searches and what i think found hopefully someone who knows what talking about will contribute think supposed to be a better way of generating branch coverage not a complete substitute for path a far longer document here which restates the goals a onjava article says goal of basis path testing is to test all decision outcomes independently of one testing the four basis paths achieves this making the other paths think here to the goal of basis path not as one might complete waste of think the point of testing branches is to break those accidental correlations between the paths which and the paths you that occur with terrifying frequency when i write both the code and an arbitrary set of branch coverage tests no magic in the linear just a systematic way of generating branch which discourages the tester from making the same assumptions as the programmer about correlation between branch basis path testing misses your and in general misses where n is the cyclomatic it just aims not to miss the paths likely to be as letting the coder choose n paths to test typically does

not sure if they are completely interchangeable in this specific since you are basing the size of an array member on the i believe that it has to be an enumerated i have the time to look it up in the but i would be surprised if you can use an member as an array size even if it is since the actual value might not be visible in the in myclass static const int int in const int in think that the compiler can compile without having already compiled most other i would say with the class static option since it will participate a little more intelligently in type deduction and i only use enumerated integer constants when i really need to or when they are truly enumerated constants just took a look at the standard whilst i was munching away on lunch for the nudge can involve only literals variables or static data members of integral or enumeration types with constant expressions template parameters of integral enumeration and looks like the constant and enum will both work provided that you provide the constant initializer in the declaration is that

not that of be aware that ssis the xml such that there is one output from the xml source for each path through the a trivial example is produce three outputs and three error it gets will produce and both normal and error project i worked on started out having about 203 i was able to flatten the xml schema and produce only 19 or still a lot considering that each output needs to have own processing the xml task cannot handle 1gb or more of it load the entire document into try doing an of such a file and watch what happens what happens to had to create an element of my that processed the child elements of the root element one at a this enabled me to flatten the xml as well as handle large documents 10gb test document more fun depending on what you want to do with the resulting in my we had to send each of the outputs to staging this is not a bad but you have to realize that the data in the outputs are a single child element will reach the ends of the output paths a little at a and never know when all the descendants have finished being this makes it impossible to handle the processing on a transactional basis one element at a ssis adds a surrogate key think what to each child there would be a parentid added to the a childid to the and a childparentid also added to the to refer to the parent of the these can be used to the element back together but only after all data have finished being written to the staging the only time you can be sure that any given element has been processed in full when they

not the only but say relatively personally not a fan of hungarian at least not in the simple sense that just restates the type information which is already present in the of hungarian notation will explain the difference never bothered me that but i can see their if you use a common prefix units of length vs units of you accidentally assign a length variable with a weight even though both may be for private members you can pretty much do what you want agree with your team what the naming convention should the important point is that if you want your to fit in with the rest of use hungarian notation in your public members

noticed this in a server when making a lot of tiny objects that quickly get thrown the garbage collector keep the problem is more pronounced when the tiny objects have pointers to larger objects an object that points to a large the gc seem to realize that if it frees up the tiny it can then free the larger even when calling this was still a huge problem in and we ended up doing and what i recommend to you is to maintain a pool of when your object is no longer throw it into the when you need a new grab one from the pool or allocate a new one if the pool is this will also save a small amount of time over pure allocation because java have to clear the worried about the pool getting too large thus wasting you can either remove an arbitrary number of objects from the pool on a regular or use weak references using one of the advantages of using a pool is that you can track the allocation frequency and and you can adjust things using pools of and and we maintain separate of sizes in the pool we always allocate arrays of size that are powers of our product does a lot of string and using pools showed significant performance in the gc does a fine we just noticed that with small objects that point to larger the gc seem to clean up the objects fast enough especially when the vm is under cpu is just a hint to help schedule the finalizer thread to do more calling it too frequently causes a significant performance	
notion that prepared statements are primarily about performance is something of a although quite a common poster mentioned that he noted a speed improvement of about in oracle and sql noted a similar figure with it turns out that parsing the query just such a significant part of the work on a very busy database also not clear that query parsing will affect overall probably just be using up cpu time that would otherwise be idle while data was coming back from the as a reason for using prepared the against sql injection attacks far the performance and if not worried about sql injection you probably should

object contains entries for all its plus extra space to hold a pointer to the the vmt holds more than just i explain about the at my web including a delphi 2009 introduces another hidden field in addition to the vmt pointer to hold the synchronization you can determine whether it is added at the beginning or at the end of the class with some simple ttest obj objaddr fieldaddr it prints the value then the monitor field must be at the end of the object because 4 only accounts for the size of the vmt if it prints the value then the monitor field must be at the adjacent to the vmt expect find the monitor at the it means that the layout of the descendant object simply the layout of the base object with all the new fields it would mean the offset of the monitor field depends on the type of the and that makes the implementation more a class implements an the object layout includes more hidden the fields contain pointers to the when you have an reference to an the pointer it holds the same as the pointer to the vmt which is what you have with an ordinary object the pointer value will be the address of the hidden written about the layout of classes that implement

of a dvcs does not prevent a centralized code you still can set one repository as the all developers pulling from the benefice here is a natural backup through data while maintaining a central code the true benefice comes from when you need developments the other from the other in order for your work to go you can easily pull one one their working branch into your repository tracking without having to wait for them to publish it officially in the central means even with repository only replicated a you still get the main advantage of a namely the ease of pulling and merging branches from local and diverse while having a main base where to publish your code for the rest of the development tests would only runs from codes published into that central can also see with a dvcs managed that way a natural process what is at least unit tested for instance gets to be published into the central with a cleaner history the intermediate commits can stay in the topic branches of the local

of i would say that the problem you described pertains not only to rmi but to any kind of interface of a including plain java although in case of rmi a bad design may have additional knowing the i can only guess by looking at my such an unnecessary complexity of an interface is often related to invalid or insufficient business requirements defined for the if the in future the guys at the other division will probably have to frequently modify the trying to catch up with new which is usually a cause of pain for the users of the although changes of the interface are of course natural over in this case they may result in a deep an overly complex interface usually means that the author exposes implementation needless to this can lead to unnecessary interface changes due to the evolution of the switching to a different or even optimization but not giving the users more than they need is a straight way to letting them use functionalities not even intended to be or even in it may turn out that the users invoke the interface in an unexpected it makes the maintenance of the component a wrap it the key arguments for a simple interface clear business definition of a improved flexibility of the and all those profits are good for both the component developers and the

of the answers are correct in saying that this is a specificity problem but are incorrect or incomplete in explaining the specificity in your case is than and so that rule wins even though it comes css rules are located these rules 1 if the declaration is from is a attribute rather than a rule with a 0 otherwise values of an attribute are style sheet these rules have no so and the number of id attributes in the selector the number of other attributes and in the selector the number of element names and in the selector the four numbers a number system with a large gives the in your case you have two a b c d 0 specificity a b c d 1 specificity 0001 is lower than 0010 and thus the first rule are two ways to fix to make a rule more avoid doing this because it is confusing when you have lots of rules spread out over several a selector for the td you want to you can add a class name to it or an id and this will allow you to supersede the rule from the linked css 0010 0101 0011 fixed the specificity rules for comment prompted me to the which does show that the selector contributes nothing to the specificity shiny and shiny and

often cited that ror and similar frameworks based on dynamic languages are more productive but i am really interested to know if there are hard data to back this this be as one should be made certain that she is not comparing apples with things like type of project enterprise and team size should be taken into for small projects it is more than evident that such frameworks are indeed far more productive than java so this is a short list of arguments used to support this and what you can do for them in the java is a more intuitive and concise you can do the same thing with much less think you can have the same thing in unless of course you use a dynamic language that runs in the jvm your ide can in jave an ide is an essential tool and it will pay you back if you learn to use it well in fact there are many things you can do with a java ide that are simply impossible to do with a ruby or python plus you have the benefits of a static typed it may take more time to but it helps you avoid common is much more fun to makes the developer happier and more as highly subjective argument in my opinion over configuration makes things dependency injection framework like spring or guice can mvc already there for java mvc frameworks can made load database items as can change the database on the ibatis or another orm framework can with you can achieve similar functionality with what you have in ror with yml new modules or ant ivy can deployment for ide or jetty can in fact debugging is easier with integrated with the use of mock objects facilitate dependency injection framework can help with mock junit was a pioneer of unit i think that java is less easy to

once did some research toward improving and the problem with simulating 3d audio is that so many of the cues that your mind uses the slightly different attenuation at various the frequency difference between sounds in front of you and those behind you are quite specific to your head and are not quite the same for anyone you a pair of headphones to really make it sound like a creature is in the leaves ahead and in front of the character in a then you actually have to take that player into a measure how their own particular ears and head change the amplitude and phase of the sound at different distances and phase are and are both quite important to the way your brain processes sound and then teach the game to attenuate and the sounds for that particular do exist that have been mocked up with plastic and used to get generic curves for the various directions around the but an average or standard will never sound quite right to most the current technology is basically to sell the player five cheap have them place them around their and then the sounds while not particularly well reproduced actually do sound like coming from behind or beside the player they coming from the speaker behind the some games do bother to be careful to compute how sound would be muffled and attenuated through walls and doors can get difficult to because the ear receives the same sound at a few milliseconds different delay through various materials and reflective surfaces in the all of which would have to be included if things were to sound they tend to keep their libraries under so public reference implementations like openal tend to be pretty here is a link to an online data set that i found at the that could be used as a starting point for creating a more realistic openal sound from craig craig

only issue with code coverage and unit tests is that unit tests only test what they were originally designed to and by are code and prone to the same functional that plagues regular are only good for what they are written and after a not high quality unit tests will obviously provide some these are my important factors for software of external data interface points of unit tests on underlying implementations such as of external implementation interface point such as of volume of code a system lives in it is exposed to a greater variety of data inputs as the dataset it has collected this by definition exposes the codebase to a greater number of edge cases and can be mitigated by the quality of the data error and unit also the moving targets of the underlying environment that the system operates one way to moderate this is to put the application in a the system implements i could see the codebase facing a greater chance of failure as more plugins are code elegant if probably going with the simple point here that the more code there the less likely it is that it is well but i suppose it could be turned my codequality would probably involve the metric of what the code coverage in the unit tests you could run a static analysis program against it to determine potential bugs and that would probably be some help as i at some really hard to score because code should be weighted a lot heavier than a and refactoring ought to be figured but only where there are evidences of software the a my contribution to

only way to make the initial compilation of the query faster that i know of is to make the query less the msdn documentation on considerations for the entity and indicate that there is any way to save a compiled query for use in a different application execution would add that we have found that having lots of includes can make query execution slower than having fewer includes and doing more loads on related entities some trial and error is required to find the right i have to ask if you really need every property of every entity you are including it seems to me that there is a large number of different entity types in this so materializing them could well be quite if you are just trying to get tabular results which you intend to projecting the fewer number of fields that you actually need into a anonymous type should be significantly faster for various this frees you from having to worry about eager calling can certainly speed up the initial view generation by precompiling the entity there is on msdn for but since you pay that cost at the time the first query is your test with a simple query shows that this is running in the neighborhood of 2 seconds for nice to say that 2 but it save anything

opinion is and would be the best of the three for development that is web doubt anyone writes new web apps in c or it was done 10 years and likely a lot of legacy code still in but not particularly well there appear to be as much tool and they probably have a small active community that does web development perhaps for web server i wrote many website com objects back in the but is far more productive that no compelling reason to code c or this unless you need do still write if but typically for a small problem communicating from via to old doing some things that are downright clumsy in were a breeze to create a com object as a nice thing with is that you can also easily transfer into writing windows and console apps and stay in with mono also not limited to windows you may be limited to which libraries you this is all from a if you asked about embedded devices say c or you could argue none of these are suited for web but is pretty it works there are heaps of online a huge and free dev from a picking only one of and c as as a general better to stick with

optimiser will make its decision based on the relative cost of the full table scan and using the this mainly comes down to how many blocks will have to be read to satisfy the the rule of thumb mentioned in another answer is in some cases a full table scan will make sense even to get of the rows if those rows happen to be spread around many consider this create table t1 as select from alter table t1 modify update t1 set 2 where 3 rows analyze table t1 compute select from t1 where is not 861 you can only approximately of the rows in t1 have a but due to the way i built the these 861 rows will be spread more or less evenly around the the from t1 where is not likely to visit almost every block in t1 to get even if the optimiser used the it makes sense then to dispense with the index and go for a full table key statistic to help identify this situation is the index clustering select from where value 460 is quite high to the 861 rows in the and suggests that a full table scan will be see dbazine article on clustering

organization has been experimenting with the introduction of more been trying the scrum approach for a short and most of the team more or adapted to i like it as a but concerned about one potentially severe impact of the as teams are consistently focused on features and backlog and testers are more integrated with the overall development it seems like skill sets are becoming and people are sensing less respect for their individual of our developers are excellent at technologies and optimization of data others have invested a large amount of their careers learning gui technologies and have developed a fundamental understanding of users and usability in an neither skill set is better than the but they are certainly this an inevitable result of the scrum since everyone on the team i understand contributes to satisfying the next backlog or testing goal at the underlying philosophy seems to be can do this in my simply not most engineers have a particular skill set they have honed over the and the scrum in my tends to devalue those very abilities they were previously respected an example for a sudden change of technology occurs on the data and every item on the list for the sprint is based on this new the gui developers likely had time to become acclimated with the new might not be able to contribute to the at the very they will need to invest time to get ramped and then their code will be suspect because of their lack of understand the need for rapid development to discourage but this discount one fundamental people develop in accordance to their or their people seem to be less motivated when they perceive their position is one of we can anyone in to do this particular how does scrum address if it has anyone addressed this when adopting the scrum the scrum process ultimately divest team members from their respective

others has you prevent the user from starting a new session without resorting to activex or other the basic problem is that there is no way for you to know whether a user closed the old browser window or left it you can do is to invalidate the previous session as soon as the user logs into a new bit similar to how may instant messaging clients each assign a new guid to the user in your also store this guid in the session cache need to ship it back and forth to the which work for get requests on each page compare the guid assigned to the user in the database with the guid in the session if they return a have logged in from somewhere i was a bit too fast on the this prevent the scenario where the user opens multiple within the same browser so you would have to combine this solution with dave anderson suggestion for storing a viewstate hash simply a so that only the last served page in a session is allowed to post you can only rely on this framework as a convenience to the user since not any half decent hacker will be able to circumvent these

party tools and libraries go in version control along with everything we have a libs tree that goes under our vcs trunk right next to our app so it gets included with any branches or tags that we the one wrinkle i yet solved is windows tools and libraries that require their own installers instead of running out of whatever directory vcs gives os and recommend creating a vm for each release if you install multiple compiler versions in then your project wiki can document which vm and which compiler version to use for a given this automatic like your log file would but it provides a environment of potentially having to reinstall a machine to match your log some projects check their entire compiler into version but this seems overkill to me play well with ides and compilers that need their own track patch levels for the os and i realize that possible that a patch would break or change but the chance seems so low that the ratio just	
pass an array of bytes an integer and an if you are sending the entire byte nothing more and nothing as your you can just use the length property of arrays as udpclient new ipaddress ipendpoint new sendbytes anybody exception e the confusion here is that you think you have to count the number of bits that will be sent out over the what is actually required is just the size of the payload part of the provided byte array you actually want to send in this the library will do the and info

passing a for primitives is a either you need to modify the and in that case you pass a or you just need to access the value and in that case you pass a should only be used for complex when copying objects could be a performance in the case of unless you need to modify the value of the variable you pass a the reason is that take more computation time than since with the program needs to look up in a table to find the of the when this time is shorter than the copying references are an and have the same byte length in so the time of copying an as a return value for a function is equivalent to the time of copying an but in the case where an is no look up is therefore performance is

performance in internet explorer no news however there are some tips and tricks to speed it for there is this still i find myself unable to squeeze decent performance out of perhaps some of you have an idea what else to do so it was i want to do is create a table from scratch in 300 10 cells it takes at about seconds on my computer to do a 5 year old but still too my dummy function var var table var insertrow for i i var row for j j var cell i apparently is the only way to of was hoping to do it the explorer javascript performance	
performance issue here as been address so i repeat but i think a good tip if you are storing things that will be streamed out a lot as on a is to build in a caching this i mean store all the data in your but when someone requests that check if it exists on disk on a known in a temp if grab it from the db and write it to the and then stream that to the for the next request to the same since it exists on it can be served from there without hitting the but if you need to delete these files your goes it matter as they will be rebuilt again from the db as people request this should be much quicker than serving each request for the same file from the

personally recommend to people facing similar problems to use something like keepass or roboform to store these programs encrypt your passwords on a thumbdrive using a master password that the individual so that they need only remember the master in the event that someone looses their they will have a window of time in which they can report the compromised and allow you to change it will take a little bit of depending on the master before the person who stole the thumb drive would be able to brute force the master password to get at all the other stored avoid having any account shared by more than 3 at consider creating each individual an account with equivalent if a malicious employee has access to an account which they know is it might be more tempting for them to do malicious things since they know you could not hold them since it could have been any of several people sharing the also means you have to change the password every time someone you just their so although you have more accounts to you have less overhead when someone leaves since you have to notify everyone of a changed oh roboform also has a online password sync service over so you could just have people retrieve passwords via kinda cool once you get used to

php does not support method overloading the way you have experienced in other say but you can have method overloading in but the definition method is you want to have different functionality for a given with different set of parameters in you can do something like myclass public function is a function that returns an the number of parameters passed to the if 1 else protected function code protected function code could be cleaner but this is just a supports inheritance and so you can have polymorphism using you can have an interface like mybackupinterface saves the data on a reliable public function public function mybackupabstract implements mybackupinterface protected public function there is no abstract modifier in so avoid this class to be used in other public function throw new class is you can not instantiate backuptodisk extends mybackupabstract protected implement other methods public function is a function to save a string into a backuptowebservice extends mybackupabstract protected implement other methods public function suppose is implemented in the in your you might use it like some code to populate new new as are php is not strong typed we never mentioned that any of your would be a or but that would not stop us from having the nature of polymorphism which is different functionality over using the same

possible to create however is not about about statically based not runtime it depends if you want with methods or just with the data classes can be implemented with boost constructs like and if you want classes with you can use to bind methods to the or you can implement them on your own with a point interface like the way is to use generics so it can all be determined at for best be seen very few although i have seen that truly need runtime in most cases objects are born and die the same or at least enough to spend of their lifetime as a single class once they come out of their in many situations one finds themselves paying too much for runtime of course there is the school of thought that this provides better developer but in many each line of code will be run on hardware a few hundred million times more than the time it took to write so you can think about and runtime classes as paying up front or leasing personally i like to pay up

pretty much in your shoes still using for most of my work but using python more and more for other probably knows python and all his advice is from my point of view what made the biggest difference to me was the back into not necesarily spaghetti but learning that not everything has to be in an nor should it like the immediate window except because of how python works you need all the baggage and crap makes you put in before you can run things you can just whack in a few lines and see how things normally got an idle instance up where i just throw around snippets as working out how the various bits in the language works while editing my busy working out how to do a map call on a list but not on the lambda i should whack in a few lines into see how it works and what it loving into the verbosity of and i mean that in the long winded meaning of but as pointed using verbs like you did a lot of reflection work in feel like crying when you see how simple the same stuff is in luck with

previous answers are good extension methods apply nicely my first thought was that inheritance a great choice to begin since not really creating a different kind of bitmap you just want to package up some code to manipulate in other words no need to pass a class to you can just pass the modified bitmap in place of the you really were intending to override some of methods with your i would look carefully again at what trying to accomplish for something as complex as image manipulation you might be better served by supplying functionality alongside the original methods as opposed to superseding

previously clients is not for nio augmented with a separate threadpool to handle each request without blocking the nio is usual way to handle a large amount of depending on threads might actually but it depends a lot on how much interaction there is between client massive threads are more likely to work if there is little synchronization between the nio is notoriously difficult to get right the first time you implement recommend either trying or at least looking at the source for the naga nio lib at the codebase for the lib is small compared to most other nio you should be able to quickly implement a test to see if you can get clients up and naga source also happens to be free to modify or copy without attributing the original

primary question is which approach is developing an application using have this one module where i capture some data and store it in the data comes in no duplicates are to be for discussion sake we can assume a table with just one and name that column is named so if we get a keyword already in database we do not store it and we have set this column as primary key and made it query i have before i insert this new data into the shall i do a db call and check if the keyword exists or if it exists put it into something i just insert and let the database handle the effectively letting it throw an which i try catch keyword know catching an exception and not doing anything is so not looking for what is good and what is bad what i want to understand is which approach would be the in relation to javascript and sqlite but general comments are syntax used is just for illustration you may assume that i create sql execute them and fetch the or assume it is a javascript library call which does all the dirty question is a bit like this i check for db constraints in code or should i catch exceptions thrown by i want to understand the performance related differences as the application working on needs to be as fast as possible application and javascript checking for existence of data before inserting or letting sqlite throw an

probably leave the employeestatus codes in the db and move all localization logic into the if this is a web app or then use the the employeestatus code as a key into a resource and then use and to tell to pick up the right resources based upon the http provide default resources embedded in your and allow satalite assemblies to override the defaults where they for with adding localization into the db is that you firstly end up with much more complicated you have to keep pumping the locale into each of these and you cache the outputs of the queries so you have a mixure of tables that hold entities and tables that hold a dba is required to do the you want someone who understands how to translate text to do the and for them to use some tool that comfortable there are plenty of tools out and apps that allow language experts to their stuck with db tables for localization because how it then perhaps you should query the lookups seperately to the real and join the two at the this would at least give you an to in the should check out guy book on i18n if interested in this

problem is better solved with a combination of good communication of a system model and favor of the confirmation mechanism speaks the simplicity of from point of view the easiest way of shifting responsibility onto asked you if you really want to shoot yourself into the now there is no one to blame but user point of is a productivity penalty of having to confirm operation twice every time even though actual mistakes take up just a fraction of total number of any switching of breaking the habitual workflow or inserting a pause into confirmation just increases the mechanism really provide much safety net for frequent users whose reflexes work ahead of the concious personally i have many times done a complex sequence of actions only to realise a moment later when observing the consequences that my brain somehow took the wrong better for the but more complex software development point of solution would possible communicate in advance what exact affect the action is going to make on the system instance stack overflow shows message preview above post your answer an immediate feedback to confirm once the action took place highlights the freshly submitted gmail displayes a confirmation when a message is sent to undo or correct possible mistake in so case delete or edit the windows lets restore a file from recycle bin for certain actions still possible to give an undo capability but for a limited timeframe only letting to cancel or change an online order during the first 10 minutes after its or letting to recall an during the first 60 seconds after its been but actually queued in the outbox this is much more initial work than inserting a confimation message but instead of shifting the responsibility it attempts to solve the

proper way is to look at the http header sent to the this contains the weighted list of languages the user has configured their browser to this header is not available for reading inside all you get is which tells you what localised version of the web browser was this is not necessarily the same thing as the preferred on ie you instead get systemlanguage installed browserlanguage as and userlanguage configured os which are all similarly i had to choose between those sniff for falling back to and only after that those match any available looking at and finally you can put a script somewhere else on the net that simply reads the header and spits it back out as a javascript file with the header value in the you could include a pointing at that external service in the and use javascript to parse the language i know of any existing library code to do since parsing is almost always done on the server you end up you certainly need a user override because it will always guess wrong for some often easiest to put the language setting in the url vs and let the user click links between the sometimes you do want a single url for both language in which case you have to store the setting in but this may confuse user agents with no support for cookies and search

q as select over by companyname order by as over by companyaddress order by as from rnname 1 or rnaddress that if your data will look like companyname companyaddress mcdonalds avenue mcdonalds avenue starbucks avenue then both records and will be deleted is what you requested but probably not what you you just want to list all rows having then company select from company where and and and or select from company where and and and will work in server indexes on and will greatly improve this

query a type that mapped is what the attribute afaik you get nhibernate to create a new arbitrary object instance like that via hql stand to be corrected if someone knows best bet is to do a projection query and then have a method to map the tuples returned into instances of your answer shows how to do a projection query and map it to an anonymous what you want to do is not much you could then put a method to do this in a repository or a extension method to the generic

question is only looking for on the direction of mvc as a i truly am not posting it as my company is planning a major web application investment and we need to decide if mvc is the right head of posted this on his mvc is a microsoft product enables developers to easily build applications using as long as the above statement is true then mvc is safe to deploy mvc is released under the public is an open source the contains no platform restrictions and provides broad rights to modify and redistribute the source microsoft released mvc under open source licensing my first thought was that ms might soon drop support for and with that thought i want to invest in mastering it for obvious could be so i wanted to get some feedback before making any solid this a good friend asked a compelling question about this is mvc open source or shared that got me thinking about the difference between open initiatives and the open source if you open and this difference really gets at the niggling concern over microsoft open sourcing an important not that having access to the source is that is i wish we had access to win32 or even the entire source code for talk about solving problems the concern is over whether ms will now take a posture towards in that case i know if we should use it as it could take awhile for robust community support to build around a source collection originally owned by a company not generally known for giving away source mvc is now is this a good

question seems to be it worth learning wsgi and doing everything or using a stack framework that does everything for say a false dichotomy and an obvious third turbogears 2 tries to provide a smooth path from a everything for style framework up to an understanding of wsgi and an ability to customize almost every aspect of the framework to suit your may not be successful in every place at every but particularly if already got some turbogears 1 experience i think the tg2 learning curve will be very easy at first and have the ability to go deeper exactly when you need address your particular provide an authorization system out of the box that matches the one used to from provide an out of the box like interface called the which works great with dojo to make a fancy spreadsheet like interface the also like to address a couple of the other options that are out there and talk a little bit about the i think cherrypy is a great webserver and a nice minimalistic not based on wsgi internally but has good wsgi support although it will not provide you with the but for custom setups that need to be both fast and particularly suited to the defaults provided by django or a great i think django is a very tigtly integrated system for developing if your application and style of working fits well within standard setup it can be if however you need to tune your db replace the template use a different user authorization model or otherwise do things differently you may very likely find yourself fighting the pylons like cherrypy is a great minimalistic unlike cherrypy wsgi enabled through the whole system and provides some sane defaults like sqlalchemy and mako that can help you scale the new official docs are of much better quality than the old wiki docs which are what you seem to have looked

question that the answers given so far seem to if the runtime libraries the can keep track of the number of things in the then why do we need the syntax at why a single form be used to handle all answer to this goes back to roots as a language it no longer really strives to philosophy was that the programmer should not have to pay for any features that they if not using then they should not have to carry the cost of object arrays for every allocated chunk of if your code simply foo new the memory space allocated for include any extra overhead that would be needed to support arrays of only array allocations are set up to carry the extra array size you then need to tell the runtime libraries to look for that information when you delete the why we need to of bar is a pointer to an most of us that fussiness about a few extra bytes of memory seems quaint these but there are still some situations where saving a few bytes what could be a very high number of memory can be

quick search for results in this like precision of that timer on an iphone is only ns maybe that may explain the large it explain that there is a difference at three main reasons are execution paths during renderbuffer a lot can happen in 1ms and just because you call the same functions with the same parameters mean the exact same instructions are this is especially true if other hardware is there is always something else going on that distracts the as far as i know the iphone os is not a os and so no guarantee that any operation will complete within a certain time limit even a os will have time there are any other opengl calls still being processed by the gpu that might delay the easiest to just call before getting the start

rather like to know whether there are ways to avoid a complete rewrite in one shot when migrating to to our fogbugz codebase was written in classic asp and when we wanted to offer it on the simplest solution was to write a compiler which read the asp and emitted it that and take more than a few upside was when we decided to switch our entire application to it only meant tweaking the compiler a bit to output object to get back to your asp and php are very very similar and depending on your app there are really naive translators that might get you most of the way

reading descriptions of how gc and the part about how objects end up in generation and the collection of loh objects happens at full collection only as does collection of generation the idea that springs to mind why not just keep generation 2 and large objects in the same as going to get collected what actually happens then it would explain how small objects end up in the same place as the loh if long lived enough to end up in generation so your problem would appear to be a pretty good rebuttal to the idea that occurs to me it would result in the fragmentation of the your problem be explained by the loh and generation 2 sharing the same heap although that is by no means proof that this is the the output of pretty much blows this theory out of the the generation 2 and loh have their own

really depends on your site and your seen a site peek out at over 350 active connections to sql during its peak that was for roughly concurent web on two web plus various backend additional information that we need to give you a better many web processes hit your for example are you using do you have multiple many if you this is important because then you can calculate how many connections you can have by figuring out how many worker threads per process you have assume worse each thread is running which would add a connection to the you using connection if so your going to see the connections stick around after the request by default its many concurent users do you i think your going after this your having an issue with no free connections available in your the first thing look for is any leaked connections being held open for longer then they for example passing a data reader up to the web could be a sign of thing is to evaluate the default maybee you should run a web garden which should give you more or increase the number of connections last thing i would do is try to opitmize queries like in your last say you cut those queries in all done is bought yourself more time until more users come onto the and your right back only this time you might not be able to optimize that query yet

really idisposable from some classes need to be like and the most efficient way is to do it in the method to avoid the overhead of but this method must be called so exactly as in your example the classes that encapsulate or contain idisposable have to dispose so they have to be disposable as the only way to avoid it is using idisposable classes where lock or wait for events in single keep expensive resources in single them only when you need them and dispose them just after some cases idisposable can be ignored because it supports an optional for waithandle implements idisposable to support a named if a name is not being the dispose method does memorystream is another it uses no system resources and its dispose implementation also does careful thinking about whether an unmanaged resource is being used or not can be so can examining the available sources for the libraries or using a

really odds are if your program is this the it should be noted that you make a completely equal is more similar to this example will use it it qstring your code macro is able to do this by using some compiler extensions to get the type of the container also imagine that is very similar in reason why your example fair is that your version is adding extra are indexing instead of really if you are using a type with allocation suspect this might be the case with then indexing will be more expensive since the code has to calculate the item are indexing using the function instead of this function is usually implemented in such a way that is more expensive than this because least the are required to do bounds checking in this all indexes are in and potentially throw an does not have this requirement it is legal for it to do the bounds but that make sense in practice because that goes against being it the timing difference between those two pieces of code will be negligible if existent at waste your time worrying about write whichever you find more clear and as a currently i strongly favor the version of container it is concise and you code	
really quite easy to a on your computer without paying a hosting a computer connected to the internet that runs a from a call it to have an ns record that points users to the computer from step that any subdomain queries like and will get sent to that dns entries on the computer from step 1 to send users to the right like redirect all to your done any dns requests that query for will get sent to your and it will reply with gets tricker if you have a static ip for the computer from step but there are free services to get around such as seeing how cheap hosting is you might be better off just hosting it really saves your a lot of extra at a small cost to after the i realize you may have meant just setting up a dns domain within your lan or some other private i think the threw me

really tried audiofilestream api for this rolled our own but a few things you have to take care you have no problem the byte then you have to keep tracking the relationship between mp3 frame number and the absolute byte stream just as paul i assume you can do that in your by calling audiofilestreamseek along the the trickier when you do random you have to reset the internal states of because it might be in some intermediate state expecting the next incoming bytes to complete the current not sure if you can just feed zeros to have it skip the current and start over you have to as i see anything like audiofilestreamreset in the the audio queue does have reset function that you can clean up at any rate you have to take care of your too because going to parse a part of the byte stream which you already have kept track you just find the start of a mp3 frame by relying on the second and the even with rate mp3 there can be paddings every other few so the most accurate information still comes from the should quickly add that another way to do random seeking is simply the parsed packets if not playing a really long and large frame index can be calculated from the frame header for non vbr frames per second is a constant frames per sec for khz stereo check out mp3 spec for why

reason for this is because is defined as a value on and a value on when the 4th argument is passed into the variadic the upper bits appear to be the 4th and 5th values that are pulled out are can solve this problem with a simple cast on all the such does not answer all my such is it the 4th likely because the first 3 are in does one avoid this situation in a portable this happen on other using values that might be on some i pull out the values as values regardless of the target and will that cause problems if a value is pushed into the variadic do the standards say about this really wanted to get a quote from but something not and costs money to and therefore i believe quoting it would be a copyright the made clear that when writing a function that takes a number of nothing you can do for type up to the caller to sure that each argument either perfectly matches or is explicitly there are no implicit much should be obvious to those who understand c and that gcc has a feature to format but not so obvious is that not only are the types not implicitly but if the size of the types match you can have uninitialized or undefined behavior in the where an argument is placed might not be initialized to and there might not be a some platforms you could pass a and extract two values inside the variadic undefined

reason is that you specify a on your the radius is anything less than 100 when the property will make it jump up to 100 and likely cause a you have two competing animations and the mouse events go crazy as the ellipse radius flickers underneath the solution is to just omit the this will cause the animation to start from wherever the current radius describes an an unrelated when you set it speed up your child it will just end the you really want to set on your child modified the xaml above to do	
reason not a compilation is because perfectly valid to send a message not known at compile time to any object any object can be configured to handle messages dynamically as all method calls are really messages being sent to if you see any warnings you should address as in most cases they can lead to problems you the misleading aspect is here is that if you compile a file once and it has only if you compile other classes without making changes to the class that has the warning will not show in the compiler so every now and then you may want to all and build again to make sure you miss any helmstetter

remember the old effective approach of studying a new it was always the best way to read a good book on the say when i tried to skip a lot of material to speed up coding it turned out later that it would be quicker to read the whole book there was no good ways to study a framework in small or at least i did not see them last years a lot of new things improved search results from programming much more people involved in internet a lot of open source now when we write software we much often depend on open and a lot of times we need to know only a small amount of their functionality to use just about finding the simplest way of using a small subset of the library without unnecessary do you do to study as less as possible of the framework and still use it suppose you need to index a set of documents with and you need to highlight search you care about storing the index in one file multiple fuzzy queries and a lot of other stuff that is going to occupy your brain if you study lucene in what are your tricks to save your will enumerate what i would though i feel that my process can be highlight and so try to estimate trust score of unofficial articles blog posts based on publishing the number and the tone of the if there is no a definite answer collect new search keywords and links on the for really quick newbie guides on official how valuable are javadocs for a highlight package for simple examples that come with a related to what you study about lucene search highlighting in lucene mail you can get no answer or even get a bad reputation if you ask a silly and often you know whether you question is silly because you have not studied the framework in it on stackoverflow or other qa service you give me a working example of search keywords highlighting in however this question is very specific and can gain no answers or a bad how easy to get the answer from the framework code if open are your search write them in priority order if strategies for studying libraries

rotate an you create 3 rotate that around to get the new rotated image you do abc around a in so this is a single euler in the rotated state from a to for every pixel you traverse also from left to right over the horizontal line in the original so if the image is an image of width height traverse from a to b in 100 steps and from a to c in 50 drawing 50 lines of 100 pixels in the area formed by abc in their rotated might sound complicated but please see this code i wrote some time by i alter the source pointers a bit to get a but if you disable see the code rotates the image without of on some angles get an image which looks slightly the sourcecode contains comments going on so you should be able to grab the behind it you like java i also have made a java version 14 or so years ago

run into similar things in my two things found with that helped me the be afraid necessarily of memory allocations are very so allocating an array on the fly can often be faster than making an whether this will help depends a lot on how using the the only pitfall i see is if you return a fixed size array going to have to check for edge cases in the routine using your on how large your matrix of squares is in your you may be better off doing 1 check up front to see if on the and if precomputing the full array and returning if on an you can handle those special cases separately a 1 or 2 element array as this would put one larger statement in but that is often faster in my if the model is i would avoid precomputing all of the the overhead in the squares may outweigh the my as preallocating and returning using yield makes the jit more likely to inline your which can make a big difference in if you can take advantage of the ienumerable results and you are not always using every returned that is but precomputing may be other thing to consider i know what information is saved in square in your but if hte object is relatively and being used in a large matrix and iterated over many consider making it a i had a routine similar to this hundreds of thousands or millions of times in a and changing the class to a in my sped up the routine by over this is assuming using as the jit does many more optimizations on structs in the latest are other potential pitfalls to switching to struct of but it can have huge performance

running a fairly complex app as a portlet on websphere portal server on aix using ibm jdk on our production system i can see a strange behaviour in the verbose gc after a period of normal behaviour the system can start rapidly allocating larger and larger the system starts to spend 1000 ms to complete each but blocks are being allocated so quickly that there is only a 30 ms gap between allocation allocation failure slightly larger than the last by some integer amount x 1024 you might have 5 and then a short while later 5 mb 17 can go on for up to 10 blocks tend to grow up to 8 to 14 mb in size before it a and i assume that now spending of time doing gc with three cores waiting for the other core to complete for 10 system performance dies at this have hibernate web services log4j output and not much interpret this as likely to be something infrastructural rather than our application if it was a bad string concatenation inside a loop we would expect more irregular growth than blocks of if it was stringbuffer or arraylist growth we would see the block sizes the growth is making me think of log buffering or something i think of anything in our app that allocations even 1 let alone today i looked for logging backing up in memory before being flushed to but the volume of logging statements over this period of gc thrashing was nowhere near the mb the problem is with the excessive memory allocation rather than with the garbage which is just doing its best to keep something is allocating a large block and trying to grow it inefficiently in increments that are far too ideas what might be causing all this when the system is under anybody seen anything similar with portal for anybody interested starting to look like the cause is an occasional but enormous database it seems the culprit is either hibernate or the jdbc garbage collection behaviour with websphere portal

seems just like the view rendered before that the backing has completed its only way this could happen is if you did the work in another thread but it look like you are doing am but it looks like a logic problem in your backing is your keeping that phase of the lifecycle causes to be created in the request scope phase of the lifecycle needs to iterate over every fetches the rows from the persistence store and they are cached in the bean we get to the removes the target row from the persistence but does not do anything about the cached bean phase renders the stale cached bean you refresh the bean gets recreated with new cached values and you see the correct backing bean recreates the class deletefromrowbean private listdatamodel public datamodel if list datamodel new return public string if throw new rowbean row return no navigation the list while the data table is iterating over it is not a good idea get concurrent modification the easiest solution in my sample bean is just to release the reference to the cached the data table already has a reference to this for the duration of the iteration in the when the the data table will call causing the new state to be fetched from the persistence class deletefromrowbean private listdatamodel public datamodel if list datamodel new return public string if throw new rowbean row flush cached datamodel return no navigation

setting up a large database that will generate statistical reports from incoming system will for the most part operate as rows about 30 mostly and datetime will be uploaded each its approximately 60mb while in flat file but grows steeply in the db with the addition of suitable statistics will be generated from the current from these statistics will be generated and data set will get copied into a partitioned history the the current data set was not can be queried by end users for information that is not likely to include but relationships between may request specialized searches from the history but the queries will be crafted by a the next the current data table is will essentially be version 2 of our existing using mysql myisam tables was killing on space usage and suffering greatly on and is currently not a partitioned tabled as support in order to get around the tremendous amount of time and its taking to insert records into writing each day to an unindexed and then on the weekends during our slowest writing the queue to the history the problem is that any historical queries generated in the week are possibly several days behind we reduce the indexes on the historical table or its queries become definitely moving to at least mysql we stay with for the next release but strongly considering i know that debate has been done to but i was wondering if anybody had any advice relevant to this most of the research is revolving around web site indexing is really our main beef with mysql and it seems like postgresql may help us out through partial indexes and indexes based on read dozens of articles about the differences between the but most are postgresql has long been labeled but is that still generally the case comparing mysql to postgresql or is it more balanced databases and ms are simply not an option although i wish oracle on myisam vs innodb for were running innodb and for we found it much like times we were also much newer to mysql and frankly not sure we had db tuned appropriately for running in an environment with a very high degree of uptime battery network backup fully redundant so the integrity concerns with myisam were weighed and deemed regards to heard the stability issues concern with generally i assume that any recently last 12 piece of software is not the updated feature set in is just too much to pass up given the chance to the regards to postgresql without any where clause is a pretty rare case for i anticipate this being an from nearly as flexible as load data infile but an intermediate loading table will fix biggest concern is the lack of insert often used it when building some processing table so that we could avoid putting multiple records in twice and then having to do a giant group by at the end just to remove some i think its used just infrequently enough for the lack of it to be for

setting up some selenium tests for an internal web app and looking for advice on a testing one of the tests is going to add some data via the ui that cannot be removed via the ui you can add a record via the web but removing requires contacting someone internally to remove it at the database how do you typically account for cleaning up data after the selenium test is app in question is written in php and using php for testing selenium rc and but open to other as this is just a broad best practice the app being tested is in our development so not particularly worried about data carrying over from connect to the database in the selenium test to cleanup the something like to manage add data and worry about cleaning it up the lazy seems most of the ideas centered around the same work off a known set of data and restore when the tests are the mechanism for this probably will vary depending on amount of but this looks like it should work for my up data after a selenium

shared functionality back to a framework or library with defined interfaces and default implementations is a common way to handle for your plugin if you choose to support is probably something that could be shared among all of your most of the time the things you want to share are pretty basic functionality or relatively abstract functionality that can be easily the former are easier to recognize and factor out to common the latter may sometimes be more work than simply the code with minor changes patterns rather than thing you want to be careful of is to let the actual drive the design of common libraries rather than coming up with a shared architecture in very tempting to get caught up in framework design and abstracting it out for shared unfortunately you often find that the shared use never develops or develops in a different direction than you expected and you end up rewriting or throwing away much of the framework or even keeping and maintaining unused let yagni gonna need be your guide and delay refactoring to common libraries until you actually have a

should definitely follow the advice from javier a registry of factories is the right way to go for this implemented it that way many times in the be for format translation or some other extensible based factory solution automatic gui generation based on reflection would however suggest one addition to the design the introduction of a common domain model that is targeted by all say that you have formats b and c an that you need to support transformation between each you get all the the number of format you get an explosion of a better idea is to separate each transformation into two parts lets call it an and an the importer converts a format to the common domain model while an export converts the from the cdm to some an we decompose the conversion from a to b into the cdm is an b is an when you want to add a new format you need only write an importer and an exporter but you get translation all other talk about it also allows for formats for which yo can read but not write and vice the solution would be to have a registry of importer factories and a registry of exporter

should definitely use the expression with the not because faster but because you accidentally use one equals sign instead of you assign the value to the variable instead of comparing the other data types the compiler can catch as an expression like has an integer value so it be used in the if but an expression like has a boolean value so the compiler has to accept old c trick is to put the literal first so that it be an but that is less readable so the operator is a better

singleton is used when you cannot have more than one object say a class obviously two or more are going to wreck your for a you cannot create any more than one object by definition function scope local objects are a different beast this idiom does not preclude the possibility of having other such objects this is often found in case of classes where you can create your own objects and the library writer also provides you with a function for quick and ugly logging which just wraps over a that some implementations of a singleton object accessor can use the function scope variable	
site has many style sheets customized for varying screen as the browser is the event checks that a resize actually took place by looking at if it it turns on successively larger style sheets until scrollbars it turns them off in reverse order until scrollbars scrollbars are detected by comparing offsetwidth to two new problems confound detection of a onresize fires whenever scrollbars appear or and reports the width without a break from ie7 and all other my site now frequently gets trapped in a loop in which the onresize logic activates a larger style which creates which then triggers another resize event that cannot be filtered out because the clientwidth has changed due to scrollbars appearing or this would be a trivial fix if ie8 had something like outerwidth i could can i detect if the window really resized in ie8 standards

so there were a couple of things wrong with my original no i had to add an internal test to verify that my code could encrypt and decrypt before wrapping it in that was silly of the transformfinalblock method of both the encryptor and decryptor objects seem to perform as the function cleartext as byval key as as prepare dim keybytes dim sourcebytes prepare encryption dim aes new dim encryptor dim ms new dim cs new dim encrypted decrypted not log as new return function base64cipher as byval key as as dim keybytes dim cipherbytes prepare decryption dim aes new dim decryptor dim ms new dim cs new dim decryptedbytes as redim dim readbytecount dim decrypted return be modifying this code to bump up the aes algorithm to and cbc cipher which requires an initial vector this adds a level of complexity to the implementation that i ready to add until the rest worked of the to all those who commented on my

solution below assumes that the lower 16 bits of the unicode space will be enough for if your bitmap table say through at positions 0x00 to 0x5e and through at positions 0x5f to 0xbe and through at 0xbf to you could do something like the code below not even contains a series of pairs of the first value in the first pair is the unicode code point which the bitmap at index 0 the assumption is that the bitmap table contains a series of directly adjacent unicode code so the second value says how long this series first part of the while loop iterates through input and builds up a unicode code point in once a complete character is the second part searches for that character in one of the ranges mentioned in if it finds an appropriate bitmap it adds it to characters for which no bitmap is present are silently function returns the number of bitmap indexes way of doing things should be in terms of the reasonably fast and reasonably code below assumes but is about three from assuming an unsigned short is short char unsigned short int int unsigned char unsigned short while if while else if this is invalid do our if if our work here is done no char at this we have a complete char in unsigned short unsigned short while if return you mentioned that you need more than the lower 16 in the above code and it can then do the whole unicode

solution i have seen utilized by commercial windows libraries is naming the solution files with the vs version as a suffix you still have to keep them in but you have to change file or include or modify the actual solution files just keep multiple one for each vs version which is you have to do the same thing for the project but at least you have to change the contents around to support different directory structures unless you want to support building with multiple vs and in the case where you do you only have to change the output settings for each different project saying a great but rather just another	
solution in is a solution using the extension result keystring str is no linq syntax for the aggregate clause in apparently there is in for some predefined solution might look somewhat but the aggregate method is quite aggregate works like if you have a you can combine all values into a aggregate is in contrast to the which modify the length of the or the which does shrink the but it still remains a list of a single if you have a list you can combine them into a single value like xs sum sumsofar you give two values to the a seed value and a start aggregating with a single seed value in this combiner function gets called for each value in the first argument is the computed result so far the first later this will have other and it combines it with the value in short how the method works on it works the same on but just with different	
solution in use where i work is automated nightly build and test out trunk head code from source project and load onto pc controlled automated test test scripts are easy to run if you are using some sort of communication good for internal unit what makes the situation more interesting is to make a wiring harness that plugs into the board to simulate external is good for development and basic initial but real physical operating time is the only reliable method for system physical operation can ferret out issues by coding such as voltage debounce race system testing is important as setting up an automated test to abuse a system continuously for straight is a good way to force out issues that may not crop up until several months later in the telling a customer to just cycle power whenever things start acting funny is not a luxury that all industries can

solved this problem by chaining the use of an air html control in conjunction to use of swfloader to then load the desired remote wrote a javascript function on an html web page that my air app loads into an html instance the page complete event it is then safe to call the javascript function from air flex code the flex code of handle the html complete javascript function uses to login to the web site that uses spring security for a header gets processed upon a successful when the response for the is complete then a synthetic click event is dispatched on a dummy div object that has been placed on the web air flex code is able to register for and process this synthetic click processing the click the air flex code then knows it is safe to proceed to instantiate a swfloader when the complete event from the swfloader object then the object reference of the swfloader is placed in the air app display user then sees the remotely loaded swf file begin to execute and show its own it is running in a remote sandbox the feature is supported in flex sdk via the swfloader the air app is managing the cookie header that was established by the html that cookie header is emitted in the http request of the swfloader control when it is used to load the remote spring security filter sees this and finds the request to be from an authenticated user

some time ago and had a series of blog posts incrementally optimising a file load into a dictionary while was quicker early on easy to make the approach eventually was significantly faster but at considerable complexity using custom the end the answer to which is faster will heavily depend on how much time you are willing to expend on eking every microsecond out of each that effort you do it guided by real profiler will make a far greater difference than choice of first and last performance blog part part final final last link gives an overall summary of the results and some

someone said they had 2 years of experience in but understand the ins and outs of constructors destructors and it would not prevent me from hiring this is the type of knowledge that can be easily learned and consists of a few simple would certainly like them to have that knowledge but not having it does not make them a bad or lazy worked with excellent programmers that spent the majority of their time in old school com and hresult this makes heavy use of but virtually eliminates there is no need or reason for them to have learned once we introduced exceptions into the code it took about 15 minutes to get everyone on board with the constructor destructor would much rather use an interview to test a persons problem solving skills than to see if they knew the ins and outs of a particular part of it is so easy to teach but so hard to teach problem

someone to deal with the business issues related to contract programming might be a good idea if you feel that this is something you do well or want to paying of the contract for it seems unless actually a if thinking of a partnership that would require a lot more thinking about how well you would work together and some reasonable estimate of how much work you would each actually i want to put someone between the client and myself with regard to the requirements and i think just a recipe for building the wrong advocate for a closer relationship with the client rather than isolating your friend is willing to go out and find business and needs you to actually get the job suggest that you might want to contract with him at the rate that makes sense for you do to the that your contract ought to be with he can add whatever premium seems reasonable and the actual client will on being able to deal directly with the client on the technical	
someone unauthorized got into the it too late to worry about assuming a poor database design in which the authorization data is comingled with application of principle and the principle suggest that user credentials should be kept separate from everything keep your user credentials in an ldap your question assumes that database credentials are the only the least access principle suggests that you have application credentials which are separate from database web application username and password is not the database username and similarly for a desktop the application authentication may not necessarily be the database good security suggests that access to usernames and passwords be kept separate from application in a large organization with lots of database one admin should be and handle authentication and no other users can modify authorization and the security officer is not authorized to access application a quick audit to be sure that the security officer never accesses a little more but another audit can be sure that the folks with data authorization are real not aliases for the security passwords is one part of a working security

sometimes things should not be the reference to a great in a function to know that your argument be because it allows use to have something that really is a but which acts like a local value tries to quote to make class instances as the ints passing an int by vaue is because an int fitss into a machine classes are often bigger than and passing them by value has significant able to pass a pointer is often the size of an or maybe two that a value object allows us to write cleaner without the of along with operator it allows us to write classes use syntax similar to the syntax used with in it allows us to write template classes with syntax that can be equally applied to like and classes a complex number with operator overloading there are places were we should return an but much cheaper to return a oncve returning a reference is our pointers are not for and not to anyone that realizes a pointer is just the value of a memory but recalling my cs 101 they tripped up a number of p i be after 40 years of people still even agree if a pointer declaration should

sounds like your main complaint so much with the abstraction of but with the language syntax for using prefer something like style this is the then the java language has relatively little to offer direct field access is until you need to switch to a getter or and then you will have some refactoring to do if you control the whole if the java platform is a but the language then there are other scala has a very nice property for along with lots of other features that could be useful for such a and best of it runs on the so you still get the same portability that get by writing it in the java

specify the size of your or what is the size of your character set so it is difficult to estimate the size would store the bitmaps in a straight array depending on the size of the it might store fairly efficiently without the need to if we take a 36 character alphabet with a 8x6 you need 216 bytes of storage for the 36 each byte would be a vertical slice of the the it is simply a matter of doing offset in the old and tricks do quite other question is where to store the bitmap rom is the obvious but if you need to support other glyphs it might need which you specify if an the glyphs must be programmed then you have a choice but to put it in

subversion all others are not source code control managers always thought scm means software configuration but version control means they store changes to the stuff you store in it have to be source it could be image bitmap configuration files or all kinds of only 1 reason why built binaries be considered as part of this and because you can rebuild think why you would want to store the released binaries in there as its a system to assist not to tell you how you should build your make the computer work for instead of against so what if storing binaries takes up space you have hundreds of gigabytes of disk space and super fast its not a big deal to store binary objects in there anymore ten years ago it might have been a problem this is perhaps why people think of binaries in scm as a bad as a you might be comfortable with using the system to rebuild any version of an but the others who might use it might this means need an alternative system to store the and you already have such a its your make use of you assume that you rebuild from obviously you store all the source code in but you store the the the and the other dependant bits that are what happens when someone comes along and asks you build me the version we shipped 2 years a customer has a problem with that 2 years is an eternity do you even have the same compiler you used back what happens when you check all the source out only to find that the newly updated sdk is incompatible with your source and fails with do you wipe your development box and reinstall all the dependencies just to build this can you even remember what all the dependencies last point is the big to save a few k of disk you might cost yourself days if not weeks of law also says that whichever app you need to rebuild will be the one that required the most difficult to set up dependency you were ever glad to get rid store the binaries in your worry over we stick all binaries in their own directory per then when we want to update a we use a special project that consists of nothing but you export the setup project and done as it fetches the right things and puts them into the right directory

taken a long look around and find any information on altering managed resources in assemblies that already familar with win32 resources and the apis for altering application has resources that need to be updated by the end user and the application will be distributed as a single executable i just use satellite see a few possible but they seem first is to use create a new assembly which contains the new resources and use ilmerge to combine it with the original assembly to form the new the only downside is that resources cannot be updated or second is somewhat there would be a from the which is ran against with the switch to add the resources to form the new the downside being that none of the resources in the original assembly would be leaning towards the ilmerge but the terms on redistribution are the eula makes no reference to redistribution rights i assume in this negative freedom society that yet the microsoft research page says redistribution is not permitted ambiguously from what i can tell it might be referring to commercial which apply to me since this is a gpl can i and update resources in clr

team current is currently in the fixing and phase of shipping a major we still have a large stack of bugs to scheduled against a couple of been asked to come up with of how much engineering effort is required to fix the bugs for each previous followed the following the bugs to the people that know the most about that area of the and will likely be the one to fix the each person go through the bugs that are assigned to and estimate how long they think it will take to fix the at an if a bug looks like it will potentially take more than a day or two to they break the bug into likely and estimate the amount of work assigned to each person for each and try and balancing things out if people have drastically different amounts of each total for each milestone by a to account for overly optimistic estimates been using the largest total across the team members for a given and make that the time it will take for the team to close the existing the number of bugs we expect to be created during the time it takes us to reach a particular and estimate how long on we think it will take to close each of these add this on to the time to close the existing bugs for each this is our final number of the amount of work delivered as a date by which definitely ship that has been fairly accurate come in pretty much spot on on our previous three but rather time been asked to give estimates of the engineering time for upcoming but asked not to use the above process because too time as the tech lead of the been asked to provide estimates that are less along with a certainty interval 1 plus or minus a primary estimation experience is with some variation of the method i described above a background of freelancing for a number of found that when i from the on large i tend to be way i suspect it will be even worse when estimating how long it takes to fix bugs in areas of the code i know very tricks or techniques have you found successful for estimating without breaking things down into fine grained tasks and estimating that are not an giving an estimate tried it a number and confidence interval that is ridiculously wide considered but i think fly scheduling using which have any scheduling tools written for and we migrate to fogbugz currently if someone goes and writes an scheduling plugin for we would gladly pay for the best way to do estimates without spending a lot of

technical answer to your original question is a qualified all objects opened from an are automatically disposed when the is in practice it is a good idea to dispose an as soon as done with it to reduce memory especially when working with code like this that opens several this behavior for linq is actually quite simple in you can find full details in but the short version is that a iterator can handle disposal for using my extension your code is relatively safe written like spsite var sw from spweb web in where from spweb subweb in select asubweb in do the result of your which assigned to is a lazy iterator of type as you enumerate over that each will be disposed when the enumerator moves to the next this means that it is not safe to use that or any object created from it outside of your also would not be safe to use outside of that block because the will be tied to the code like this that enumerates over all webs is extremely there is almost certainly a more efficient way that this could be if only by using instead of your garbage these objects require disposal because of unmanaged memory allocated that the gc even know a word of caution about your if using in your helper method to get your elevated there are a number of issues you could run into by returning your out of that elevated if i would suggest using impersonation instead my preferred method is described

tells core start running this core not it only knows about executable code and various running levels and associated limitations to instructions that can be computer for sake of simplicity only one is active and actually runs any then if os is multiprocessor it activates other cores with some system specific other cores most likely pick up from exactly same spot as other core and run from what scheduler does is it looks through os internal structures and picks one and marks it as running at its then other scheduler instances running on other cores touch it until the task is in waiting state again not marked as pinned to specific after task is marked as scheduler executes switch to userland with task resuming at the point it was previously there is nothing whatsoever stopping cores from running exact same code at exact same time many unlocked functions but unless code is written to expect it will probably piss all over goes weirder with more exotic memory models assumes linear single working memory where cores necessarily all see same memory and there may be requirements on fetching code from other but much easier handled by simply keeping task pinned to core sony ps3 architecture with is like	
template pattern is used when a particular operation has some invariant that can be defined in terms of other varying primitive the abstract class defines the invariant while the implementing classes defined the dependent in a the behavior implementations are independent each implementing class defines the behavior and there is no code shared between both are behavioral patterns as are consumed in much the same way by typically strategies have a single public method the whereas templates may define a set of public methods as well as a set of supporting private primitives that subclasses must two patterns could easily be used you might have a strategy pattern where several implementations belong to a family of strategies implemented using a template

that should be posible with some of dealying the you can stop it before it reaches original clone it and then refire the clone after the you know how events work in the displaylist you can in flash let me first explain you click a button a mouseevent is it begin in the capturing fase where it starts on the stage calling all eventlisteners registered for the event in the order of the priority set when the listeners was if listerners has the same priority default is the are called in a random order the order that they where all listeners for the stage has been called the next displayobject in the list of the buttons ancestors is and the same thing happens continue all the way down to inner most displayobject that allow mouse events be a textfield label inside the the capturing phase ends and the target phase all the listeners on the innermost object is called in the target the bubbling phase where all the listernes are called on parents and grandparents all the way up to the stage in the same manner as before from the inside should be noted that in flash the target phase is handled as part of the bubbling how can we use when you register and event listener you specify the phase and the defaults are bubbling phase and priority so if we register a click event listener on the stage for the capturing phase with priority we would get the event before any other listerne except perhaps another identical following code would prevent click events to registered by other raises some other firstly you want to do it for solution would be be to have of all buttons that should events and it with solution would be to have that require a an interface call and then simple is third solution would be to for the events on a a since it that you would use the it reaches this parent the first two solutions you should prevent mouseinteraction for the children of the buttons to simplify detection matter what you choose next you would have to delay with a simple and then fire the event again after the raises the problem of not delaying the refired my suggestion would be to instead fire an event object that inherits from mouseevent instead of a simple the mouseevent is very simple to it only has a few so when you capture it the second time you can check if its a normal mouse click or your the solution with the inface on the it would be something is idelaybutton is code for the cloning and refiring the event might need to listen for more types of events but most of the code can be made generic enough to include that helps and sorry about the long

the actual reason for using instead of a specific delegate is that treats separately declared delegates as totally different though and both have identical argument and return they are not so if every library declared its own delegate type for each delegate those libraries would not be able to interoperate unless the user inserts delegates to perform declare two delegate completely identical but different public delegate void public delegate void a method that is compatible with either of public static void static void can assign any method having the right exceptionhandler1 x1 and yet cannot assign a delegate with identical exceptionhandler2 x2 error at compile encouraging everyone to use microsoft is hoping that this will alleviate the problem of incompatible delegate delegates will play nicely because they will just be matched up based on their solve all because have or but those are less commonly in the comments svish switching a parameter type func to predicate seem to make at least it still without any as long as your program only assigns methods to as in the first line of my the compiler silently generates code to new a delegate object that forwards on to the so in my i could change to be of type without causing a on the second line i try to assign the first delegate to another even thought that 2nd delegate type has exactly the same parameter and return the compiler gives error cannot implicitly convert type to this will make it static bool return x void p f p not method is a perfectly good thing to assign to the and as long as i do so but then i assign one of those variables to the

the buffering inherent in all the stdio i would be tempted to read the stream character by character with a simple finite state machine can identify word and line boundaries if an advantage is the complete lack of buffers to aside from whatever buffer you collect the current word in if your further processing requires might want to do a quick benchmark comparing the time required to read a large file completely with an outside constraint requires that the file really be read a line at a time if you need to handle input from a then probably is your friend as other answers point but even then the approach may be acceptable as long as the input stream is running in mode which is common for stdin if stdin is on a to have control over the buffer on the input you might need to call or to force it to a buffered if the input stream ends up then using an explicit buffer of some form will always be faster than on a raw performance would probably use a buffer related to your disk at least two disk blocks in size and probably a lot more than even that performance can be beat by arranging the input to be a memory mapped file and relying on the paging to read and fill the buffer as you process the file as if it were one giant of the if performance is going to matter then you will want to benchmark several approaches and pick the one that works best in your and even the simplest expression of your problem may still be the best overall answer if it gets debugged and

the examples you i think actually asking what the if is there between using the method and then the difference do stuff and do stuff answer is that it really a matter of the event methods are syntactically simpler and involve less as far as i know there really any i prefer to use the bind methods because you can use shorthand event binding if you need to attach more than one event to the same it also makes it simpler to understand you need to an from what the actual question the difference between the method and the a totally different should never really use the method to attach events because the and methods use the quicker css selector engine it uses the sizzle hardly ever a case where do something is better than do stuff

the process will not pickup where it has it will start over again unless you specificly tell it to start where it this php scruot does the utterly pointless task of adding one to a print you write down the last number when stopping the server and then restart the script with the correct it will start where it has left but only because you made it do the script state is not saved when could also have it safe the current state to the filesystem or database so you have to enter it by so you to stop the if restarting xamp stop it then you will have to give more info on what is happeing since restarting xamp should stop the execution of all php

the pure virtual method called should create a different question as it is in fact different than the the answer to this question is on the very last paragraph of my previous answer to your initial not call virtual functions from constructors or virtual void derived public virtual void derived crashes with pure virtual method problem in the code above is that the compiler will allow you to instantiate an object of type derived it is not all virtual methods are the construction of a class starts with the construction of all the in this case the compiler will generate the virtual method table for type where the entry for is 0 implemented in the compiler will execute the code in the constructor after the base part has completely been construction of the derived element part the compiler will change the virtual table so that the entry for points to you try calling the method while still constructing the entry in the virtual method table is still null and the application

the question of cluttering the code when demonstrating a coding i think the question do you choose to handle the error in your example is to what do you do fatal for one application is for if i retrieve some info from a webserver it a 404 error or a that may be fatal if you do anything without that but if that data is supplementary to what then perhaps you can live without the above may point to simply logging the better than ignoring the error but i think often the difficulty is in knowing when to recover from an perhaps a whole new tutorial in

the recurring billing process is something you run on your you can include these checks as part of your the way i would think about this algorithmically is something each customer billing on their retries to them as a paid to the next their retry an alert to the their retry counter reaches a the switch to mark them as can do the same in batch if something else runs the billing and just tells you the just replace billing on their with results from last billing your retry counter would implement something like a grace assuming your billing runs on a daily so have a chance to fix the billing problem rather than just having their premium features revoked just because their card expired or some

then have no reseatable type which can not be you included 3 types of which would just complicate the language for very little gain then why not add the 4th type reference which can be better question may why would you want references to be if they that would make them less useful in a lot of it would make it harder for the compiler to do alias seems that the main reason references in java or are reseatable is because they do the work of they point to they are not aliases for an should the effect of the following i j with it is j is an alias for and i ends up with the value references had been then the third line would bind the reference j to a different it would no longer alias but instead the integer literal 43 of or perhaps a simpler at least syntactically i k j reseatable j would point to k after evaluating this j still points to and i is assigned the value references reseatable changes the semantics of the the reference can no longer be an alias for another instead it becomes a separate type of with its own assignment and then one of the most common usages of references would be and nothing would be gained in the newly gained functionality for references already existed in the form of so now have two ways to do the same and no way to do what references in the current language

thing that determines how may request are handled simultaneous is the there are a number of different threasholds that will limit the amount of request being this also depends on the binding your are for example wshttpbinding defaults to sessions on while basichttpbinding uses no sessions and the default session limit of 10 is no for more

thing to keep in mind when working with nhibernate is that it deals with entities and only knows what told it the mapping hql is an version of sql so you use it to access fields that part of your mapped domain can still execute plain old sql through an nhibernate session which is really the only way to access data that you mapped into your there might be a lightweight mapping solution i say without seeing your data but if against mapping the i think sql is your best

things as someone above pointed getting the type for not for so will get you the list of and more it looks like misunderstanding the purpose of in general attributes are used to mark a member for specific processing or to add additional here using the name to indicate what processing you and the attribute to specify which is mixing of or answer is more you mark the field as city then do what you like with where i disagree is that i would use different attribute rather than an public class myattribute public class mycityattribute public class public class public string city public string workcity public string fullname public public void type t fields foreach field in attributes if if is for if is for would allow you to use different parameters for mycity vs myname that would make more sense in the context of processing think with your comment you hit the nail on the that you would have to change a string constant if you rename your variable is an indicator that doing something	
things like cookies or doughnuts for however many bugs if you show that you actually appreciate the reviews that the reviewer is it will encourage them to try harder for this a nor will it necessarily work on most of the reviews are they are already busy as hell with their own but if you actively try to engage the reviewers with positive feedback that shows you are taking them very and take you seriously in you only breed case it clear from the rest of my i talking about bribery as being the actual the real solution is engaging the rather than just critiquing the review you in the same vein as reading my whole response rather than just disliking the first word of	
things unlisted is okay if the attendees generally trust the agreed changes to be and tend to agree what the agreement on each issue in the first light approach could be to mark each case as notified but no action from the author be and so this would mean all attendees also are in sync about what really is going to be done on a single too much is sure to make code reviews tedious and which way is best would also have to do with the kind of the project something and whether the people work in the same company or if a subcontracting review money will be paid it

think a right or wrong answer so give you my either solution the account controller or creating a new will work just i think this is more a question of how the users perceive the i think a good idea to follow the convention that the uri dictates the controller vice if you for like to have the actions on a separate then that should be a separate you might want to do for if you use an iis module for authentication or if it makes your log analysis the other it might be the case that the users perceive account functions and administrative functions as part of the same family of except that some users have additional if then that suggests that should be on the same path in the uri part of the same i think this is a question you should ask your user representative instead of folks on this regarding your updated i would say that it is fairly natural to put an action for changing a password on the account and that action could be invoked by the user not just an so i presume that the account controller is strictly for administrative on the other your example of the performance is well outside of the scope of so it is not clear that it belongs on still leaning your user	
think a separate app to do the watchdogging is likely to produce more problems than it suggest that you first create handlers to generate minidumps when the app then add a watchdog thread to the which will deliberately crash if the app goes off the the advantage to the watchdog thread a different is that it should be easier for the watchdog to know for sure that the app has gone off the you have the you can poke around to find out the state when it this should give you enough clues to figure out the or at least where to look some stuff at codeproject about which could be a useful msdn has more information about them as	
think a simple for instance on the platform implements connection pooling by so it will automatically adjust a of connections and them so not constantly creating and destroying expensive say you were writing a data collection application that monitored 200 separate input every time one of those inputs you fire off a thread that records the event to the i would say that could be a bad design if a chance that even a fraction of those could fire off at the same suddenly having 20 or 40 active database connections is it might be better to queue the and as long as there are updates left in the a singleton connection picks them off the queue and executes them on the more efficient because you only have to negotiate the connection and authentication once no activity for a while you could choose to close down the this kind of behavior would be hard to implement without a central resource manager like a

think all qa is developers must test their own code to ensure it does what he thinks it should do and it break the testers should test against the specifications to see if the developer interpreted them correctly testing almost never finds these peers should do code reviews to ensure that standards are followed and to promote users must do testing as well as they will try to do things that nobody expected or defined in the often these are stupid things that make us shake out heads and would anyone every think to do but many others are genuine requirements that were not in the spec because nobody bothered to ask the users what they client acceptance testing should be done especially if you do custom development for different it is far easier to show that a new request for work is new development rather than a if the client has signed off on the work before it went to this can save tons of contractual battles over who is to pay for having someone else fix your bad code is the best way to ensure that bad code will continue to be produced which why i hate the organizational structure that some companies have of having developers who do new things and support people who do further a manager who fixes bad code to save time without sending it back to the developer to fix is causing problems for the organization not fixing big part of qa in my mind is taking the time up front to actually define the requirements and they will change through any large but they still are without testing is random at without standards maintenance can become a nightmare and far more costly than need last part of qa is learning from our unfortunately in many organizations you honestly have a post project discussion of what went wrong and how to prevent that next time without getting into a blame session that causes people be quiet rather than get bad marks against them for their performance in fact performance appraisals in general are harmful to the goal of improving quality for this reason among many up deming and total quality management to see the quality thoughts on the harm caused by performance theory there should be quality metrics that you can use to measure imporved in practice as long as your organization has performance these numbers will often be to make things look better or measure the worng thing lines of code mean better code in all cases and more bug reports might mean we are doing a better job of finding at least the bugs not that the code is worse than in a past and are thus	
think already done the thin controller thing by putting the query into a named scope where it can be here is some code i used before i started using named def describe to get it expose all comms as get would probably write code quite similar to what you have but maybe put it in a helper that allows me to reuse the other thing is to use a different mocking framework that maybe gives you more have a look at ryan railscast on rspec a bit old now but still some good ideas in

think already seen the about tools for migrating vb6 to have published special offer prices for the uk market on their products on this microsoft uk of course you need to know the limitations of the basic products and the prices for your market to make a realistic so you probably do need to contact them upgrade companion developer edition for up to lines of now offering a that can do up to lines of visual basic migration partner professional edition they told me this was also for up to lines of microsoft upgrade wizard is pathetic to the guy who wrote of course he is from artinsoft so he wants to sell you something microsoft uk also the artinsoft and code architects tools are better than the upgrade i contacted code architects for a they responded very unlike this stack overflow by who had a worse but then francesco balena popped up on stack overflow to answer his question within 12 which is more

think commented code in a source code control system should be done with extreme especially if the language tags used to comment the code are written by my commented code start commented code line commented code line than on an individual line my commented code start my commented code line my commented code line get the reason i would use extreme caution is that depending of the you should be very careful about the tool you are with certain source code control system and certain the tool can be easily the standard of clearcase for example is notoriously bad for merging it happens that the commenting blocks lines are not merge presto your code will become active in the system when it if the code is incomplete and break the that is probably the least as you will spot it if the code passes the it may become active when it be and from a cm that could be a nightmare qa generally test what should be they test for code that is not supposed to be so your code may end up in production before you know and by the time it would be realized the code is there when it the cost in maintenance have multiplied many folds the will be discovered in production or by the worst place or time	
think confused because running from the which automatically prints out the value returned when you call a in that you do get identical output whether you have a function that creates a prints and throws it or you have a function that creates a value and returns letting the repl print these are very much not the same as you will realize when you call autoparts with another function that wants to do something with the value that autoparts

think going about this the wrong your plan be to update all current code to java your plan should be to ensure that all current code runs exactly the same in as it did in and that all future code written will work fine in gone through a few transitions like this of varied sized code the goal was always to make sure we had a ton of unit tests so that we could easily plug in and run our tests through we actually encountered about 10 mostly related to regular expression libraries not supporting something or supporting something all new code in and if you change an older class for whatever spend a minute and implement but no reason to refactor that sounds a bit dangerous to me if you have the tests in

think i found a solution to this it sadly involves a temporary but at least prevent the creation of a dreaded cursor you need to do is add an extra column to the table duplicating records from and give it a declare a temporary table the the data into your temp table like into from go ahead and do the real insert into the original into uniqueid from to add the newly created identity values to your temp originaltable o inner join tmp on you have a lookup table that holds the new id and original id in one for your using pleasure hope this helps

think i would find a way to make the data consistent rather than allowing users to enter inconsistent perhaps your management app could allow the manager to select an existing image or upload a new then set the name of the image based on this input so that be assured that the image will only remove an image when all references to it have been removed from the restrict the interaction with the data to your app so that people make those sorts of way to handle this would be to have a handler a controller in that does the image lookup based on id and returns the image coupled with caching this could be very efficient and would allow you to do image replacement as

think it might differ if you are working on an internal software vs a external software internal software it will almost never be a problem to use a formally defined however for a product the version or release number is in most cases a commercial decision that does not reflect any technical or functional our company the in an numbering scheme is determined by the marketing boys and the z and the internal build number are determined by the department and track back into our revision control system and are related to the sprint in which it was produced is the scrum term for an addition formally defining some level of compatability between versions and releases could cause you to very rapidly move up or to hardly move at this might not reflect added

think most people are missing the point of it looks to me like asking about what inheritance is asking about subclasses implementing functionality that is not a natural fit for a base and the resulting mess that can the pushing of specific methods functionality up the hierarchy or requiring that subclasses implement a contract for functionality that a natural is also the matter of whether it is valuable to be able to treat a base class like the subclass in every case avoid casting and use them this is called the liskov substitution principle for reminding

think my question is best described as an say i have a simple model called and it has a few attributes that are simple data something the db table will contain three columns with those three attributes and i can access them with something like or the problem trying to solve is what happens when or can no longer be contained in a simple data assume that foo and goo represent the same type of that they are both instances of just with different so now thing might look like now there is a new model called that looks like far this is all now here is where if i have how can i set it up to refer to my 2 instances of whazit by name the the is that any thing will always have exactly 2 that i need to know if the whazit i have is basically foo or i do in the current but that is initial thought is to add a attribute to whazit so i can get the whatzits associated with my and then choose the whazit i want by name that that seems ugly there a better practices for multiple associations with the same class in

think really enough information to work with but my best guess is that the product control is not getting data you may try calling from the search control something inside the product control that cause a for instance other thing you might try is removing the updatepanels and seeing if things then add them back in once you get core functionality gone ahead and put some example code that works here which i believe accomplishes what you what follows are snippets for the sake of saving but include all code necessary to make it hopefully this will at least give you something for to setting it to false will force the natural postbacks and is good for debugging updatepanel sure you are seeing come up on your too fast depending on your dev register register public string prodcutcontrolid protected void eventargs product c as if at values void int if out i does not represent best just a simple

think setting the directly is treated by the browser the same as it would treat the user directly entering a new url into the location this means that no referrer since referrers are about one page directly referring to via a not the browser just going to another way i can see to solve your issue is to make sure your drop down list is in a form that posts to then make your javascript submit the form like then just need to change your setdefault action in your controller to have a playercharacters parameter so that the mvc will bind the request value to your method

think that i can explain this there is a better explanation somewhere in one of either or but i feel like i believe what you are seeing is a consequence of how virtual functions are implemented and the pay for it until you use nature of there are no virtual methods in then a pointer to the object points to the as soon as a virtual method is the compiler inserts a virtual lookup table and the pointer points to this probably missing something my brain working since i could not get this to occur until i inserted a data member in the base if the base class has a data member and the first child class has a then the offsets differ by the size of the vtable on my an example that shows this t this a char void a virtual void virtual void b virtual void a b c return this on my machine prints the this this this this this this this interesting thing is that both and exhibit the address change as between calling methods on and or the difference is that contains a virtual this allows the compiler to insert the additional table necessary to implement function the other interesting thing that this program shows is that and is different in when it is called you can also see a size increase using as soon as the virtual table is your as soon as you made the vtable is inserted and it actually pays attention to real type of the object as well as inserting the bookkeeping structures this causes the offset to the base of the object to i really wish that i could find the reference that describes a mythical memory layout and why the address of an object is dependent on the type that it is being interpreted as when inheritance is mixed into the you have heard this classes always have virtual this will help eliminate little surprises like

think that our method can be called best but it has served us have several large databases for our application so maintaining local copies on each developers computer has never really been an and even though we develop against the live we do need to do the development against a database that is as close to the real thing as a consequence we use a central web server as and keep a development branch of our subversion trunk on generally we work on the same part of the system at but when we do need to do or someone is making a lot of substantial we branch the trunk and create a new vhost on the dev also have a checkout of the code on the production so after finished testing we simply do a svn update on the production implemented a script that executes the update command on all servers using this is extremely since our code base is large and takes a lot of time to subversion will only copy the files that actually have been so a lot has worked really well for and the only thing to watch out for is making changes on the production servers directly of course is a from the since it might cause conflicts when

think that the most important letter in mvc is v for working with ajax with and js is part of presentation layer so by theory it is place for view is responsible for what you send to end and mvc patter is there not only to separate view and controller but to enable us multiple views for the same data model it is best to encapsulate code in a class and use that same controller code to render different in first case that could be drawing of a static but in other scenario it is view specially designed for ajax calls and data may be in json or other standard format it as long as you respect responsibilities that every layer

think that this should be done when you build your projects for simply enclose all code that needs to disappear between a that checks for a defined compiler if then the code between the if and endif will not this works for code files anything other that you need to take just make up your own depending on the file as jon skeet but once you put that into build you need not care about it any more no switching	
think that web design and web development are separate the topics that you are listing cover design color and color reproduction image design page composition and code html information usability and usability ria tools development http runtime and deployment performance and database list is but in web design is about the presentation and structuring of web deveopment is	
think that you are wrong on this you can have multiple zend framework application on the same been using multiple installation on my server in order to try out zend have fixed file structure as far as i know of the reason of my choice of can place even place zend library outside the webroot folder and call it with something like include load new	
think that you do not need the extra quotes around the question char from tasks where completed it should

think the best option for this would be to use a user in which you could map the enum in your class to those two is an example of using icompositeusermap which can be used as a object and nhibernate in your just implementing iusertype could	
think the best way would be to use a flag updatingcheckbox updatingcheckbox updatingcheckbox object eventargs e if posting only the code is not really this the event handler perform its normal operations when the checkbox is changed through	
think the big issue here is that creating an inner class of the surrounding the list you create will have an implicit reference to the outer normally a if you serialise this object thinking particularly of using since run into this then the serialised form will contain the serialised outer which at all what normally expect and can result in peculiar use the above initialisation pattern a so long as aware of the inner class mechanism then not a i think the equality issue is an issue beyond that of equality implementations on derivations in	
think the biggest benefits of moving to 2008 will be the new features in the runtime for has not really changed a whole lot since you may need to push out upgrades to all the but not too bad tell people to update their runtime using windows programmers will thank there are some great new features in	
think the first method is there is no guarantee when it comes to method execution and if the methods do come in a sequential the first method makes more sense when multiple event handlers are attached to an it becomes very easy to miss out other events when detaching individual event	
think the general consensus on the current windows workflow is that the product is not quite ready for primetime if you want to get anything more than trivial accomplished with the current you will likely have to write a few custom tasks to fill in functionality also had issues with the designer flaking out when the complexity of the workflow starts piling what been about windows the next version is a complete rewrite that fixes a lot of the issues in the current they claim backward compatibility with but you probably will have to know the framework pretty well to know what changed and how to fix it if it work right you have a project that absolutely demands this functionality probably better off waiting until the new bits	
think the inserted trigger is just add to the inserted column as a default value instead of	
think the issue here is that the string as seen by the user this is a test new the code sees it this is a test new much simpler solution would be the replaces with be confused by the regex match the has to be escaped in the match but not the	
think the main issue you have to watch out for is upgrading once you upgrade to a new version of visual you will be forced to upgrade your project files as once the upgrade is complete the file will no longer be compatible with previous versions of visual this means that you will break anyone who is using the previous version of vs to the best advise is to upgrade the entire best way to work around this is to keep 2 versions of the project file one for the previous version of visual studio and the other for the this obviously has a bit of and once you actually start using new language features this will no longer be a sufficient as the new features likely compile in the old versions of visual	
think the only way to do this would be to generate a dynamic sql the other option would be to take all column values as default them to and check for or is and or is

think the problem is in your expectations of extracted try using this in your current python	
think the problem might be that cannot implicitly cast an int to a it looks like your mapping maps this field to an int16 the you are passing in is allocated as an int by know why it would have trouble comparing an int to a short think there is a literal suffix for you might be able to do	
think the proper metaphor is related to the way is used with electrical in a is generally an entity responsible for the final reception and cleanup of whatever it is it is means the in this continue to be used in the system after reaching the the end of the think is but reading down the list of is illustrative	
think the reason for the is to allow visual studio to put all the declarations in a separate so that they clutter up the in addition to the also a which contains all the control a look at for a bit more	
think the ruby class libs can do pretty much anything the java libs can so not much of a compelling reason to use jruby on rails in a use it to integrate with a vendor java knocking up a quick controller and some views is much easier than extending using in a a rails developer may be obliged to deploy to tomcat or the warbler gem for jruby enables

think there are plenty of applications still done in mfc and of i think it would be a wise choice to add wpf to your tool should you drop everything and learn it up to i am seeing more demand for not but neither was in the long winded answer is that you just have to take the no one knows if wpf apps will dominate the leaning towards the possibility and also thinking silverlight may be a real player in web apps moving since there are transferrable skills between the hedging my bet a little bit by continuing to learn see also it better to use wpf over not a concrete	
think there are two approaches to meaning of term java it is about syntax and terms of oop i began to completly understand java before 2 days of firstly you will be charmed by impossibility to shoot your own leg if it is case of embeded class system apis and it takes about to feel yourself friendly with i

think this belongs in the database for two middle tiers come and but databases are this year java next year the year after that something the data in my if the database is shared at all it should not have to rely on every application that uses it to know how to maintain its data i would consider this an example of encapsulation of the why force knowledge and maintenance of the history on every	
think this is a problem with you can you please supply have you got more that had an error like this one it quite fit what you are but maybe you left out some if you have an you should not configure the settings in in the although i suppose other things can make this error turn i bet you do have two here	
think this is good advice regarding temp talks about avoiding generating them in favour of getting to the real action the user	
think this query will do what you are looking note that your existing query has a bug in that if more than one case exists it will only check if whatever case happened to be selected by the initial query is closed course that is only true if it is possible to have more than one case assigned to a particular join on and 5 case when is null then as else as end as	
think this regular expression is a little more if your language support negative use this replace it by matching	
think this should do as join items using by column is going to be dodgy each row represents multiple and only showing the from one of you can list all of them with a lot of	
think this will a file in your directory as hostname hostkeyalias checkhostip port user hostname hostkeyalias checkhostip port user below this flag is set will additionally the host ip address in the this allows ssh to detect if host key changed due to dns if the option is set to check will not be default is an alias that should be used instead of the host name when looking up or saving the host key in the host database this option is useful for tunneling connections or for multiple servers running on a single and line avoids you having to give those options on the command so you can just ssh ssh	
think this will help you thwart dos if you sleep the request you are still allowing the request to occupy your thread pool and still allow the attacker to bring your web service to its best bet may be to lock out requests after a specified number of failed attempts based on the attempted login source to try and target the source of the attack without detriment to your valid	
think those are stored in the user part of the local copy of the if they then you can always override them in the user settings within the	
think tserversocket still but by any no other gotchas that i know these components are you might want to look at moving to or in the longer	
think understood your question but you can make use of set datatype and generator schedule only accepts an even number of if 0 while team list from sql select team in keeps sql processing to a minimum and should be very easy to add to new like the ones i understand good makes more sense should have had one less in which definitely recommend take a look through the and look at consuming the teams array as you are grabbing random it would probably be best to feed the home and away teams from the home day into the away so you can ensure there that each team plays home and away each	
think wcf support custom command processing out of box and it will be quite a bit of hoop jumping to get that to i would the wcf service inside a windows service rather than a socket listener inside the windows service listening on the port of your some code to process your command when data arrives the	
think we fixed this in but i do recall a fix in as have you tried using the overload for innerjoin which takes four like using if so you can try as i think we have a fix in place for also innerjoin has some overloads where you can explicitly tell it which tables and columns to join	
think what after is natural sort like windows explorer if so then i wrote a blog entry a while back showing you can achieve this in a few lines of i just checked and using the in the linked entry does return the order you are looking for with the example	
think what done is i would only suggest a few minor one would be to put the cycle call in for i would make accept post this creates a little but you can easily avoid it by defining this helper case when post then your template code will look like	
think what missing is the fact that the methods defined on automatically generated for the delegate type by the you originally delegate void compiler class somedelegate public intptr public virtual iasyncresult asynccallback object public virtual void public virtual void appropriate method attributes you change the signature of somedelegate to remove the the generated type changes class somedelegate public intptr public virtual iasyncresult asynccallback object public virtual void public virtual void nothing really dynamic going on you changed the signature of and that changes the signature of nothing	
think what used in the past was the functions mainly centering around the and increasing a count with the and then the end is a bit tricky because of the session if you are not concerned a lot with how exactly accurate the count is then you can stop not then probably use a combination of the javascript onunload event with some sort of ajax request to invalidate the session and subtract the the event would have to see if the user was actually leaving the page or just going to another page on the start i remember having to do with asp sites so there is definately some information out there on this	
think what you have is just a simple relational where the main relation is the particular data structure here is and you might want to do transitive queries of descendant of which are not usually supported by standard sql if you want to do it in you could us a directed acyclic graph	
think what you need to use is a static static static static from to new to why do it on first i just see the need for that kind of complexity when there are other alternatives that make it clear	
think will be of use to	
think you answered this you could also do a find in all or if strongly typed find all references and then remove ultimately rely on even if they were just some comprehensive smoke	
think you answered your question writing it down problem can be seen in this from one hand you have time you have fresh data and from them nice to create view to show time as time goes there are more data and logic so good to have written down summaries of data you had some time very pragmatic you do not duplicate because you recalculate them and save into new table summary of when you think of it in this obvious that in this example new table will be as you have more complicated archive data unchanged when logic when you meet this of this criteria as you requirement than its not choice you go into i would use view is only when showing fresh data out of other fresh in very simple and when it gets more complicated you always switch to new do not be afraid to go into having one summary table with faster access is very pretty solution and a sign of well formed care of the design of this table so when business logic changes you do not need to change everything from one stone in this and then everything will be	
think you are looking for a approach is well known among the porter stemmer is basically an affix stripping combined with a few substitution rules for those special stemmers deliver stems that are linguistically for both and can result in the stem of is not a real this if using those stems to improve search results in information retrieval comes with support for the porter for also devised a simple programming language for developing called are also stemmers for german available in a c generated from the snowball is also available on the along with a plain text explanation of the the german stemmer in looking for the corresponding stem of a word as you would find it in a along with information on the part of you should google for

think you are looking for which will print out the array as you control the formatting more for if you want cool formatting need to do it	
think you are on the right i usually do in a situation like this is design a simple language that captures my needs and write a ll1 parser for the language has to have syntax in i can either quote or just wrap it in brackets that i can and just pass it through to the output can either have it generate a parse tree and generate say 3 different kinds of code from or i can just have it generate code on the either using a mode variable with 3 or just simultaneously write code to 3 different output more than one way to do if you are afraid of writing parsers some programmers there is lots of help elsewhere on	
think you are trying to solve the wrong sounds like you have a trunk which contains versions of maps which are not yet and when you do a you want to cherry pick which maps to update from all the possible updates on this is the create a branch called creating a new empty and copying each map version needed separate svn cp if that will be you have the current release in the tag it cp the whole with where xxx is the meaningful id for your latest as maps are approved for the next svn cp them to your release i assume you want to use because maps a discrete elements not source the time of the next you can tag you what the latest approved maps are and what was in every if you remember the latest release and you can come up with a time need to know without just looking in the tags you can create a tag which svn cp the latest then blow it away and when you do the next

think you could get around this by using a generic list instead of an going to assume you use generics for one reason or need to tell the compiler what type is contained in the arraylist so it can serialize it since all it knows it that it contains this above your property and it should clear it replace with whatever class is contained in the	
think you could try one of the wysiwig editors ones include you should be able to force it into and they will probably tidy up bad html for you i actually tied this technique myself	
think you have a problem in you want a pointer it should be	
think you have it all well modularized code is as flexible as it look at the tons of libs available for the libs that are used a lot a cleanly they solve one problem and they solve it gives the developer using those the to decide what he needs and pick the libs necessary to do the single lib is in the sense that you can use it in many different big blob of mud sorry if statements not at it is hard wired to all the stuff it you want to use it in a different do that without changing the you are really seeing considering the implementation and architecture of code as flexible in the sense of can change it at no matter if he knows anything about results in ugly which soon is so rigid and that you only can throw it a and it even go down the because it is so

think you have to define a separate resource for usage with the when you declare an image resource it is basically creating object of type after that you make it a child of the menuitem and the button by setting icon and content therefore it is not a tree this is not you try to declare the second button that also uses get an exception of logical know how menuitem escaped that may be it is smart enough to remove the image element from children is how it before it adds the image to own logical children i just found a simpler you could add to the image declaraiton in the this will ensure that a new instance of that image is created and it would not break wpf tree

think you need to rethink how preparing and returning your you write to the response write to the and then change your aside the question of why your solution has to change the return i would write to some dummy container object with the return date and make this only once your servlet has completed all its work would you then write this object to the i think servlet filters are the right approach for they will intercept the and the but the response population is the responsibility of the

think you should add a wrapperfactory to your and provide the actual factory implementation in the something class public t a t the wrapped item class implements private private public public boolean return basic problem is that erasure let you know anything about t in the actual so unless you pass something to your list that knows about the specific t you are using how to wrap you be able to do and not designing you in a corner simply a common limitation of java

think your best option is an update checking mechanism that will alert the administrator when there are you there are a number of potential security due to those i would suggest not doing try creating a fairly smart upgrading	
think your solution is just except that you need to use instead of in thread 1 with it actually wait for you cannot use a mutex for because it needs to be released by the same thread that locked but a semaphore based lock would using a monitor would be just more deadlocks are impossible if the initialization part of offlineworker the code before it releases the wait if there are actual deadlocks with your any other solution that makes thread 1 wait for thread 2 would have them too can imagine such after if you pass messages to thread 1 while it is waiting for the initialization of thread 2 to you have a possibility of particularly if there is some bounded buffer for messages or if the message passing function waits for in this i would suggest just abandoning the idea of waiting for thread 2 and maybe pass some callback that would be called from thread 2 when initialization	
thinking about developing a to simplify running distributed in cloud environment of currently by the time of the most is completely unsuited for simple running of distributed queries in the cloud for me is something like where you can write a results from c in where select new key result have it executed remotely over multiple machines in the no storages or configurations to bother papers or open source projects could you advise to check for additional information on the subject scheduling and dag been digging around hadoop by amazon elastic map dryadlinq so obviously this includes for running distributed computations in	
thinking that maybe being added twice and only removed would that is is there any way i can see the handlers in the do not think that is if you do not know the number of times the event handler was taking them off is not a straight forward i presume you can use reflection to achieve would instead recommend you study the code and understand and you have multiple event so that you can manually remove them if need might want to note suggested by that onrowleave is a method of the datagridview and is not an this method is not exposed to the user but instead is responsible for raising the rowleave event which the user can i am not quite sure why you use the term

this failing on the source portion of the data can you post the meta data relating to the i found occassionally with flat files ssis does not estimate the sizes or data types correctly on the flat file when this a data flow task will fail on the source portion of the import as soon as it encounters data that exceeds the length the flat file connection expected in the this failing on the destination portion of the data if does it at least work if you use a as the destination instead of the actual target guessing your problem is earlier in the but if it is making it past the source portion of the data then you may be able to at least isolate the problem as a destination let us know where it is actually breaking in the data	
this fails the constraint it basically doubles the space i very much doubt that a solution which do that without wrecking the runtime complexity somewhere making note that this change the of the space if got a stack with space this will still be just with a different constant a stack of of all values lower in the when you pop the main pop the min stack when you push the main push either the new element or the current whichever is is then implemented as just using your stack min top popping twice you stack min let me know if this enough simple when you grok but it might take a bit of at first downside of course is that it doubles the space execution time suffer significantly though still the same a variation which is slightly more but has better space in we still have the min but we only pop from it when the value we pop from the main stack is equal to the one on the min we only to the min stack when the value being pushed onto the main stack is less than to the current min this allows duplicate min is still just a peek for taking the original version and pushing 1 stack min top from the above pops from both stacks because 1 stack min top again pops from the main because 5 stack min again pops both stacks because 1 stack min ends up with the same worst case space complexity the original but much better space usage if we rarely get a minimum or an implementation of evil i tested it but i okay class private readonly stack new could pass this in to the private readonly comparer private t public t get return public void if 0 currentmin public t t ret if currentmin return

this i would go for a member rule i follow is that if a function has to access something that is internal of the current state of the then it should be part of the of the this the connectedness of a and b depends on the state of your object you could end up having a class having too many in this the keep it simple factor kicks in and you should consider if your class is trying to do too it would then be convenient to have a separated class in your a whose specific role is to hold algorithms that can traverse and act on your maze

this one is really using for my backend and flex for my front also using to manage my remoteobject the user first opens up my flex app i make a call back to and save a few settings in a session variable so that all subsequent requests to can just pull these values out of the session and thus i have to pass them every now on the side i have a model that i stored these values in and then i have the model save itself to the so any class can get a static reference to the model whenever it needs it and that reference will load the values out of the i just have one user using the app everything works if i have two users using the app simultaneously we start to run into user a will start to pick up the settings for user how is this even i thought sessions were supposed to unique to the anyone could offer some assistance on this one that would be remoteobject session

this question is certainly going to open up to some interesting in reply i quote the oft used small companies this might just be simply a matter of being the developers are also likely to be the most technically so it makes sense for them to adminster their own a fan of the which can be used when necessary noticed this approach was very similar in principal to uac later you are developing desktop software not a bad idea for developers to work within the confines that their end will experience limited or restricted if you build the software under limited a good chance that hit the same problems your target users would face given the same set of said if you have a good testing lab a decent qa team this might be a moot point especially if you have a half decent alm finally i develop without mainly because i trust myself and my in a team put it to a in larger organizations you might not have this the enterprise admins often have the final say

time taken to do a square root is much greater than the time taken to do an if you have been taught to avoid conditionals because they are then you have been they are a good deal slower than trivial operations like adding or subtracting integers or bit shifting which is why unrolling loops can be of benefit only if you are doing such trivial but in the grand scheme of things conditionals are good and not bad and to do something as complicated as call a function or calculate a square root to avoid a conditional statement is instead of x why not do 0 maybe the compiler will optimize them the but the second one simpler

two things at play important to point out that sql necessarily work very for a specific use out of the it is a professional product designed to be tuned by a person who knows what access is designed to work very well for most use cases without any the downside of this is covered in the second server is designed for notice how access severely degrades with only it would probably drop very steeply below line before a by sql server holds almost perfectly with the variation stabilizing after about records and will continue to hold at many i think there also may be something else at play here not i thought your sql numbers looked so i ran a test of my on my desktop running windows vista ghz and 2gb of inserts with sequential guid on sql server of 1382 inserts per second at 0 of 1426 inserts per second at 500k inserts per second from 0 to 500k with an average floor of 992 and an average ceiling of 1989 accounting for the normal variance incurred by running this on an say sql server inserts basically scale linearly from 0 records to half a on a tuned server expect even more consistency to mention better inserts per

type inference used by thus i presume other is very precise the compiler will only allow the statement if the type is clear and the outcome is not really a loss in precision it is merely that saving the developer from stating the type more than reducing duplication in the it is important to realize that the result is strongly the compiler at exactly what type the variable there is like a variant if you type x it simply figures out that x is an int because you put an int on the thus saving you some typing and only reason future maintenance programmers might not understand it is if they simply understand the language feature of type inference in the first but i think it is more sound to expect and require that maintenance programmers know the language than it is to avoid good language features out of fear that future programmers know guess if in a situation where you that future programmers are junior and not very knowledgeable about the then maybe you would avoid some but that makes me wonder if you should consider some other or even a like access which is a hybrid of and something that a can do some things

ui is time consuming and because it involves not just visual or sound but more importantly interaction a good api is always interaction model meaning it puts minimal constraints on actual localisation and info the main driver behind this is encapsulation and code a result it is impossible to extract enough information from api alone to construct a good user interface tailored to a specific case of api there are ui generators that normally produce screens based on a given needless to say that such generated are not very for frequent users with demands for higher ui nor are they particularly easy to learn in case of a larger system since they really communicate system image or interaction sequence takes a lot of effort to create a good ui because it needs to be designed according to specific user needs and not because of some mundane conversion task that can be fully speed the process of building ui up and mitigate risks it is possible to suggest either involving ui professionals or learning more about the job there is no shortcut or magic so to speak that will produce a quality ui based entirely and only on an api without lots of additional info and also see an excellent is good ui design so hard for some that has some very insightful and valuable plug for own by karl

understanding is that a blocking send need not be see for example the solaris solaris 11 man pages section networking library man socket types such as and that require atomic error emsgsize is returned and the message is not transmitted when it long to pass atomically through the underlying the do not apply to also look at the eintr error code operation was interrupted by delivery of a signal before any data buffered to be indicates that send can be interrupted after some data has been buffered to be sent but in that case send would return the number of bytes that have already been buffered to be sent of an eintr error practice i would only expect to see this behaviour for large messages can not be handled atomically by the operating on

unit expectation is it the code it should not scan the buffer for data the code should create a byte buffer explicitly on stack or on heap and fill it with the extracts from each the extracts can be obtained in way by using the right shift operation against the integer values and casting the result by the byte type such as your snippet writes past you could fix that by changing the result is technically because the alignment of members in the structures is

us say for a moment that allowed multiple return values in the most pure where we would expect to see something sender receiver receiver that i do not have to understand the return values of the method until i actually make the method perhaps i rely on intellisense to tell me what return dealing or perhaps searching for a method that returns what i want from a class i am unfamiliar we have something like in sender the argument to getparticipants is an string this is a bit different than the above because it means i have to preempt or at least go back and code that creates a variable to hold the result of the out this is a little question is there any syntactic sugar in current that allows a developer to make this declaration in the same line as the method i think it would make development a bit more and also make the code more readable if i were doing something sender string show that receiver was being declared and assigned on the syntactic sugar for out

use of regions tends to border on a religious but i tend are with the use of them although i do wish they were more of a comment directive to start a as opposed to a preprocessor terms of my use of of long in if i have some really long string hard coded in the source code a query that being made into a then i will use a region around it so i can get it out of the way of other more relevant of long blocks of private fairly self although automatic creation via properties in is minimizing the need for of long blocks of class this one should be self explanatory and it more to help me scroll through a file quickly than anything granted i could just search for what i am looking but when looking at a file i sometimes want to read through the entire file but looking at a bunch of property declarations add any value and wastes my of blocks of constant this last one should also be be fairly self and grouping of required reimplementation similar to what was mentioned by if i need to implement some code for use of another class i might throw a region around it as it should never really need to be changed or be that side of those i try to avoid regions for the most part and if i see a region inline with some code then it usually raises a red flag in my

use packed structures that are overlaid directly over the binary packet in memory today and i am rueing the day that i decided to do the only way that we have gotten this to work is defining specific types based on the compilation environment unsigned int the appropriate pragmas in to specify tight packing of structure that everything is in one byte order network or writing both the server and client you are just starting i would advise you to skip the whole mess of trying to represent on the wire with just serialize each primitive element if you choose not to use an existing library like boost serialize or a middleware like then save yourself a lot of headache by writing an abstraction around a binary buffer that hides the details of your serialization aim for an interface bytebuffer void void void void void void each of your classes would have a method to serialize to a or be deserialized from a and this is one of those things that i absolutely wish that i could go back in time and i cannot count the number of times that i have spent time debugging an issue that was caused by forgetting to swap bytes or not packing a other trap to avoid is using a to represent bytes or to an unsigned char buffer to extract if you always use on the then you can use simple code to write the bytes to the buffer and not worry about the remains nicely platform agnostic since the numerical representation is always logically this code also lends itself very nicely to using templates based on the size of the primitive type char not so but very easy to write and

used for two and i needed something that would work on new to wxwidgets and i want to spend lots of time futzing about with building the think it works quite and being familiar with similar gui building tools jigloo for i found it easy to you stick with the paradigm of using wxformbuilder to generate base and then you make a class that inherits to layer your application specific logic on absolutely not the code wxformbuilder then it works well and you can easily update and modify your guis in wxformbuilder again generate your base guis quite in a visual without having to constantly look up the have to do as many cycles just to make sure your gui is looking like what you base class paradigm can make a reasonably clean separation of your gui and business logic only used wxwidgets to create very so really pushed the tool to any the base class paradigm could sometimes get in your way if you are doing something too sophisticated with your gui that could indicate that you may need to your had a situation where i needed a menu item when compiled for one operating but not when compiled for there is no logic in wxformbuilder to support i ended up taking the of always creating the menu item and then having my derived class make it invisible if it was the wrong os about i

used to be in the question would be very useful is a non trivial example of an app which uses events it really helps testing so far use events or publish number of classes can be notified when an event is subscribing classes do not need to know how the metronome code and the metronome does not need to know what they are going to do in response to the publisher and the subscribers are decoupled by the this is highly desirable as it makes for more flexible and robust the metronome can change how it detects time without breaking any of the subscribing the subscribing classes can change how they respond to time changes without breaking the the two classes spin independently of one which makes for code that is easier to static void setup the metronome and make sure the eventhandler delegate is metronome metronome new wires up the method to the eventhandler listener listener new listenerb listenerb new class a so every time tick is the runtime calls another in this case and public event eventhandler virtual so can override default behaviour in inherited classes protected virtual void null guard so if there are no listeners attached it wont throw an if public void while because using eventhandler need to include the sending object and eventargs although we are not using class public new private void eventargs class public new private void eventargs heard article writing on my some of this text is from

using generics to create a key for a say this is definitely not a good idea for a couple different first reason is that it violates the reasoning behind a dictionary a key should hold some significance to the value it why are you storing a string under what does does it mean the string is either true or confusion like this makes the code harder to also suspicious that the key value is used in casting the string somewhere else in this is clearly a of dictionaries and second reason is that the session is shared within a so two completely different segments of code written by two different developers are accessing this shared what is to stop one developer from identifying as an appropriate for data a in their and another using as a for data b in their now the first developer is expecting a when accessing this but gets a unique key would prevent this from

value inside the body of the closure is being bound to the same instance for each closure to the variable which is the loop control variable for the for this value is changing as you go through the you need to figure out a way to make sure that it is bound to a different variable that is unique for each the method shown by apphacker is one although possibly a little funcs i i var index create 3 and store them in each should log its method work the reason being because in javascript uses function scope as opposed to other algol derivatives which use block you can use as a slightly less portable but it looks like your best bet is to use a factory method to create the

various problem there are languages that free you from having to type a lot of stuff necessary to clarify your but every language fails in some and for some not everybody is comfortable expressing their ideas in an object oriented design or as functions and closures as logical derivations there are problems for which it or as declarative statements of the desired result various with varying yet each of these is the right answer in certain and most of them overlap to some few modern languages are all that purely oriented to single some languages favour other things over such as having efficient implementations or being easy to learn python or its scripting

viemu page itself has a pretty good article that might help to answer your oh do those nutheads use spent the last couple months trying to teach myself to use vim and now i can hardly stand using other editors because they seem underpowered and for a random imagine you have a line of code that looks like to shows at the top of a normal how would you change the probably have to reach over and grab your mouse and carefully select or move your cursor inside the first quotation and hold down shift and the until you got to the closing quotation with my cursor anywhere the i type and it erases everything inside the quotation marks and puts me into so i can type the new value i my hands even have to move from my normal typing are so many things like i think you really have to spend a while using the editor to understand how powerful it very slow and hard to use at why a lot of people try it for a short time and think is everything is way but after a while you start thinking in terms of the it all starts to become automatic and much faster than using a as i i go back	
view controller can only be on one navigation and it cannot be in several places on that you really want to save memory by only using one view i would suggest that instead of using a tab bar you just use a tab bar view and set your root view controller as its the root view controller would then directly interpret tab bar events and change its filtering

view structure is based on the not the model in the mvc you should have a view for each action public in a the controller actions have to match up directly to each table in database but there is likely some sort of direct relationship between the number of tables in the database and the number of controllers and controllers are higher level is standard to have crud type actions on the when they are list the items view a specific edit an new delete an of these actions will require a view sometimes more than you can collect a large number of views if it is a large the way to minimize the code shared functionality to partial as to keep the action views as small and simple as the views and controllers simple so that they are easy to ajax to implement more functionality in one important to point out that any large application is going to have lots of whether mvc or web if there is a lot of data to work there are going to be a lot of forms necessary to do

virtual call has to check for being null and a virtual call does so i see in generally why a virtual calls would be in special cases the compiler jit be able to inline the virtual call better then a as a compiler has access to better type the call method instruction be slower in as the jit may be able to use a quicker instruction that only copes with a small offset as it know more about the runtime memory layout and processor model then a we are talking about a handful of processor instruction at most on a modem superscalar it is very possible that the instruct is run at the same time as the and therefore takes no is also very likely that all the processor instructions will already in be the level 1 cache if the call is make in a but the data is less likely to be the cost of reading a data value from main memory these days is the same as running 100s of instructions from the level 1 therefore it is unlucky that in real applications the cost of a virtual call is even measurable in more then a very few fact that the code uses a few more instructions will of course reduce the amount of code that can fit in the the effect of this is impossible to

volatile keyword should not confused as to making and see for a better the manualresetevent does not have any bearing on the of and you have to manage that with this i am attempting to distill all of the information that has been put in various answers and comments regarding this basic question is whether or not the result variables and will be at the time the flag variable returns a assume that none of the variables are marked in this it would be possible for the result variables to be set the flag variable is set in like private void possibly work goes is clearly not what we so how do we deal with these variables are marked then this reordering will be but that is what prompted the original question the volatiles required or does the manualresetevent provide an implicit memory barrier such that reordering does not in which case the volatile keyword is not really i understand position is that the function provides an implicit memory barrier which fixes the that seem sufficient to the main and background threads be executing on two separate if does not also provide an implicit memory then the function could end up being executed like this on one of the processors with the volatile private void possibly work goes have searched high and low for information regarding memory barriers and the and i have come up with the only reference i have seen is the one wekempf has made to jeffrey the problem i have with this is that the eventwaithandle is meant to synchronize not access to i have never seen any example where eventwaithandle is used to synchronize access to as to believe that eventwaithandle does anything with regard to memory i would expect to find reference to this on the this is a response to response to my managed to read the section from jeffrey book at from page 628 quotes this i should point out that whenever a thread calls an interlocked the cpu forces cache so if you are manipulating variables via interlocked you do not have to worry about all of this memory model all thread synchronization locks call interlocked methods it would seem as wekempf pointed that the result variables do require the volatile keyword in the example as shown since the manualresetevent ensures cache closing this there are two additional points like to my initial assumption

want to make sure that simply reading the directory each time and generating the file names is a real bottleneck before do anything more certainly less but the code is arguably if it a then the controller action responsible for rendering the view is the right place for the note that need to turn of output caching for the action it if you want the image to change each it turns out that reading the file names and constructing the links really is a bottleneck it may take much less time than reading the actual file and the files in the directory can change while the application is then constructing a collection of them and storing them in the session on login is a reasonable way to handle the caveat is that if the application is also responsible for uploading the images that it knows when they you might be able to load them at application start and keep them in a global instance which is updated by the application as images are uploaded you have your collection of images reading each from the or a global use a random number generator to pick the image that you want to display or a set that you want to rotate through using something like the jquery cycle pass it to the view and have it render the image

want to rain on your but in my experience trying to get folks for whom programming is not their primary interested in something as relatively arcane as writing good template code in is a sysiphean i work in a department with a large number of very good and even getting the organization to commit to adopt new technology is not always if your folks are good mathematicians and know enough programming to get trying to impose a mandate on them that they need to write generic instead is going to be a very tough try hard to follow advice and try to come up with some sort of generic algorithmic framework that minimizes the raw template coding they need to that might be the best way to overcome the resistance to the inevitable perception that you are simply shoveling more work at

was a really good discussion on this over at last it answers your question pretty are pretty straightforward just remember the and xxx import are executable they when the running program reaches that a module is not in then an import creates the new entry in and then executes the code in the it does return control to the calling module until the execution has a module does exist in then an import simply returns module whether or not it has completed that is the reason cyclic imports may return modules which appear to be partly the executing script runs in a module named the script under its own name will create a new module unrelated that lot together and you get any surprises when

was asked this very question in an interview a couple weeks ago heard whether i got the me it was several assignments in my first programming class after the basic intro it was the first time a course in web design was offered at my since it was several graduating seniors signed up and comprised about half the the instructor was used to teaching and already knew many of those in the basically he taught it at their rather than for the other half of the class who were pretty the most difficult assignment was writing a i had problems with parsing for the various tags and asked for the instructor if had the compilers course you could just write a simple at that point was a black box that did magic things before the program i really know what it much less was i able to write thing that made it difficult was not having the tools necessary to do the to include understanding the results i got when i pages and apis are great if you already understand what you are looking but not for teaching a in my experiences learned the most when i had a mentor who if stuck more than a couple let me know so i can get you unstuck and moving much better than those who want to hear from me except every week or	
was avoiding writing what may seem like another thread on but bear with hopefully like others still am not satisfied or clear on the best approach to take given trends and new emerging technologies when it comes to selecting an architecture to use for enterprise suppose i am seeking mass community opinion on the direction and architectural implementation would chose when building an enterprise application utilising most facets of technology and what direction you would i better make this about me and my in fear of this being too vague i would like to improve my architecture to improve and would really like to hear what you guys think given the list of technologies i am about to and all best practices and architectural patterns you would suggest are welcome and if you have created a solution before for a similar type any pitfalls or caveats you may have hit or is a list of technologies adopted in my latest yep pretty much everything except wpf client by smart to by sql server and additional components to injection management testing currently have this running in an adopting a design pattern utilising sure of formal and the repository most of my structure was adopted from suppose i am more or less happy with most of my tiers really just the dal which i am a bit uneasy i these are the real questions i have faced with my current have a big question mark on if i should have a custom data access layer given the use of linq to should i perform linq to sql directly in my layer or in a dal in a repository should you create a new instance of your db context in each repository method call or one in the class you believe we can truly use poco old clr when using linq to i would love to see some examples as i encountered problems and it would have been particularly handy with the wcf work as i obviously be carrying l2s objects across the an mvc project by itself quite clearly displays the design pattern you should by keeping view logic in the controller calling methods and of course your data access in the but would you drop the facet for larger particularly where the data access is what approach would you take to get your for hearing me out and would love to see sample on architectures and how it is as said i have seen i am yet to really go through oxite but just thought it would benefit myself and additional question in dal bullet design practices for architecture with linq to sql can we truly use design pattern to

was made to make writing a compiler it does a lot of stuff based on that one pointers only exist to make writing a compiler as do header many of the things carried over to are based on compatibility with these features implemented to make compiler writing a good idea when c was c and unix were kind of a c ported unix ran in this c and unix could quickly spread from platform to platform whereas an os based on assembly had to be completely to be concept of specifying an interface in one file and the implementation in another a bad idea at but not what c header files they are simply a way to limit the number of passes a compiler has to make through your source code and allow some limited abstraction of the contract between files so they can header really offer any advantage over another by putting more effort into the you can compile a reference object as easily as a pointer to the exact same object this is what does is a simple it had a very limited feature and you could write a compiler without much porting it is generally not trying to say a bad language or just that primary goals when it was created may leave remnants in the language that are more or less unnecessary but are going to be kept around for seems like some people really believe that c was written to port so first version of unix was in assembler but intention was that it would be in a first tried in 1971 to fortran on the but gave after the first then he wrote very simple language he called which he got going on the but there were because the implementation it was always going to the basic notions of which was based on the just were not right for machine like the used the to add to which for a while was called for and then he started write a compiler for that first phase of c was really these phases in short succession some language changes from adding the type structure without much change in the and the ritchie second phase was he of rewriting unix in started in the summer of 1972 but two figuring out how to the basic that how switch control from one process and the difficulty in the proper data since original version of c did not combination of the things ken to give up over the ritchie the i structures and probably made compiler code somewhat better better code and so over the that was when we made concerted effort and actually did the whole operating system in is a perfect example of what i from the only exist to make writing a compiler pointers exist because the simplest possible abstraction over the idea of adam rosenfield hour are in order to implement pointers are the simplest possible abstraction to in no way are they the simplest possible to comprehend or arrays are much to implement arrays as efficiently as pointers you have to pretty much add a huge pile of code to your is no reason they have designed c without but with code like will take a lot of effort the compilers to factor out the explicit and additions and make it create the same code that this would out that variable after the fact is new compilers can do but back then it just and the os running on that crappy hardware needed little optimizations like few systems need that kind of optimization work on one of the slowest platforms and most of our stuff is in and in the rare case where you might need the new c compilers should be smart enough to make that kind of conversion on its

way is to use this is more efficient than using and then casting each time both the and the cast require prod setting as for when to use and when to use a using really easy	
way of handling this is to load that list of methods at runtime into a and then for each use the that something like this this code is simplified and omits error extends methods method if when you want to call look up the method in the by argument type and use that show this again with simplified but this time full note that to be fully the code gets a little more as is shown if you have to worry about primitives depends on your or if you have to worry about interfaces or then you can simplify the example if you can guarantee that there will be no overlap in interfaces or superclasses in the arguments that you have to worry you can move all of the complicated logic into initialization matter if it takes 1 ms in this all of the logic in would be moved into the where you would loop over all interfaces and superclasses of each method you find and add them to your if you do this then becomes a single without this optimization and with full my example of how to do class test private final parametertypemap new private final tests new new new public methods for method if clazzes if if see private void if else if and so on for the other six primitive types public void for test method method if found for try catch private method method method if return look for x while null x method if return x look for for i method if return return public static void test test new setters public void public void public void public void public void	
way seen to share session state across different applications is to use one of the other options for storing session state unfortunately i have access to iis 7 at the but assuming it is how you configure it in iis management up properties for the applicable virtual tab edit management state defaults to but you can change it for your various application to use the same sql server	
way that springs to my mind is to use a generation number for the give the todo table a column called generation and associate with it a global and persistent generation number best to put this in a table in the time an update or insert is made the generation number is incremented and put into the generation number column for the updated or inserted the records are first read from the db and put on the web page the current generation number is also retrieved and cached locally put into a javascript subsequent ajax driven reads use a where clause which filter only records with a generation number greater than the locally cached generation this ensures only new updates and deletes are the locally cached generation number is then are a bit more one way to do it is to tombstone deleted records for a limited say 21 you have bit column called tombstone and a datetime when a record is deleted the column has generation number set in the same way as for an insert or the tombstone bit is and the datetime is set to the current time using the ajax request can then select records with the tombstone flag set and remove them from the client side if the client is coded so that after every 20 mins a full page or an ajax call that gets each and every is enforced then a db job can run every minute and clean up the tombstoned records older than 20 you actually need to separately persist the generation you can the sql function max over the generation	
way that you should set up your development should be as your normal development in labwindows source use and for your interface to use i have been using tortisesvn with vs2008 and vs2005 for a while and i find that it is just your normal development in vs2005 or vs2008 and link to the measurement studio libraries supplied by national you will have the option of using or whatever your heart you can also integrate other libraries or such as and you would get the added benefit of framing your questions in terms of microsoft technologies vs national instruments where the support is much can integrate subversion with visual studio through a number of addons but i prefer to use 2 is nice because you are able to use the best of all visual studio measurement studio roll your tortisesvn

way the optimistic concurrency in linq2sql works is that it stores the original values and compares them on you throw the datacontext away you loose the original i usually do is to load the object form the database once more when about to then modify that object with the values from the

way to handle this very flexibly is to have a build directory under revision not try and svn your actual home directory has its own inside this you keep a structure the makefile can contain logic for specializing files be heavier than you but if your actual setup is complex done this across 3 or 4 different unices at a then worth doing something like

way to protect your innovative look and feel is to release everything as that if you for whatever reason become unable or unwilling to continue working on or you are no longer the best person to develop then others can take over without needing to compromise with you to obtain protected even from in that it will not suffer for your future did you mean the best way to exploit your innovative look and feel for money if worried that using stacked would be unethical in your own you could maybe email jeff atwood and if he has no problems with then regardless of whether there is in general a case to be made for monopolies on innovative interface this particular case is	
way to share data between different view controller classes is through the app example you could have defined in you app delegate and then access in both of your view controller class as	
way to solve your problem is to use a win32 api called this function to connect to a unc path with not to map a will allow you to connect to a remote even if it is not on the same and even if it has a different username and you have used wnetuseconnection you will be able to access the file via a unc path as if you were on the same the best way is probably through the administrative built in is some sample code that uses for the you should pass null for the lplocalname and the dwtype should be the lpremotename should be

way you are doing it should work although using jquery to populate a div via the function may be a cleaner way to do in order to get your current implementation there could be a few things you want to look assume enablepartialrendering is true on your scriptmanager worth sure the eventtarget for the call is set up as an async trigger for your update panels or that it is inside the updatepanel if you are only using one here for returning false from the javascript code that executes in the onclick event handler if you have attached this to a to make sure the form is not being submitted normally by your browser when you click the

we finally got around to looking at this and we ended up with the a new httphandler that kicks inn for all requests in format the forward the request to the path the real proxy is and cache the result from the built in handler for a set to do the we then need to do is to specify the cacheable paths in our scriptmanagers instead of the real path of the flags it as a bug but it works like a

we have been adding automated tests to our existing java we majority of these tests are integration which may cover a stack of calls post into a servlet validates the request and calls the business business layer does a bunch of stuff via hibernate etc and updates some database servlet generates some runs this through xslt to produce response then verify that the servlet responded with the correct xml and that the correct rows exist in the database development oracle these rows are then also have a few smaller unit tests which check single method tests are all run as part of our nightly seems good because we are checking the boundaries of our servlet on one end and database on the if these then we are free to refactor or mess with anything inbetween and have some confidence that the servlet under test continues to problems are we likely to run into with this see how adding a bunch more unit tests on individual classes would that make it harder to refactor as much more likely we will need to throw away and are the pros and cons of automated unit tests vs automated integration	
we need to know what you already know about the you have a username and an old what else do you do you have an email do you have data regarding the favorite you have a password and working email you need to add two fields to your user table it is a database a date called and a string you have the email when someone requests a password you update the user table as some number of some random string of characters you send an email to the user at that has requested a new password for user account at website if you did request this password follow this that link does not work you can go to and enter the following into the you did not request a password you may ignore this yada coding this script needs a if the var update passed on the the form just asks for the username and email if update is not it asks for email and the id code sent in the you also ask for a new password of verify the new you verify the email and the id code all that the request has not and that the two new passwords if you change the password to the new password and clear the password reset fields from the user also be sure to log the user any login related cookies and redirect the user to the login the field is a password that only works on the password reset potential you could remove from the has request a password reset for an account at this email thus making the username something only the user knows if the email is i start off that way because if someone is attacking the they already know the this added obscurity stops attacks of opportunity in case someone malicious happens to intercept the for your the random it need to be extremely any guid generator or even is where salt is something on the user record like timestamp account was it has to be something the user you need this just to keep your database no more than a week is really necessary but at least 2 days since you never know how long an email delay might since the email could be delayed by ip address is only useful for not for if you want to log do otherwise you need see that covers good	
we worked on the issues of dreamfall and age of we came across a few issues that are worth keeping in some of these we some were solved for and some we worked some we never sure all your tools and all your code supports all the charsets you want to and double check that assumption twice during the course of the project and a couple more times to be sure you use a font that supports all the languages you want to most fonts that claim to be unicode are only unicode in the sense that the characters it has is at the correct it does not mean it has usable characters for all is not only done at as some languages space to separate words comes to make sure your routines handles text without any spaces at plural correctly is tricky in the easy and damned hard in the hard make sure you know enough about the languages be using to be able to write code to handle the plural issue keep in mind that english the other languages are among the easy break sentences and build strings with them to fit a as the variable might be placed elsewhere in the sentence in a different use in mind that for some the value of the placeholder might change how to write the grammar is make sure you have a plan for dealing with make sure you have a way to classify the values you use in the placeholders according to	
web application is not suited at all to be running something at a fixed if there are no requests coming there is no code running in the and if the application is inactive for a while the iis can decide to shut it down completely until the next request comes some applications it at all important that something is run at a specific only that it has been run if that is the case for your application then you could just keep track of when the table was last and for every request check if enough time has passed for the table to be polled you have access to administer the there is a scheduler in sql it can run stored and even start processes if you have permission is very unlikely on a shared you need the code on a specific and you access the server to schedule it or run it as a or use the sql server simply not

well as the issues about being inferior to handling as a string is in itself a very unreliable way of might work better if every browser stuck to the scheme of identifying but they most browsers claim to be regardless of what they and that bit at the start is the only readily parsable part of the the rest is completely so scripts started searching the whole string for characterists substrings like this is a browsers deliberately spoof each including substrings like and in their user agent strings when not those mostly to defeat string browsers allow the entire user agent string to be spoofed under user browser variants for example ie mobile is nothing at all like regular but will still match browsers allow to write extra tokens to the user agent string including arbitrary just one registry change by a rogue can make msie look like matching is just inherently for example a new browser called would match

what its the code in the op is a mess not because it uses but because the values in the tuple are too weakly compare the get upset too if my dev team were passing around ids rather than class instances because an integer can represent that being tuples are extremely useful when you use them exist to group ad hoc values they are certainly better than creating excessive numbers of wrapper alternative to parameters when you need to return more than one value from a tuples in make my eyes many languages like and so on have a concise syntax for defining for in the defines a constructor as list can create an instance of a map val values list values val dict dict equilvalent code in is values new new new new new new var dict new believe there is anything wrong with tuples but syntax is too cumbersome to get the most use out of

what you are describing is not that you probably already have the requirements written in a functional document if you use a requirements tool like doors then you get those 2 for that you have to sell off your requirements to a customer then mapping the requirements to test cases is how do you prove the system does what it is required to do and each requirement is requirements to design sections has always been a mystery too only on very rare occasions does it add value as timing but the mere fact that you can prove the requirements are met by the test cases makes this mapping nothing more than a lot of one can argue that it helps the but imo the overhead costs much more than it saves and most of the mappings at this level end up being very arbirtrary of the 4 sections you the only one that requires an inordinate amount of time to maintain is the mapping to design i know it is easier said than but try to get your company process changed so you required to do the design section if you get it changed at the company then you can change the software development plan for the project to specify that you be performing that particular

with marc and unkown above 6 indexes in the clustered index is way too especially on a table that has only 14 you have more than 3 or if i would say 1 or maybe you may know that the clustered index is the actual table on the disk so when a record is the database engine must sort it and place it in sorted organized place on the non clustered indexes are they are supporting lookup my vldbs are laid out on the disk according to the 1st point your clustered index to 1 or the best field choices are the identity if you have or a date field in which the fields are being added to the or some other field that is a natural sort of how your data is being added to the the point is you are trying to keep that data at the bottom of the table or have it laid out on the disk in the best way that read the records this makes it so that there is no reorganzing going on or that taking one and only one hit to get the data in the right place for the best be sure to put the removed fields into indexes so you lose the lookup i have never put more than 4 fields on my if you have fields that are being update frequently and they are included in your clustered going to reorganize the record on the disk and cause costly the fillfactor on your the larger the fill factor number the more full the data pages and index pages will in relation to how many records you have and how many records your are inserting you will change the fillfactor or of your indexes to allow for the fill space when a record is if you change your clustered index to a sequential data then this matter as much on a clustered rule of thumb fillfactor for high for medium and for high by dropping your fillfactor to will mean that for every 100 records on a 70 records are which will leave free space of 30 records for new or reorganized eats up more but it sure beats having to defrag every night 4 sure the statistics exist on the if you want to sweep the database to create statistics using the then sql server will create all the statistics on all the indexes that the engine has accumulated as requiring leave off the attribute though or add statistics for every that would then not be the using dbcc showcontig to see which indexes are getting fragmented the i go into the details just know that you need to do then based on that change the fillfactor up or down in relation to the changes the indexes are experiencing change and how fast a job schedule that will do online or offline on individual indexes to defrag do dbcc dbreindex on this large of a table without it being during maintenance time cause it will bring the apps down especially on the clustered been test and test this the execution plans to see what and fat pipes exist and adjust the then defrag and rewrite stored procs to get rid of those hot if you see a red object in your execution because there are not statistics on that this step is more of the than the off peak run the update statistics with fullscan to give the query engine as much information about the data distributions as you otherwise do the standard update statistics standard on tables during the weeknights or more often as you see fit with your observerations to make sure the engine has more information about the data distributions to retrieve the data for this is so but extremely only give you here minimal information but will help a some gut feelings and observations that go in to strategies used by these points that will require your time and need to go to enterprise i did though in order to get the features spoken of earlier with but i did especially to have much better capabilities with searching and online defraging and maintenance in enterprise it is much much better and more friendly with standard edition handle doing dbcc indexdefrag with online databases as

worked on medium and large sized projects and i say ever seen risk reviews done less than once per fortnight two in some cases they were performed once per month twice a month would be my key to risk management is to allow enough time to pass before you project this gives a project manager enough time to evaluate whether contingencies and migitation are valid and to allow the team time to decide whether risks are more or less likely and whether risk mitigation techniques have lessened the impact of any recorded also need to allocate enough time for individuals who have been assigned ownership of one or more to evaluate and report back on mitigation in other strength is through routine review but enough time must pass for it to be obviously this the sort of task which should be constrained to a rigid if it becomes you could schedule risk reviews closer together to suit the needs of the project if move to weekly reviews and then scale back during stabilization important thing is not to let the or to stop new i missed another aspect of the how to handle the risk to the team other stakeholders a basic say that you need the ability to record risk items and to weigh them according to probability and estimated and also to be able to assign them to various team members version control is critical you do this will vary depending on the nature of your there are plenty of ways to track the information for example which can be emailed to external a sharepoint list someone a must take ownership of the process so it get might want to avoid email since it has a habit of not being stored or recorded

working on a php web interface that will receive huge some requests will contain images that will have to be resized to some common sizes to speed up their further way to do it is probably to set up some asynchronous queue on the set up a table in a db with a tasks queue that would be populated by php requests and let some other process on the server watch the table and process any waiting how would you do what would be the proper environment for that long running or maybe something lighter would way to offload heavy processing image out of php	
working on a product that may or may not have differing license schema for different in a product would run on but we want the end user to be able to use a sql install benefiting from the price clearly this must also be the case for other so oracle may command a higher price than for instance using entity obviously this hides all the neatness of accessing the core schema and using or whatever it rather not the condition by running a series of sql commands for each and see what comes as this would limit our db but if prepared to do is it possible to get this using ef only returns something like sql server i would assume yet checked need to install an sqlexpress would return something similar it is we have no instance so establish whether that returns text or detect dbschema for

working on near the exact same partitioning is definitely the way to go i would segment by more than year it would give you a greater degree of just set up your partitions and then constrain them by months some other in your need to turn to really get the the additional benefit here is that you can only index the exact tables you really want to pull information if batch importing large amounts of data into this you may get slightly better results a rule vs a trigger and for i find rules easier to but for smaller triggers are much the postgresql manual has a great section on partitioning via

works by fading a solid color rectangle in and out instead of fading the actual this works especially when you wish to control the color to which the component should sometimes you need transparency and thus must use there is a little trick to get fade to work neatly with both device fonts and embedded use a blur filter with no when you set a bitmap filter the player internally creates a bitmap copy of your object to which it then applies the if the blur is set to not so to it will still look good and be able to fade perfectly this breaks the zoom feature of the player though since the text is now

workstations are not members of the domain our sql server is not actually on a domain at all we use ssms or anything to connect to the sql we use runas with then we type in the password and it launches the does not allow you to include the password in the batch got a winforms app which needs a sql and the users have to launch it by running a batch file which has the runas and then it launches the the user accidentally launches the exe it cannot connect to sql on the app and using the option work because the workstation really know about the looking for a way for the application to do the runas functionality internally before it starts anything see this link for a description of how runas thinking going to have to use with to build runas functionality into a	
world is powerfull and full featured i think today obstacles are peoples this to say that using needs to take changes in in the way of thinkng architectures and answer you execution depends on more possible to fully customize the to take advantages of various features deffered future queries executed in a future multiple and last but not session management involves in this execution is based on concepts like and lazy this means that queries are executed against the database just qhen you perform some like accessing to methods of the nhibernate session like another example of deferred execution is with using of where just when you access to certain queries are queries are as i said beforre queries executed in a future ayende speaks well about queries are queries that can be together and executed in one time avoiding multiple roundtrips to the and this could be a very cool this is another chapter to but take in mind that if you manage well your or let nhibernate engine to manage well the sometime not needed to go to the dn to obtain all the tools like nhibernate generates queries for and parametrized queries are managed well with parameters even depending on the underlying db engine and conseguently db dialect you clear that frameworks like most of the use reflection at but needed to mention the multiple reflection optimization are see for example clear that or maybe all the time direct code could be but just in the in the big picture this could involve in more mistakes and about or better usefull to understand what you mean when talk about temp tables and temp in terms as as i support natively temp in the sense of runtime but this could be done because nhibernate permit to create object mapping at so a mechanism of temp data could be implemented using that hope i provided an usefull sorry for my bad	
worry about the commands rather when you find yourself struggling with something try a few quick google and man page searches and see how you can improve what trying to do right then and keep it relevant and you will get more useful	
worry about trying to make the language be worry about using it to solve real problems and make real either make lots of money from using this or once you have lots of others may care how you did or either way you have lots of you make lots of nobody will want to know how you did based on i define successful as people using and people use languages to solve most for thus successful	
would add pion web server to the list of potential web servers to on top of been using it to implement a rest interface and so far i have been very pleased the documentation is a bit bits i have had to program so far have been the transformations from to internal data there are a few downsides to having the web server integrated directly leaks in the system will affect the web libraries in are less than safety in is extra important because of memory	
would advocate the refactoring approach did we get here in the first why the individual methods can throw the exception after doing with myobject and that exception can then be safely since the exception escapes the myobject must be in an unknown safe to ignore the surely it must be the wrong way to communicate that something went wrong in each maybe each method that needs to do some logging on if you use static you can pass a logger to each	
would agree that individual tables is it is more scalable and better for query if in future the users want more columns on a particular lookup then you can add the application will have to create tables and constraints i normally do but then this application is already altering existing tables and adding columns to which i normally do	
would also add c j other book on	
would also recommend since adobe is invested in making sure their flash player works browsers on you be dependent upon the moonlight development community to allow supportability linux and believe moonlight is also a version behind so you could also end up having to support multiple versions to capture the linux

would be best to try and match any character that is not allowed by negating the allowed for if you only wanted to allow through you might do the cannot possibly know of the characters that are but you presumably know the ones that are build a regular expression like the one above that matches only one character that is not in the allowed if you get a know that the string contains an invalid you try to use character class escape codes if them for re look for classes and other special it may allow you to have a shorter expression like this individual	
would be better than you really need a dictionary for each since column names are the same for all and if you want to have it you should use column indexes instead of if you have a column that is a 3rd to get its value from a row id the code would val option is depending on the way you access the data only or random could also use from the memory usage i think the best option would be to use a single dimension array with some slack so after say you would create a new copy the old contents to it and leave 100 empty rows at the but you would have to keep some sort of an index when you delete a so that it is marked as deleted without resizing the	
would be cautious about hiring a hacker because i would be cautious of hiring anybody conducting criminal or i would look towards hiring one for network security because they are familiar with finding holes others normally so their expertise in breaking into systems can be integral in learning how to make those systems other question concerning hackers making better there are so many different types of hackers out there that it would be hard to say whether or not it would make them a better you could argue that hackers can become good programmers because a mind geared towards analysis would translate well into the analytical mind necessary for a good

would be glad to get references to resources and experience on comparison of known jsf myfaces and icefaces in terms of ease to community as it was pointed out the initial question is not accurate there are few jsf implementations sun reference and some jsf component libraries but anyhow my question is about both core jsf and jsf component libraries jsf	
would be harder to back out the haversine then generate your i would the angle generated from the earth core by traveling a line on the surface think it is but it is in radians arc length should be just the component of your divisions vary by so that becomes you would angle east defined as to find the angle in longitude but converting back to actual longitude at that latitude would be more	
would be helpful to switch off between experienced developers fixing bugs and junior developers creating but this sound possible with your to not let people get if someone has an issue and is getting encourage them to get help and get on the right per the above make the experienced developers write test cases for their this makes the bug fixing could always intentionally add bugs and fix

would be the best way to download a file from another domain in a zip way to download a file in	
would be very careful at introducing a code generator in a team like particularly the ones you that this can vary with the the current dal enough for the real requirements of the this is particularly important if you have a real need to introduce paging and other similar if the team have these in place and is already facing odds are they will have a hard time moving i would say this is more a case for an specially something part of the team have any previous knowledge on one of these have those members used them on a successful this is more important than it might specially if you are considering something as broad as which introduces its own consider something easy to and that takes you to an all out you have a clear understanding on how the tool and the way it is going to be used affect the developers time to introduce whichever the avoid having it put a on the as it gets in the middle of knowing what have changed when looking at the source control whichever the tool you the developers should be able to work with it with no if not it will get in the middle on an ongoing will you integrate the generated with the already non generated if this is not you might be talking about a full throw if you are in that introducing a new tool is not likely to solve the team have no test automation in doing changes with no test automation is a lot specially because it is hard not to break we introduced nettiers in a couple of projects sometime ago nice to us we did so at the beginning of the and even then it really got in the granted we had more code but that really mean we had more code that new features started being developed with custom code productivity and quality went up we have never used it again and never missed we use orms and other more focused code gen here and	
would be very worried about the that should especially under the light of questions like switch is bad oop	
would bet the linden labs will soon be supporting more languages than they have already moved to using mono to turn its lsl into it seems like a logical next step to allow other languages that can be compiled and run with mono to be perhaps putting a library or two out to support the built in this is my i think if they did open the languages available up to they will get more adoption and more interesting	
would call it and i would also name the class a larger python project working we have lots of modules defining basically one important classes are named beginning with a capital the modules are named like the class in this leads to imports like the nib import foo import import a bit like emulating the java one class per but with the added that you can allways add another class to a single file if it makes	
would check the code for the error pretty clearly indicates that an instance of nsmutabledata is being used where an nsstring is it would seem that either encodebase64 is somehow returning or else the raw is getting passed to not just break it down and check at each using nslog for this but stepping with a debugger would work fine of nsdata nsstring 64 is a encodes it to best guess is that accidentally passing in the raw nsdata instead of an nsstring but failing the above code should either work correctly or show exactly where things are breaking	
would check what version of reader they are using as many of times hit my head against the wall trying to figure out a pdf issue only to discover the users at the latest version of adobe also seen stuff like this happen when the browser gets the only solution in that case is to uninstall and reinstall adobe make sure that the browsers are setup correctly to not allow tons of people at my job call my all the time that i up a pdf when really their browser cache that is the clearing the cache and setting the browser to not cache anything also fixes the not too sure that the whole not receiving the urlrequest is the problem here and you should expand your search to other	
would choose because it has a more central place in the providing versatility for those that need while also providing familiarity to those who are yet to get stuck into things like	
would choose mvc simply because designed to be testable and that would be the major factor in my are much more difficult to unit test because rooted in several concrete classes that are it at all to these include httprequest and is designed to be testable and api greatly facilitates doing article on the testability of	
would choose the create an outer class and name it if the particular class is used in a public the only argument for not including it outside the class is namespace the inner class is quite frankly annoying in because you must constantly prefix the type name with the name of the as once public the only motivation for donig this is reduction of namespace but if your namespace is so big that the inventorysaveargs class is making it too big you probably need to break up your namespace	
would concur with i wouldnt even bother wasting the time trying to run your site with on your host you should have access to a free mysql or mssql use this write a new page that takes parameters and writes them to your online that way you can set up a relay on your machine that pushes the changes from your local machine to the

would create a clr function for reason for this is that clr code is going to be much better at parsing apart the strings and can pass that information back as a which is what sql server is really good at clr function would return a series of records based on the parsed values the input id would then use a cross apply on each element in your	
would create a factory method which will return an interface a delegate which you can which would be passed the current date and return the date range for you based on the which implementation you return from the factory method would be determined by the value of an enumeration you pass to it which corresponds to	
would create a static integer in action class that gets incremented and assigned as part of each new instance of the for private static int count private string public string get return set public count is each time you create a new it will be incremented and appended to the default you need to fill in the holes when you i would suggest the it would automatically queue up numbers when items are but it would be more costly private static int count private static deletions new private string public string get return private int public if assigned assigned public void if assigned when you delete an need to call on the dictionary private int private public count deletions new public string if return return public void can create a dictionary to look up counters for each just make sure you parse out the index and call whenever you rename or delete a	
would create one source control branch for the common code representing the latest and greatest for each project have your own independent branch of that code where you can make quick fixes where needed or have stability when close to a may want to have a wiki where bugs found in the common code are listed so the other users of the shared code are aware of it and get time to fix it at their would work well for this since it is good at merging changes back to the	
would defeat the object of so you	
would direct you should i use there are several good answers that can tell you when good to use and you can figure out from there if worth it in your	
would discourage you from trying the problem is that in order to make regions guaranteed to be you need a very sophisticated type sure looked at the papers by tofte and talpin and you have an idea of the complexities even if you do get regions working the chances are very hight that your program will require a whose lifetime is the lifetime of the that region at least has to be garbage is why cyclone has regions just getting encourage you to go with garbage modern garbage collectors can be made pretty fast without a lot of the main issue is to allocate from contiguous free space so that allocation is it helps to be targeting amd64 or other machine with spare registers so you can use a hardware register as the allocation are lots of good ideas to one of the easiest to implement is a collector like joel where the idea is you allocate only from completely empty you want to study existing garbage has a fairly sophisticated incremental garbage collector there are no visible pause and the implementation is only 700 it is fast enough to be used in a lot of where performance

would do this by reading the excel file into a datatable object and then using sqlbulkcopy to store the this would be fast and relatively simple to	
would doubt one of the main ideas of a source control is that a repository does not loose any you delete the best you can do is get an older version and overwrite the current one with but the history logs will still show your what kind of ide are you using that does something like	
would download the following agent agent the tool to improve code quality and speed up is not but it is worth the money download create a test is class myobject new private void integrated with will give you an icon next to each test the icon lets you test the method directly in the ide without you having to start the entire be developers would say that test driven development means that you create the test first and the object after i usually begins with creating the adding the mandatory methods to it and then create the a bit faster and probably start to refactor the class when started to build the you create the spend most of the time document each the documentation should motivate why the method what it expects from the and what it if you describe it most likely have to refactor

would expect sql to perform much better assuming that able to use why are you surprised at the database engines are optimized for this sort of	
would favour a third into two but do not by are less they require the user to become aware of two options and figure out what the difference between them and if so to also check the documentation or the code to ensure which is would have one function that takes the one that is called or something like that naming becomes easier with real this violates the responsibilities for rule gives it a long i believe this is preferable when your function really does do two things vector and foo	
would first like to are you creating your own template there are some mature ones around like which should be able to fill your this article by jeff atwood is also good read reinvent the unless you plan on learning more about you want to roll your own solution then that is here are some method relies on having the bbcode extension installed with it is native and does not rely on the regular expression engine this solution will be the can have the bbcode parser convert print as print into the bbcode arguments to learn about passing variables into your can view some more examples on the method are a little bit but are enabled by default on all php to go gumbo for this regular expression should can then use it as successful you can access the content using else match attempt	
would get to grips with a javascript library like as it will take care of all the issues for and has such useful methods as to show and hide jquery code would be something if you wanted to hide previously shown submenus you would use

would have a private int field for the nhibernate persistence and a public property for the flag enum that read and write to the int can be configured to work with private way you have to resort to voodoo magic or messy constants to get the job	
would have expected this with because of the boxing with the value but areequal should not have this you add which language assuming your using and which testing does result	
would have expected to equal not entirely unlike expecting 1 1 multiplying by before taking the 12 bit precision floating point and truncation with your extended during truncated to 12 extended during r1 truncated to 12 extended during truncated to 12 extended during r3 truncated to 12 changing the order of causes the the error to and r4 if you add and in this the last bit so in not lost on if you add to the last bit of is lost and so the result is not the one the rounding removes a trailing the other the rounding removes a trailing both does not equal so the errors are not the have many more bits of and probably uses rounding rather than but hopefully this simple model shows you different errors can happen with different orderings of the same difference between fp and maths is that is shorthand for then rather than just

would have to disagree with those are in favor of in a design test we did for a fairly website 1mil uniques at the we found that tabs have not been tabs were clearly located to the right of the main content based on that experience i would suggest either finding an alternative as staticscan suggested run usability tests to figure out which ones

would make it a static member of the reason is that making it public static is saying something about the not only that type knows how to do this but also is the responsibility of this type to perform this and odds are the behavior no longer has any real relationship with the larger mean i make it static at ask yourself could the new method logically belong if you can answer to you probably do want to make it static move it as even if not you could still make it just mark it a matter of you could at least mark it this typically avoids needing to move the method if you have easy access to a more appropriate but still leaves it accessible where needed in a way that it show up as part of the public interface to users of your

would need to know more that what the class does and what the parameters but there is a possibility that the class has too many would it be possible to split the class to smaller independent setters does not solve the problem of the class having many it just moves the problem to a different place and does not force the parameters being i try to follow the advice from the clean code book to have no more than 3 parameters per method for constructors i may have more because typically the constructor will be called by my dependency injection framework and not by builder pattern mentioned by mmyers is also a good solution when building complex and there is no way to make them less

would not rely on uid being the proper search attribute for the user entries in many companies will only guarantee the employeeid as being unique within the ldap	
would not use selenium for this type of test and suggest that you solve a variety of testing issues with different what we do unit tests to test methods and tests to test how application components hang simple functional test framework like canoo webtest some to assert things like http cache basic page simple redirection and cookie setting tests to ensure validity of pages to w3c to test javascript classes and methods we created to test ui and the integration of those worth spending time breaking out the responsibility of testing different aspects of the system using these different tools since using only selenium can cause bigger the the slower they indeed selenium is inherently slower compared to the other tools handles testing well but nevertheless xpaths can be brittle and may require increasing amounts of time and effort to requires you setup data with your app to step through user scenarios can be messy and take a lot of are also some techniques which you may or may not have come across which you can use to make your selenium tests

would prefer the i adding something in the url creates the however that collide with a query string parameter that an app wants to a custom header would be third option could be to have ssl connections redirect to a different say so on the back end you know that port 80 connections were http to begin and port 8080 connections were 443 to begin even though both http at that	
would prefer to create my interfaces interface builder is easier and you write a typo by drag and and you get those aqua guides when typing rectangles by fight interface builder is your let it help you on wasting your own time and energy by writing your ui in like create a subclass of instantiate and make it the and in the create a populate it with and order it quicktime in the method in your subclass of create your windows populate them with and create window controllers for making sure to send yourself for each window	
would presume that when one property changes it is indicating that it may have had an effect on another thereby resulting in that property firing an update as quite property change events fire for an object even when it changed because the developer want to actually check for a and so just fires the event in scenarios where it might have my gut instinct suggests this may be what you are it could also be that whatever is listening the the propertychanged event is not actually checking the name of the property that has this would also cause the same	
would probably be best to drop would you insist on it you have to build a concatenating it is quite a lot of see for	
would probably be better to add each number to a implementation rather than an sets are specifically for storing collections of elements where you want to filter out the	
would probably be better to build a dynamic query in your code with all the joins you customized to each individual parameterized for security of would use much of the same cascading logic you have now but you move it to to the code instead of the then you only submit the exact query you performance would beat using all of the temp tables and you might get some caching benefit after a few queries were	
would probably just format the packet in xml and then on the receive side use linq to xml to pull it you could also use json for the format but that might be slightly harder to	
would probably write some sort of command line tool or service that does the processing and extraction of project then i would use a page to projects that the web server and the command line tool both have common access then at specified times either manually or via cron or similar mechanisms extract the data to your once you have you just use the website to display last extraction times and the extracted the users are on a different subnet then you will need the end users to run the tool and then have it post the data into the	
would quite like the system to be quite easy to define new already have such a it is your in check constraints serve to prevent invalid data from being entered at a case like your example where you want to allow the value but flag it write a and have a client application issue an error if the view has any an view as select from table where 50 the raise an error from return you established a convention that all such views were named with a your client could select all such view names from the systables for the database in one then iterate that list by calling from logging an error for any that returned more than zero this would be adding a new error report would consist of nothing more than creating a view with the proper name not have to recompile the additional advantage is that adding any rule engine would require learning its domain specific language for writing training new staff on and even then inevitably there would be corner cases the rules easily your coders already know and based on a 17 year old ansi standard based on 20 earler years of so most of the corner cases have been ironed out of the	
would recommend an object oriented approach that does not requires modules outside the core distribution and will work	
would recommend cross has support for many and has very intuitive naming of just noticed that nobody mentioned also cross multi lingual	
would recommend implementing this as a with string keys mapping to custom flashitem the flashitem will simply contain the object or string storing plus a boolean possibly called which should be set to true when you insert a new item into the each page load you then iterate the set any isnew true items to and delete any items where isnew is already that should give you a to flash	
would recommend just going with asp is so old a technology that they will have to learn so many work arounds to things that are common would also go with straight over mvc as the jury is still out me on how valuable mvc really it takes a lot of control away from the	
would recommend looking at scheduling you could use the budget to determine a number of times period and use that as a weighting factor in a round robin this would be a simple way to balance out requests from different advertisers evenly through the link above is more geared towards network packet but the basic algorithm would	
would recommend not lightweight but very good	
would recommend queuing the which is then sent via a separate process a service or a worker its a bit more effort to implement but pays off in the long servers can go or be so forcing the user to wait may give them a bad experience with your for sending a signup verification you might also need to send additional email later if they verified for some say 1 this becomes easier with the infrastructure supporting a queued	
would recommend rethinking this first stopwatch just does what it says it acts like a if you want an event to fire at specific want to look at the various timer being i would recommend sharing your timers across the you will find that everything performs much and is probably simpler to write and comprehend if you have fewer timers which are used by a single scheduler you and the scheduler manages the	
would recommend they have milestones and and you can log time and change ticket status from commit	
would recommend using a hosted service for email you may find just the right software for the the main issue is a mailing service increases the chances of your mail reaching the it also provides very useful reports of how many opened and who clicked the price of those services is very much using and happy with their they have an easy to use so you can control your campaigns invoking it from java and in the process of packing my code to post it	
would recommend using the	
would recommend you to use to add event handlers on your here is a onclick code will attach the function to the event for all elements of type when the dom is technique may interest would like to mention that microsoft supports and they will make support for it in upcoming versions of visual for more information please visit	
would recommend you try that with a trivial client maybe even a console the idea would be to see if you can get application to work with the

would say that creating a singleton is actually the only viable assuming that code inside this is known to use static it is absolutely unsafe to create two instances of this results are unpredictable	
would say that for normal tdd works extremely there are cases where you may not need to write the tests first even at but those are you need to do some exploration to see what will i would consider this to be a and i necessarily think that tdd is absolutely necessary in this i would probably not use the actual code in my after it was just an exploration and now that i have a better idea of how it ought to i can probably write better code than my if i did decide to use my probably go back and write tests for if you find that violated tdd and written some production code before your tests it happens go back and write the in on the occasions where this has happened to me often found things that neglected once i start writing the tests because more tests come to mind that handled by the you get back in the tdd rythym vow never to do that	
would say that if you can you can then use it to multiply and divide using should i assume overflows will be simply seem to recall a method of adding variables using i am looking for that answer this will point you in the right if i can find that xor i will post it for it disjunction is often used for bitwise xor 1 xor 0 xor 1001 0111 is equivalent to addition without the reference	
would say that it depends on the in a blog entry or text i would focus on the code to perform or demonstrate the desired i would probably give the obligatory nod to error even put in a check but stub the code with an in you can introduce a lot of confusion by including too much code that focus directly on the subject at in in shorter answers seem to be preferred so handling errors with wave of the may be more appropriate in this context as if i made a code sample available for i would generally make it as complete as possible and include reasonable error the idea here is that for learning the person can always go back to the and use that to help understand the code as actually my personal this is one of the issues that i have with how tdd is typically presented usually you only see the tests developed to check that the code succeeds in the main path of i would like to see more tdd tutorials include developing tests for alternate this aspect of i is the hardest to get a handle on since it requires you to not of what should but of all the things that could go	
would say the recursion version is better but only with scope search local item in return also search return is far easier to explain this try to write a nice comment on the loop version and you will	
would say use prefixes or suffixes for the names very close to hungarian which is widely regarded as even by the creators of it at the sole exception to this rule is which many regard as ok to prefix with but i am of the opinion that interfaces have a prefix you should group classes that are related into namespaces to prevent	
would seriously consider the use of particularly and easy to and in my experience provides the highest level of time resolution an operating system possibly also very it provides some very nice io use it to calculate the difference in program execution probably it would look something like this not execution goes here duration	
would ship the database with the admin user in there by and force that password to get changed on the first is helpful in two you know that the default admin will always be you have to maintain that user creation code that will only run at very random you could make your default password be more	
would simply retrieve the object again on the other view but why not cache the object when it is first as dim members pseudo code a man return as dim members for each member in member data regarding the return should also consider caching the results of the query for a specified time or make it dependent on an you could also use the session object if it is user specific

would store all the information i gather while offline in a sqlite on user you can sync all the stored information with a server using http or a custom protocol you can come up have been using this approach on palm os applications for almost 10 years and they do work very far as i the only you will have to accomplish this is plain old with cocoa although you could use some libraries that will make your life easier if you decide to implement your own santa

would suggest iptables for this put a rule in the iptables that wherever the destination port is the port number of your apache machine and the source ip is the ip address of critix the linux machine should drop that this way would solve your problem provided there are no other applications hosted on the apache of your machine which ought to be open for all an example of the perspective rule could be input 1 should solve your once you replace by its proper

would suggest looking into if you designed for versioning configuration files in using a version control is a collection of tools let be stored in a or bzr it hooks into apt other managers including yum and to automatically commit changes to during package tracks file metadata that control systems do not but that is important such as the permissions quite modular while also being to use if you understand the basics working with revision designed for i think it would probably also work well with some for home directories since the basic needs are the	
would suggest starting by migrating to first step would be to slowly refactor to move all the collections to generic this will help and ease the migration into the especially with it should also have a nice impact on your since any collections of value types will perform wary in this of converting hashtables to since the behavior is different in some but etc are useful moving helpers to static and potentially extension would be a good next step to this can make the code more

would think there would be some way to programatically detect if the object being acted on is a thus you could wrap your custom tbo logic in an if check for and if it is a template none of your logic would be general not considered good practice to have heavy amounts of logic in your as run regardless of context and you often run into situations such as which you want to it is better to put this type of logic in an sbo and call the sbo from the context where you want this logic to be ie by extending

would use eclipse rcp when you really need a platform to built on not just like swing or rcp is rock solid and modular and very once you master you get huge being a platform it give you the most commonly used things automatic layout branding and things like you build a not an but learning curve is pretty steep in the on the other hand is not a you will the wheel by writing your own things i mentioned but swing is faster to learn and get i think it fits better for smaller applications with shorter life

wrote a blog post which has a sample project that you can download here code basically uses aes for encryption of binary data and then rsa encrypts the key and the iv using an as long as the private key certificate is the key and iv can be and then in turn the aes encrypted data can be decrypted could set up your certificate stores so that the only has access to the public key while the has access to the private allows you to encrypt using different key and iv each time and avoid hardcoding which i believe is more there should be nothing in your source code that would easily allow someone to decrypt your data and if your system was ever you would only need to swap out the certificates with new no need to recompile the application with new hardcoded sample code may be slightly different from your intended but i think the technique and some of the code might be useful to

years ago i worked on a web site that grew in popularity beyond our initial expectations and it got us in trouble since we were all relatively inexperienced in web based projects it posed a significant strain on us about what to do beyond usual database separation onto separate load balancing day thought of something pretty since site was based on their profiles were stored in a database table the usual way someone would do it user lots of info variables and stuff like that which would show up as a users profile page which other users could look flushed all that data into a simple html already prepared as a users profile page and got a significant boost basically a i even made a system that when user edited their profile it would parse original html put it up for and then flush out html back to the file system got even more made something simillar with messages users sent to each basically wherever i could make a system bypass a database avoiding a insert or i got a significant it may sound like a common but it was an enlightening it is not an avoidance of relational setup per but it is an avoidance of the database altogether

you be able to return a list of anonymous types unless you cast them to and have the signature define the return type as suitable your other issue is that the subquery for state will actually return an instead of a single entry can use the extension method with ef to get the first matching although if you have the foreign key relationship the model should have setup an navigation property for the state as well and you should be able to use the property attached instead of a so if you would like to have this as a method call that returns a list of objects you will have to create a type that represents the transform or downcast to otherwise you could do it at the form level all depends on your where you are attempting to bind the var results from r in select state state not hostaddress timestamp return like i said the other alternative is to either create a class for the transform or bind the list directly to the class public string state public string hostaddress public datetime timestamp just add the class to the ala new and change the method signature to reflect the class and remove the cast in the

you link against you are in the so instead of developing an api for this command line just write a little wrapper that interacts with the program directly on the command you are not and now are just executing a binary your code will not have to be released under the may use exec and friends to do it is a simple solution and depending on how the application expects its input on the command line it can work very well based stuff is harder need a terminal of some the comments it sounds like even this is not and could still cause i suggest contacting a lawyer to make sure you are in the he will be able to interpret the gpl and tell you what you may and may not do with would think that just executing an program and then sending it data piping data into should not cause your program to also be gpl is too if i use a command line tool by executing it and piping data to it my program can still become that is just give me and or mit anytime of way simpler to

you make any changes to an with simply because it would change the number of items in the 1st method you showed are since count could start out as 20 but if you remove 10 items with your count will still be 20 and you would go out of bounds on the if you want to remove add stuff while iterating over it you have to do something i i if the if you remove say is your loop would count 0 is remove it our count 1 is remove it our count 2 is remove it what was previously will be our our count 2 this helps

you need to do is autofit to the cell range the header	
you need to do is nullify all the pointers to the object you just the idea of pointers is that there will be more than one pointer storing the address of the same if there is little reason to use a bare and so the pattern trying to capture is not very useful but you are far from the first person to try as other answers have the only way to deal with pointers is to carefully control access to title of your question is absolutely a good reason for a pointer identifies a location that stores an object of a specific a pointer to a pointer gives you the ability to change what object a pointer points new class derives from and so does my suppose the compiler allowed you to do expected that to but if it then we would now have a pointer that in fact pointers to an instance of who says those two types are this is a very frequent misunderstanding it crops up repeatedly here for other especially with regard to and in

you need to post the data use one easy option is to create a form element on the attach input elements with the values you need and submit you can do that like so if you use var get the mail id of this not sure where since i have the html that makes if let me very first line is a jquery shortcut way of saying the document is done when the page is done going to attach an event listener to elements in the when one of those elements is we can then extract the mail id whatever else you that is in relation to that particular table if you had html like 8435 is the mail id in this we could extract the variable like we are going to attach a hidden form element to the end of the body of the html really matter where we put it since it is the end is in this form we set the method to post and the action to whatever php file you need to post i also set an id so easily referred to in the next now going to select the form element using its id and going to append a new hidden input element to it with the appropriate name value going to use the javascript submit method to trigger the submit event on the this is basically equivalent to pressing the button on a normal it it should work

you need to understand is the scope of the variables in javascript is based on the this is an important difference than say where you have block and just copying the variable to one inside the for will it in a function that evaluates returning the function like answer will do the as the variable now has the function is also a let keyword instead of that would allow using the block scope in that case defining a variable inside the for would do the that the let keyword a practical solution because of funcs i i let index to the j j	
you need to use instead of latter would need an iterator as you use a slightly different loop it current can even overcome the problem mentioned of a logic object during invalidate iterators except of the ones pointing to the removed from i also vote for this being a variation of the singleton and i would suggest for keeping the original solution with a separate management just in case you want to have to have two loops with different delta times or explicit multithread support logic objects on different or whatever in the my opinion this is a general advantage of the singleton class over static methods you could always you can easily multiply your functionality if you want to do so in the future

you put projects b and c into the same solution as project a then no way to make sure you have binaries for b and c containing the latest source code when you build project easiest solution seen is to have a common folder in the source code repository where every project copies its binaries if they need to be then all other projects can reference binaries in that folder as long as your local folders look the same as the a perfect but pretty easy to work

you refer to will be easier in via which does pretty much what you are already but go creating your own structs like crazy you rarely need them are more there is no real concept of a people have syntax changes would have the compiler do the check on but in does this and there are some things you can do in but it probably worth the other thought on a class one of the reasons they what would be for a the spec that is well

you touch a member in your class from the you need to provide a that the compiler creates the function in the dll itself and makes it the compiler know which methods are used by the clients of a class it must enforce that all methods are must enforce that all members which can be accessed by clients must their functions this happens when the compiler is warning you of methods not exported and the linker of the client sending every member must be marked with with private members not touchable by here you can the warnings of compiler generated the members must export their declaring them with does not export the methods of these you have to mark the according classes in their as it boils down to not you have members which be used by switch off the you have members which must be used by create a wrapper or create indirection cut down the count of externally visible members use methods like class does create an instantiation of the template specialization in the current compilation so this creates the methods of in the dll and exports the corresponding this does not work for concrete classes as this is only an instantiation of template

you want to merge most but not all of the commits on branch to for you can do it requires some as mentioned the usual use case is to merge everything from a but sometimes it happens that you made a change to a release version that be integrated back that been superceded in master so how do you represent here suppose maint has had 5 changes and one of those is not to be merged back into although all the others should you do this in three actually merge everything before that tell git to mark as merged even when it and then merge the the magic git merge git merge ours git merge first command merges everything your troublesome maint commit onto the default merge log message will explain merging second command merges the troublesome but the option tells git to use a special in works by simply keeping the tree you are merging into and ignoring the you are merging but it does still make a new merge commit with head and as the so the revision graph now says that is so in fact you probably want to use the option to as to explain that that commit is actually being final command simply merges the rest of maint into master so that all synced up

you want to store schema and generate tables on i would recommend you review the schema for it stores enough information that you could generate the create statement for a given table but not personally i think it is less overhead to the stored procedures based on the schema of the table they will be interacting similar to what is described in	
you want to store the dates seperately so you can juggle with query do you just want to store the array as you want to store the dates separately you may want to create a table with an fk to a column for date and a column for the nature of the like you would indeed store the single dates into that if you by iterating but if you can with one of it is not recommended to have within you just need to store that array you can serialize it and store the serialized string in a text or varchar	
you want to take the and challenging i would suggest the you want to take something and challenge i would suggest taking the suggest skimming a short anecdote about my c programming experience that i wrote i learn the past 3 years i have been doing c only development as an electrical engineer and i have found the experience to be a c programmer you will find for performance and designing lots of low level building blocks that are taken for granted in higher level coding for doing some coding for performance and developing i will have to say that i am i find it really exciting and i find to be one of the most challenging and interesting implementing lots of low level building first i was very annoyed at having to implement my own low level but as time progressed i realized that it takes real skill to successfully implement something like a circular buffer that is fast and in the if i need to implement some fancy data structure with lots of dynamic memory usage and pointers i will easily be able low level implementation work also makes using any of the higher level work very very easy because once you have done low level work the high level stuff is memory almost forgot to mention this because in c you are forced to make decisions about memory every couple of and you even realize it after a basically this is probably one of the best parts of c because it forces you to think about how you are using memory always and as a result you become much much more proficient in using consider blocks to be more interesting and challenging than the higher level explain my opinion of higher level languages using my experience using higher level has been and because feel like a child who is given a box of legos to build something can build many things with legos and they can be very but you are to the tools in your lego resultant output sometimes a tendency to look similar to other lego process of building your lego output is not as challenging as building your own lego pieces and then building your project from your own obligatory warning about metaphors and how they are useful for getting a point across but not for completely explaining

you written this code yet in and if have you profiled i would argue that you probably need to worry about the objects being in contiguous memory the jvm is better at memory management than you are in a garbage collected really concerned about maybe java the right tool for the but my gut instinct is to tell you that worrying about optimization too and that a java version of your working with will probably suit your

your business logic can vary depending on what method returns and thus it is ok to your method to return empty list then go with an exception if your business logic has no intend to have an empty if it is because of wrong passed go with assert or logic if it is because of external data problem like database connection or filesystem error then ggo with runtime go with it will be very hard to understand this behavior

your problem was that fancy error correction mechanism prevented you from knowing that there was a syntax error in the back in 1982 or running tex on a long document would take so much time that knuth want tex to just quit when it ran into an tex tries to guess what you meant and go on typesetting the so that you can fix a bunch of errors before you run it for when it spots a command outside math it assumes that you forgot a dollar sign and inserts no automatic mechanism is so syntax errors often cause some part of text to be or typeset in a wrong does try to tell you that it has found but i suppose current ides make it easy to ignore the try running latex on the document from the command line and pay attention to what it for the short seems i forgot some dollar tex to prompt you missing it seems i forgot some dollar 2009 way of dealing with this is to type x to fix the source and run latex again but you can actually enter other commands at the prompt to edit the input that tex if you just type q run quietly same as specifying which emacs or whatever ide you are using probably does for you get a typeset document as a and it might not be obvious that there are in fact syntax errors in	
your question has so the solution will here are two ways to do the quick and dirty way will only partially solve your issue because it be able to account for the more odd permutations like missing spaces or misspelled the quick and dirty a new table call a text field in it you want to replace it for this example all the char or char combinatios that you want removed in this and run the query that it will only remove at a but you can also versions of the in it too like this example i created a table called with a field called top 1 char from tchar where order by as better much more this explanation is going to be general because it would be next to impossible to put the whole thing in if you want to contact me directly use my user name at a table of qualifiers that people enter like of here you every wierd permutation a table with qualifierid here you would say goes to which a query that joins the your table with mistaken in use instr so say in the a second query the count field and use it as a entry with the highest score will have to hand enter the but pretty soon be next to none as you and more entries in the have a couple different in access there is no case in you need to use not quite as elegant as the solutions in the more robust db engines and needs to be nested for this but it will get the job done for as could also do it using the sql to limit your as shiptoplant btst left join select shiptoplant from btst where shiptoplant not as abtst on you know vb you can also create your own functions and put them in the that is another
