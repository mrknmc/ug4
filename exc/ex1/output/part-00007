 a hard comparison to make because differences in the respective stacks mean you end up doing the same thing differently and if you do them the same for the purpose of comparison not a very realistic which i is in its most basic form loaded with every interpreted and then it is very much like cgi in this respect is no surprise considering it is roughly 15 years over the years various optimisations have been made to improve the most notably opcode caching with for example much so that apc will be a standard part of php 6 and not an optional module like it is still php scripts are basically session information is file based and mutually exclusive blocks other scripts accessing the same user session until or the script whereas not the case in aside from session fairly easy to have objects that live within the application context in java for that which is much more similar is a key for database access in php is transient connections whereas will nearly always use persistent connection pools and build on top of this to create orm frameworks and the the caches for which are beyond any particular a bytecode interpreted is theoretically faster but the limits to what php can do are so high as to be irrelevant for most 4 of the top 20 visited sites on the internet are php for speed of cost of running the tend to be far more important when you start to scale than any theoretical speed in mind that has primitive type safety and these sorts of things that will make code faster than php can run if you want to do a somewhat unfair sort an array of one million random 64 bit integers in both will kill it because they are primitive types and simple arrays will be more efficient than associative arrays all arrays in php are associative plus php on a 32 bit os have a native 64 bit integer so will suffer hugely for should also be pointed out that is whereas php is interpreted opcode which can make a difference but the flexibility of php in this regard is a good being able to deploy a script without bouncing your server is just drop it in and it but it is less performant though i think arguing really an irrelevant

 a lot that i could write about of libraries i create my own versions of cpan with just the modules i the latest versions of has several such as the option to load to help with once you have you can distribute it on a or cd which has all of the the and everything else you with a little programming you create a script that make it all integration i integrate the the road to i do integration testing with the application which automatically tests all of its dependencies the switch to the cpan command is useful to test the module in the current working are various intergation testing frameworks that you can use you set perl5lib to something empty only have the core modules in the so has to install everything from control friendly it much matter what you most things have some sort of export where you can get everything without the source control git is very nice because it only has a minimum of pollution in the normal platform everything mentioned works just fine on windows and perl install this part is more and i think going in the wrong any time multiple things have to depend on the same someone is going to mess it up for the i definitely recommend not using the system perl for application development just so you mess up the operation of the at the every application should install all modules into their own directories so they compete with other start up just a simple matter of i use the wrong way to go since you have to depend what thinks you should i use which simply takes a directory of template toolkit templates and processes them to give them your distribution you can do anything that you how you get the initial templates is up to d

 a performance perspective you should be better off storing the as files and just keeping a reference to the location in the this will save you from having to transfer the data from the database to the web server and reconstitute the via a handler whenever it is of caching could help this but still pay the penalty on each cache this solution is for my somewhat less complicated in terms of the code that needs to be developed though you do have issues with collisions and some extra security setup to do if you are enabling

 a protocol adds no code to the compiled app it only enforces the that your class must implement the methods to be considered to a good use of this would be to generate a group of classes with all the way of or you could create a category for then a class that conforms to must play and type if it the compiler issues a warning but compiles the class in your code you obj category actually adds new methods dynamically to your these methods are globally accessible to the runtime as selectors and can be called by name as in category idea is to add special new code to a class even if you have the source code for that so of course there may be security problems and you could create memory leaks in your case in a separate file avaudioplayerdelegate foo do foo return it as a category of makes all classes respond to foo can be a stand alone method as use a category to add a quick method to a protocols for and sublcasses to specialize existing classes like adding member variables or major new categories can also be used to override a method or two when a subclass is not needed and but usually if you want to add functionality to a class you make a the objc book and do some

 a rather extreme approach check out roy timothy yuan vesta approach to software configuration vesta approach is based on the following versioned storage of all sources and vesta uses explicit version numbers rather than configuration by we the descriptions name all elements contributing to a every aspect of the computing including header environment is fully described and controlled by we mean that configuration descriptions specify how to system from scratch using only immutable sources descriptions themselves are versioned and immutable and is a particular description always describes precisely the same build using the same even after new versions and descriptions have been derived file the storage and naming of derived managed automatically by the vesta storage thereby easing of building multiple releases or building for multiple target caching of all build vesta features a shared build results so developers can benefit from each dependency the vesta builder dynamically detects all so none can be omitted by human by we mean that the builder detects which sources are actually used process of constructing a build result and records dependencies only dependency analysis does not make use of any knowledge the build tools it is thus in the terminology of gunter for if a compiler reads file in the compiling file vesta will assume that the output all of even though a tool with knowledge of c might be able to items in that could be changed without changing the the

 achieve that you need to change the control template of the treeviewitem using the itemcontainerstyle of the treeview is the style that gets applied to any item in the root of the default treeviewitem is not so it does not extend all the way to the you set the it is inside the treeviewitem and so cannot extend past will not post the whole style because it would be way too what to do in your right click and chose control a save the style wherever you in the expand the stuff and locate the which is a change its rowspan property to set the property of your item to on the item or through the style if you need to apply that to several item should now be the correct this only applies to the item you if you want that to work for any item you add to the you need to change the of the treeview to the newly created and remove the style that blend placed on the but not you need to set the itemcontainerstyle of your treeviewitem to that same style so that its children also extend all the and so on and so in the with your example and a child node on the first is the style that blend created for the full style as generated by blend and it is long because it basically is a copy of the style with minor

 advantage of using folders is that you need to have a custom handler that fetches those blobs out of a database and turns them into regular also simpler to host them from different locations and avoid the burden on the database have to be careful about storing the relative pathnames work better as urls and will allow you some flexibility and scaling in where you store how you serve and so van den

 afraid stuck with and	
 afraid the short answer is that you do this using the filefield or imagefield they just store a file path and have no real concept of the actual the long is that anything is possible if you leverage the django api for writing your own model a want to implement the method to convert the data for serialization an example in the django docs at the link note that the examples at the url link above also include mention of subclassing filefield and which is helpful for your also have to decide if the data should therefore be stored in the or on the file if the you will have to implement your custom class as a blob including customization for every db you wish to also have to provide some support for how the data should be returned to the user out of the database when the html requests a if the which is the smarter way to go have to implement methods for binary data to the either if you implement these as subclasses of filefield and you should still be able to use the admin tools and other modules that expect such django and only if you elect to use the more involved blob a snippet of code from an old project of mind when i was learning that handles blob for mysql and probably be able to find a number of improvements as i touched it since it does not handle so have to add that using the method import import the blob value so that we can override the unicode after the query django attempts to record the last and at that point it attempts to force the query to this does not work for binary data and generates uncaught def def return def return field for persisting binary data in databases that we def if return elif return raise def if if value is return return return def if value is return if return return

 after the filters join the try to join and then reason is that you lose use of your fulltext in response to the using the word join generically not as but as a synonym for merge or essentially saying you should use the first or something like the reason faster is that each of the subqueries is sufficiently uncluttered that the db can use that full text index to do the select very joining the two much result sets is also this means the whole thing is slow version winds up walking through lots of data testing it to see if what you rather than quickly winnowing the data down and only searching through rows you are likely to actually

 ago we had character set detection for a mail and we rolled our the mail app was actually a wap and the phone expected there were several could easily detect if text was as there is a specific bit pattern in the top bits of bytes once you found that pattern repeated a certain number of times you could be certain it was the file begins with a byte order you can probably assume the rest of the text is that detecting nearly as easy as unless you can detect the surrogate pairs but the use of surrogate pairs is so that usually is except there are no surrogate pairs to we would assume the reader was in a certain for if the user was seeing the ui localized in we could then attempt detection of the three main japanese is again east to detect with the escape if that determining the difference between and is not as more likely that a user would receive but there were characters in that exist in and so sometimes you could get a good same procedure was used for chinese encodings and other these provide satisfactory the user must manually choose an	
 agree that 32k items is a ridiculous amount to have in a that being you might try adding the items to a tstringlist first and then use a combination of and add your items to the code but i test it further than never felt the need to add more than a few dozen items to a combobox or if any more items might be needed than i find a way to filter before populating the list so there are fewer out of how do you expect a user to sort through that many items to make a	
 agree that it could be an issue between local swfs and remote try uploading your local file to a server server you have access if got a local apache or iis try accessing that swf using if that know that the issue is in going between a local file and a remote if it than the issue is either with or in your which is less likely but we rule it out just if you do determine that the issue is with using a local then add the local folder in the settings manager	
 agree that it may seem like overkill to have an business layer but my question if the business classes are essentially empty wrappers for the dal is the business logic in the app being in these i often see it spread throughout the ui and dal code in the which defeats the entire purpose of having a business layer in the first you are going to have a business then it should encapsulate as much of the business logic as including validation and various methods of if you essentially let the business layer be a bunch of data transfer it is not providing any value and you should probably consider developing your architecture without

 agree with jeremy what describing need the complexity of callback the worker nodes could simply expose a wcf service even a wsdl or rest web service for that and then the controller would simply need to know the urls of each of the child nodes and send messages to the worker you want the controller to be able to broadcast a single message and have all of the worker really dislike the i long ago switched to calling it nodes do something in response and post their progress back to the then you might want to use the often underrated p2p channel available within this allows a group of services written in wcf to talk to each other all at once as peers with urls being used almost like for you might issue commands on the only the controller sends commands on that channel but all of the worker nodes when done doing their thing they can report progress back on the an added benefit of this approach is that you need this the individual workers would gain the ability to know what all the other workers are in however that if you use p2p then have to deal with contention you may end up with 2 nodes accepting the same if this is then p2p is your if you need commands to be issued and only picked up serially by individual nodes as they become free more likely scenario when telling remote nodes to run individual test then you can use a msmq binding instead of then all of the workers become clients which receive messages from the queue and you can more easily counteract the situation of multiple workers accepting the same additional blog post i wrote a while back on the peer channel scenarios on this is good because you can go from here to peer channel concepts to the reference channel team	
 agree with matt at akqa we have svn locations four our source and we set up an svn ignore for the bin folders of a that way we checking any swfs which means when we update we get someone elses swfs or output good bet is to look into continuous integration with something like cruise we build our output on the server which generates all of the files into one location on the there are loads of other benefits of continous integration and well worth

 all the big hardisks even developers seem to forget how many bytes there are in a so to answer the question in the games store large amounts of data by creating savegames that are several megabyte illustrate how big a megabyte 8 million that is sufficient to encode in there are only atoms in the now in a there are multiple subsystems with distinct in a rpg each npc has its own but how much of a state is their position in a town might be saved as 16 bits you remember their position if walking around their as another 8 and that allows for more emotions then some people it comes to storing this kind of data the typical datastructure is a this is a datastructure that allows you to determine objects in a certain region in in some game developers find it easier to the world in this reduces the amount of a good example was its maps had visibility for each point one could determine quickly to which zone it and for each zone the amount of visible objects was this reduced the amount of objects that needed runtime visibility

 always a risk when adding new stuff to a project in the especially when the new stuff is replacing old basically any code that depended on the old code needs to be tested this is part of the risk and cost of risk comes with assuming that everything works then it a but what happens when a then the cost goes up because extra time is needed to go through the cycle only time this would make sense in the middle is if you done any of the testing if that were the then i would be more worried about the overall quality in general because i would prefer such a layer would have been thoroughly tested throughout the	
 always been a fan of using one table instead of breaking it up into an table and a i put 4 columns on these all and are fairly the and timestamps are for when the record was actually the the record would have a time prior to and a by separating out the and you can schedule changes to take place in the as opposed to the allows you to easily write queries that will automatically operate on the right suppose your table is storing the tax rate over you want to have all your queries that use tax rates in their calculations have the extra complexity of deciding to look stuff up in a history table when processing old for you can just look up the tax rate in effect at the time the invoice was created in one regardless of whether the current tax rate or idea is not originally mine i did the rough idea on my own prior to reading about you can find a detailed discussion of it in this

 am new to artificial i understand k nearest neighbour algorithm and how to implement how do you calculate the distance or weight of things that on a distance of age can be easily but how do you calculate how near is red to maybe colours is a bad example because you still can say use the how about a burger to pizza to fries for got a feeling a clever way to do you in advance for your kind thank you all for very nice it really helped and i appreciate but i am thinking there must be a way i do it this say i am using my knn algorithm to do a prediction for a person whether will eat at my restaurant that serves all three of the above of other factors but to keep it for the field of favourite out of 300 150 loves 100 loves and 50 loves common sense tells me favourite food affect decision on whether to eat or now a person enters favourite food as burger and i am going to predict whether going to eat at my ignoring other and based on my previous knowledge common sense tells me that a higher chance the k nearest distance for this particular field favourite food is nearer as compared to if he entered pizza or only problem with that is that i used and i might be wrong because i know and probably calculate the actual i also worry about this field putting too little weight on my prediction because the distance probably to scale with other factors time of whether the restaurant is etc that i can easily but i guess i might be able to get around it with some parameter everyone put up a great but i can only accept in that just accept the one with highest votes thank you all once nearest neighbour algorithm

 am trying to learn c and i was studying some source codes and there are some things i especially regarding bitwise i read some sites on and i kinda got an idea on what they but when i went back to look at this i could not understand why and how where they first question is not related to bitwise operators but rather some ascii somebody explain to me how the following code a x a undertand this is done to convert a char into an however i understand the logic behind does it regarding bitwise i feel really lost does this code n read somewhere that inverts but i fail to see what this statement is doing and why is it doing with this ret exacly is the operator from what i is or but i quite understand what is this statement there any way of rewriting this code to make it easier to understands so that it use this bitwise i find them very confusing to so hopefully somebody will point me in the right direction on understanding how they work a lot in advance for taking your taking to respond to this you very much to everyone for your excellent responses i have a much better understanding of bitwise operators now and the whole code makes much more sense i really appreciate your help and last appartenly nobody responded if there would be a way for rewriting this code in a way that its easier to understand and maybe not at any thank you all very random c questions magic and bitwise

 am trying to place an action to happen after an entire page the is a function that uses the response object to send a file to the detailed am trying to replicate the behavior of a link on the from a i have a link on the main page for the export and it works fine since the page is already displayed before the user clicks but when the user is on a clicks the it should take them back to this main page and then send the file after it did some research and thought that using the pagecomplete event would be for so i created my event handler and put the call to the export code keys off of a query string when loaded from the inside my pagecomplete event but it behaves just the same way the browser download box pops up and the page is never loaded before or it helps to understand what doing here is a snippet of the code used to send the list to the would prefer a way to use a page event to load the rather than tinkering with this if there is a clean and easier way to get the file and it allows for loading the page then sending the that would be fine there another page event i can use besides or is it possible i am missing sorry about the i realize that i change the way http requests work only looking for an acceptable solution that achieves more or less the same it seems like the way to go is to force a refresh of the page after a couple of seconds ensuring that it loads before the file download code is so i am looking for a way to do this as the first answer suggests refresh to a have to be delayed if a way to refresh with no this code private void if if if supposed to after page loading is do a reloading itself with a different query when it reaches the page loadcomplete event the second time it will trigger the function which writes out the it actually apparently repeats the same problem it goes back to the same how do you execute an action after the page or wait until the page completely finishes then trigger a refresh which will execute the is there no way for to do something by itself without the user clicking on the then an after 2 seconds would also be but not sure how to do pagecomplete event troubles and file

 am working on a project which will be using large datasets 2d and which i will be turning into or in order to render will also be performing calculations on these which to use for each calculation depend on the greatest and smallest values of their i need to sort the in order of their greatest valued have tried and binary insertion quicksort so far offers the quickest solution but it is still quite slow due to the size of the data was thinking along the lines of a sort when creating the in the first a bucket for each of the greatest valued vertices adding pointers to the triangles who all have that value as the value of their greatest valued approach should be linear in but requires more memory this is not an but my programming language of choice is and not entirely sure how i would go about coding such a thing my question to you how would you go about getting the in such a way that you could iterate through from the triangle whos vertex with the greatest value of its 3 vertices is the greatest valued vertex in the entire data all the way down to the triangle with the the smallest greatest vertex to sort a bunch of by a specific value at their vertices some other distance

 and compilation are quite but tend to get lumped together because of both being considered of a simple architecture such as a 6502 or z80 will be fairly straightforward for the cpu chunk of the but there will be a fair chunk of code to write since you need to have a function for each want to automate this in some from an instruction set specification with all the timings and as typing this all out will be very tedious indeed old cpu instruction set specs are easy to so this helps a lot when building top of that need to implement some level of which usually involves handling and generating interrupts as the interrupt of a display device if the emulator is for a game this again will need some level of specification and code but likely have to write most of this by hand as not going to be quite so repetitive hence as the instruction set will involve some sort of language spec of whatever language you are going to be implementing the compiler and a target which you will be aiming to output code the output could be straight to could be assembly or could even be another language is really just a but it counts as compilation when the target is considered since be running on some sort of hardware or vm platform then you will be unlikely to have to worry about interrupt handling and that sort of for both are and for the emulator need to make it work very accurately unless you pick very simple things to also need to create some sort of integrated debugger for the otherwise close to impossible to tell what is going wrong when it invariably does for a compiler it should be fairly straightforwward to translate a toy language or a small subset of a more complex and build it up as you go that with both of these items you need to be able to produce input to test and if you cannot produce simple inputs then find it very difficult to get debug from the very alone makes compiler work easier to get and that want to have something which emulates a full console or something straight away

 apologize again for this very surprised at how hibernate really i think it would do all of this and i really even sure what i was trying to as i responded to comments i started to refine the question in my head and was able to then find the answer i was looking thanks to everyone who answer hibernate does this you have in your database table a with a primary key and a table b that has a primary key called that references table you create the following classes class a private string getter and class b extends a private string getter and map them like you can return a and b objects using a simple as in the following query objects b a it does is return a list of objects using the query and then walks through them printing out aproperty from our a class if the class is of type the bproperty from our b hibernate query in this case is automatically polymorphic and will give you a b object when	
 apologize for the long paste of code but this has been bugging me for a good few hours working on porting my entire site over into a new and trying to make the various areas and things more so i can contain most of them in resizeable dockable windows and a very neat concept working out pretty got one page with an external style sheet that i figure out for the life of regardless of the vertical size of the showing a scrollbar and like 20px of extra blank page at the checked and but all of my divs seem to be and the only real odd bits which involve negative fix the issue when is the html i use on the page generated dynamically a this is a dump from when logged html public xhtml page scripts generic scripts that backgroud all the tags open in new hee hee good luck var url the url based on a select few if url the value of action for the var type if var type return top top bottom bottom tieractivecheckbox a nova and devote your clan to that tieractivecheckbox an attack with a mage that has an item at least 2 treasure from another player in a single tieractivecheckbox 2 tieractivecheckbox an attack on a player who is devoted to a different nova than you tieractivecheckbox a member of a at least one new player to the game using the invite the player must verify their account to qualify for the top top bottom bottom tieractivecheckbox in first place after 3 or attack someone who has joined the light tieractivecheckbox in second place after 3 or attack someone who has joined the dark at least 25 treasure to your tieractivecheckbox an attack on someone between 12 am and 8 at least 10 treasure from another player in a single an attack on a player who has at least 5 levels of defense on each of his mages at tieractivecheckbox an attack on someone on a top top bottom bottom the highest ranked recruit after 1 or win an attack on an enemy this is the corresponding css this is body information for the to theme the whole body the same color as the jquery will change this to black for so a indicator of any syntax errors in the may be changed to be trebuchet windowing information here omitted seem the classes here used the problem classes to describe the one class for each hidden and the respective class is shown based on whether or not its parent has the container for a tier holds the checkbox and the text this is just wrong empty designed to make sure some breathing room below the floated aesthetics stuff 0px 0px appologize for the css a lot of duplicates sprinkled in but much prefer to understand making it the body area before i go on a does anyone see anything blatantly obvious that missing the only thing i can do to that page to make the scrollbars is to omit which makes it look rather craptastic set up a live version so you can see what supposed to look scrollbar and this will gain me several hours of sleep back if someone can point out what does my css force a scrollbar to appear regardless of content	
 app engine offers free quotas of 1 gb outbound traffic per day and on a ghz intel x86 per do those free quotas compare to web hosting for the traffic supported by the free quotas is that generally higher or less than the traffic supported by a typical shared hosting the free google charges per gb outgoing per gb incoming per per gb storage per do those numbers translate to normal web hosting for the traffic that can be supported by a vps plan and dedicated server what would they cost on google app know it depends on a lot of but if anyone has any ballpark estimates or experiences willing to share really appreciate trying to decide between app engine and standard web hosting for a python the site will start but if the traffic grows i want to see which would be a better option long does google app engine compare to web hosting

 appears that actually operates in a different order than include include pasted the c code that implements the method in ruby int value value int for while return if not familiar with c pretty clear that this function has a for loop iterating upward to check that the type of all the arguments is and then uses a while loop iterating downward to actually include the modules so the modules in would actually be included in the order i gone through all the rails modules in but i imagine something that started failing once the include order was switched

 application modifying has a web and one of the web methods on that web methods is used to authenticate a user against active so the current code called by the authenticateuser web method looks something like domainandusername adomain ldspath entry new to the native adsobject to force object obj directorysearcher search new username searchresult result more code to validate the i started looking at this the first thing that worried me is the arguments to the web method look like resultobj string string code that calls above authentication the current web service is expecting a password presumably in the over the network as when the request is made to the anyone dealt with this type of issue are there alternative active directory authentication mechanisms i could use that would avoid having to pass in a the best option i could come up with on my own is to invoke the webmethod using an encrypted and have the code on the other side decrypt prefer a better is there some way to do search for a directoryentry using a hash instead of a to this point i considered ssl as this is a tool that is internal to our so it seems like and possibly problematic be running on a company and not externally the only reason even worried about the security of sending passwords is the escalating amount of malware present even on company intranets these password solution for a web service authenticating against active

 approach here is often to simply use a poll have the clients query for data every time that avoids a whole family of issues you can have callbacks on duplex channels the server to actively send a message to but this is more i value so i usually just that help here are designing the system to have an inbuilt mechanism for querying since for an audit perhaps fed by database the exact details vary per of option that you might want to look at is sync this does much of what you ask for keeping a local copy of the database up to date with the server but has a few complexities of its this is available in the database vs	
 approach is a bit more putting the filter parameters in tables and then using group having and count to filter the used this basic approach several times for some very sophisticated and it works very well me also join on the artist and venue dimension tables get the results as needing and then join the results on the artist and venue tables to get those dimension search for the entity in a sub then in an outer query get the dimension values you keeping them separate should improve table table into id from name in into id from name in as as as as on as on on as on between and interval 1 from from on a netbook and suffering for so leave out the outer query getting the artist and venue names from the artist and venue tables option would be to filter the and tables in whether this is worth it depends on how influential the join on the concert table my assumption here is that there are many artist and but once filtered on the concert table filtered by the the number of decreases there is often a to deal with the case where no are from experience it is better to deal with this that use if statements and queries specially suited to those a single sql query can be written to handle but is much slower than the programatic writing similar queries several times may look messy and degrade but the increase in complexity need to get this to be a single query is often harder to similar layout could filter concert by artist as filter results by venue as join results on dimension tables to get etc inner inner group inner inner group cascading the each subsequent filtering has a reduce set it has to work this may reduce the work done by the group by having section of the for two levels of filtering i would guess this to be unlikely to be original may still be more performant as it benefits additional filtering in a different in your there may be many artist in your date but few which meet at least one there may be many venues in your date but few which meet at least one before the group all concerts are eliminated the meets none of the the venue meets none of the criteria you are searching by many criteria this filtering also where venues artists share a lot of the filtering also when would i use the or when would i use the cascaded original few search criteria and are from each cascaded lots of search criteria or tend to be similar

 approach taken is too move the code out of the event handlers essentially placed a class next to the which implements the event handlers and holds the ui state beside the this move i have gained a pretty clear seperation of the form and the actual interaction with the remaining app and was able to introduce tests at that another result of this was that the view becomes passive pretty refactor the presenter now holds the event in a seperate step and introduce domain objects only after moved all uses of these objects out of all my steps would the ui dependency from the domain objects not available the presenters to use the domain services according to your design choice while at i did this i started introducing tests at the newly introduced boundaries to ensure that not breaking working code or to find bugs in the existing code	
 approach to solving the problem is a script that ensures that your daemon like this signal handling should be added for proper echo file exit write own pid python force removal of pid in case of unexpected rm sleep for 2 sleep this the server will stay alive even if it dies	
 approaches come to set the server to be optimized for file this used to be in the properties for file printer but seems to have gone away in windows this is set via the registry as ensure that both endpoints are either windows or windows there are significant performance improvements in smb as well as the ip stack which improve performance this may not be an option due to organizational or procurement lead but i thought mention as	
 approaches that test the existence of are because there is no way to check whether a file exists and create it in a single atomic because of there is a race condition that make your attempts at mutual exclusion you need to use creates a directory if it exist and if it it sets an exit more it does all this in a single atomic action making it perfect for this mkdir echo is already exit all see the excellent you want to take care of stale comes in the only downside here is that the operation takes about a so it a function i wrote once that solves the problem using mutex open a mutual exclusion lock on the unless another process already owns if the file is already locked by another the operation this function defines a lock on a file as having a file descriptor open to the this function uses fd 9 to open a lock on the to release the close fd exec local pid pids exec for pid in exec return 1 locked by a done can use it in a script like echo exit you care about portability solutions should work on pretty much any unix offers some additional options and there is also

 architecture of ajax actually overwrites the entire html inside the it update values there are three options for the textboxes and checkboxes in seperate update looks like this work for your sure to transfer the values on postback to ensure that the controls remain the same they will actually be but if they are overwritten with the same value this be a different ajax method that calls back to a instead of using ajax for use javascript to call the and then update the values individually instead of replacing the controls like ajax this is easy with the get or	
 are a couple of different approaches and you could certainly use firstly you could remove some common code in to a separate project and just call that code this is pretty easy to do and i sometimes take this approach with simple helper functions that probably belong in a class in my main project a good example would be a math library or something like the other approach is to extract common functionality in to a class or interface which you then inherit and depending on what code you are looking to reuse you might use either of these suspect you will find it easier than you try it with some simple set up a new project in the same reference your library from your existing code and see how it there is also no reason not to reference your shared project in multiple solutions shared code libraries need not be a problem if the development gets handed for now you can have your 2 sites reference the same library which you but if and when you split the projects out to other teams you can give a copy of the shared code to each	
 are a few but they are messier than the way you are already i suggest you stick with the current go ahead and embed the sql in the code since you are doing it be extra careful to validate your input to avoid sql messiness the only problem with dynamic remember the dynamic sql thwarts the ability to create a reusable execution the executesql command breaks the ownership that means the code will run in the context of the user who calls the stored procedure not the owner of the this might force you to open security on whatever table the statement is running against and create other security	
 are a few different ways to track is to link the advertisement any to a redirection you would normally pass it some sort of id so it knows which url it should forward but before redirecting the user to that page it can first record that click in a database where it can store the users browser it will then forward the user them really to the specified redirection script landing way to do it is to use pixel this is where you put a or a piece of javascript code onto the body of a the pixel is just an image a script posing as an which will then be requested by the user visiting the the tracker which hosts the pixel can record the relevant information by that image some systems will use javascript instead of an image they use to track this may allow them to gain slightly more information using landing page user requests pixel is an example of a threw in the png at the end because some systems might require a valid image you do not want the user to know what the tracker is you can put code on your landing page to pass data to your this would be done on the backend so it is invisible to the essentially you can just the tracker url while passing relevant data via the get the tracker would then record that data with very limited server load on the landing landing page requests tracker url and concurrently renders

 are a few options the brute force approach will lead to a lot of frustration unless what tracking is very for this you could use any number of genetic approaches to train your program what to after enough generations it would do the right thing if the thing you want to track is visually obvious a red ball on a white then you could detect it yourself through simple brute force scanning of the approach would be just looking at the memory of the running and figuring out what area is controlling the position of your for some more info and ideas on see how mumble got 3d positional audio working in various

 are a few things i would like to respond i think and vinay all have good this explains why calling the destructor on a local variable is a bad realize this is just a simple homework problem and you are probably just trying to keep your stack class but you might consider a container class instead of an array of in your stack not sure your emptystack and create functions are doing what you think they are when you declare your original and reversed stack classes in the main program the memory is allocated for your internal character not really necessary in this case to have a create perhaps if you were allocating memory on the heap for your character you would put that code into the create function you chose to leave it out of the constructor for some but not the case emptystack really doing it would be better to have empty stack set the stop member variable to at least that way the stack would appear to be empty the next time someone tried to use a lot more that could be said about this but it might be better if you tried some of the suggestions here like using the and this after your homework it will help you a lot more in the future if you find the solution

 are considering migration as one reason is but another reason is that vault does not use valid xml for its commit comments so special characters fail our automated ccnet build system a bullet character is one of and specifically causes us a a way around this has been to ask our developers to not use these characters outside the range of ascii 32 and to manually go in and code with a this may not seem like a big but not allowing these characters prevents easy of bug and other comments into the commit this slows people down and anything that hinders flow and productivity and creates frustration needs to be reduced or my it seems that there is no way to directly migrate from vault to perhaps it is possible to use another version control system as a migration middle vault othersourcecontrolproduct i think that we would either script the commits joshua suggested at the beginning of this or which more likely just commit the last few revisions and leave the vault repos around a while for this actually gives us a a good opportunity to clean out and refactor our current code and

 are dbs useful storing such and how should be a database is useful for this you could implement your own data and perhaps it would be more efficient for your specific because you can design it for that a relational database is more but you can avoid weeks or months of development time by employing a answered another question earlier today on the subject of how to handle extensible where each new has its own distinct set of many kind of each product have many your i would choose the table now suppose the himself can specify the format of in a configuration the length of each its what its values mean case of and so how do extend a implementation assume the number of packet types are relatively and then many packets are inserted with pretty much the same so you should use the ability to manage i would define an additional table for each new packet would also store the packets so each field of the packet is stored in a separate database that way you can index each column to support efficient can also define constraints so that some fields are mandatory or their values constrained by lookup leveraging the capabilities to use metadata to enforce consistent structure where already supports a declarative language for specifying fields with data why develop a different language which you then have to translate to even more suppose the data packages can varying in length and that are optional in a given packet type should permit in the corresponding

 are lots of some some tried to put more important differences is a language with a definition and a it is stable in fact has been frozen so it cannot objective caml is an implementation controlled by a small group at it continues to the evolution is managed has many caml has just caml has a number of additional among which the most prominent are probably objects and polymorphic two languages have dramatically different models of record in names of record fields must be where in two different record types in the same scope may have field names in this quirk can make porting from sml to caml a bit are quite a few syntactic libraries and standard functions are dramatically the caml library is very whereas the sml standard basis library is more for function composition is a primitive in not part of the caml the caml string library provide a fold function least not as of version implementations of many of the caml functions are unsafe for very long they blow the type systems are subtly in a type annotation on an expression is accepted if the type with the type of in is accepted only if the type is an of the type of this distinction renders the annotation in caml much less useful in because it is impossible to use a type annotation to insist that an expression is has a much more sane and sensible relationship between interfaces or and implementations or than in sml pretty much anything goes and you have to rely on the programmer to establish good in good conventions are established and enforced by the arithmetic operators are overloaded to apply to both and integer in operators are not operators are notated with an extra the programmer can control the precedence and associtivity of infix in these are determined by the first character of the this restriction limits the benefits of being able to define your own infix

 are many differences between how an actual processor handles timing and how a simulation of the processor can handle there is no one way that actual processors deal with you say it is a simple and primitive you need not worry about out of order branch etc it would be good to learn about can simply set the clock interval equal to the interval of the longest you could club all the shorter instructions in one find the longest in the that and set the clock interval to that the remaining long instructions can be allocated an interval which is equal to a multiple of the clock there is no one way to go about

 are returning a pointer to a local variable this is invalid and surprised you receive a warning about a function exits all local variables cease to exist as going out of and their memory will be used for other you are returning a pointer to this but no guarantee what will now be this case it seems that at the time of the printf call the memory contains a 0 which is treated as an empty this is actually quite you could easily end up with either garbage being printed or the program resolve this you can either pass a buffer into or have czas allocate a buffer on the heap which you later i would recommend the former because it is inline with how virtually all library functions it also avoids memory allocations where the caller must later free the struct tm time timeinfo localtime return strftime char buffer if to czas i notice that strftime took a size updated the code to use this and correctly pass back the result from as a result this is far more robust and you cannot accidentally overflow the	
 are several problems with the model used in the main one being that it express the actual dependency instead it just concatenates a bunch of definitions in a certain often resulting in definitions coming in a different order in each source the include file hierarchy of your software is something you need to know in the same way as you know your you have to know which files are included from read your source know which files are high up in the hierarchy so you can avoid accidentally adding an include so that it will be included think hard when you add a new i really need to include this other files will be drawn in when i do conventions from those already which can help class one source file one header consistently class a goes in and code templates and snippets are good here to reduce the amount of typing needed to declare each class in a separate the to avoid exposing internal members in a header the impl pattern means putting all internal members in a struct defined in the and just have a private pointer with a forward declaration in the this means that the header file will only need to include those headerfiles needed for its public and any definitions needed for its internal members will be kept out of the

 are some good let me first say that i do not really know js at but i am a unit tester and have dealt with these i first want to point out that jsunit exists if you are not using worry too much about your method calling other methods within the same this is bound to what worries me more is the creation of the other depending on how complicated it if you are instantiating a class that does all kinds of operations over the that is too heavy for a simple unit what you would prefer to do is mock out the dependency on that class so that you can have the object produce the result you would expect to receive from its operations on the without incurring the overhead of going on the network in the other object is a bit what people typically do is have a factory method to instantiate the other the factory method can based on whether or not you are testing via a whether or not to instantiate the real object or the in you may want to make the other object a member of you and within the call the or make the decision right there whether or not to instantiate the mock or the real within the setup function or within your test cases you can set special conditions on the mock object so that it will return the proper just make sure you have tests for your other functions in the same i hope this

 are two ways for specifying parameters in one is using an identifier and the other is using a parameter type the identifier list can be but the type list can to say that one function takes no arguments in a function definition you do this with an identifier do something this with a parameter type do something in a parameter type list the only one parameter type is void must have no name then that means the function takes no but those two ways of defining a function have a difference regarding what they first defines that the function takes a specific number of but neither the count is communicated nor the types of what is needed as with all function declarations that use identifier so the caller has to know the types and the count precisely so if the caller calls the function giving it some the behavior is the stack could become corrupted for because the called function expects a different layout when it gains identifier lists in function parameters is it was used in old days and is still present in lots of production they can cause severe danger because of those argument promotions the promoted argument type do not match the parameter type of the function behavior is undefined and are much less of so always use the thingy for functions without in both and definitions of type second one defines that the function takes zero arguments and also communicates that like with all cases where the function is declared using a parameter type which is called a if the caller calls the function and gives it some that is an error and the compiler spits out an appropriate second way of declaring a function has plenty of one of course is that amount and types of parameters are another difference is that because the compiler knows the parameter it can apply implicit conversions of the arguments to the type of the if no parameter type list is that be and arguments are converted to promoted types is called the default argument will become for while will become type for the if a file contains both an omitted identifier list and a parameter type the parameter type list the type of the function at the end contains a f has now a is because both declarations do not say anything the had something to say in which is that one argument is the same can be done in int first defines a function using an identifier while the second then provides a prototype for using a declaration containing a parameter type

 are various different approaches here the under two main each typically with their own benefits and in terms of effectiveness and it is probably best to choose the simplest algorithm for whatever application and only use the more complex variants if necessary for whatever that these examples use since that will deal with null elements you could do better than zero for null if if t is constrained to struct it is also you can hoist the lookup out of the function if so you use operations on the hashcodes of the individual entries which are then this will lead to the same end result regardless of are several obvious options on static int int hash foreach element in hash hash return downside of that is that the hash for is the same as the hash for if not a problem for your situation probably the simplest static int int hash foreach element in hash unchecked return is fine hence the explicit are still some nasty cases and but more likely to be particularly with in the case of lists that may contain such you could always implement a custom hashing function one that takes the index of recurrence of the specific value as a parameter and returns a unique hash code is an example of such an algorithm that gets around the aforementioned problem in a fairly efficient it also has the benefit of greatly increasing the distribution of the hash codes generated the article linked at the end for some a analysis of exactly how this algorithm produces hash codes would be quite but testing it across a large range of input values and plotting the results should verify it well static int int hash int int bitoffset stores number of occurences so far of each var valuecounts new foreach element in curhash if out bitoffset the current hash code is shifted one further left on each successive recurrence of a value to widen the 37 is an arbitrary low prime number that helps algorithm to smooth out the hash return has few if benefits over small numbers and a mix of positive and negative numbers they may lead to a better distribution of hash as a negative to offset this becomes a useless entry contributing nothing and any zero element results in a can zero not to cause this major static int int hash foreach element in int h if hash unchecked return other core approach is to enforce some ordering then use any hash combination function you the ordering itself is immaterial so long as it is static int int hash foreach element in f is any you like returning hash return has some significant benefits in that the combining operations possible in can have significantly better hashing properties of bits for but this comes at significantly higher the sort is log and the required copy of the collection is a memory allocation you avoid given the desire to avoid modifying the implementations should normally avoid allocations one possible implementation of would be similar to that given in the last example under the addition section any constant number of bit shifts left followed by a multiplication by a prime you could even use successive primes on each iteration at no extra since they only need be generated if you were dealing with cases where you could calculate and cache the hash and amortize the cost over many calls to this approach may yield superior also the latter approach is even more flexible since it can avoid the need to use the on the elements if it knows their type and instead use per byte operations on them to yield even better hash such an approach would likely be of use only in cases where the performance was identified as being a significant if you want a reasonably comprehensive and fairly overview of the subject of hash codes and their effectiveness in blog would be worthwhile in particular the a simple hashing algorithm

 arguments are handled by the shell assume you are using bash under so any terminal settings should not affect since you already have quoted the argument it ought to the only possible explanation i can think of is if your command is a wrapper script and messes up the escaping of the arguments when passing on to the real this is easy to or perhaps a bit hard to do correct wrapper script should pass all its arguments on as any other version is most likely a bug with regards to being able to handle embedded spaces this is not uncommon to do however also any occurrences of or similar are troublesome and must be written as possibly in order to handle embedded spaces and this is sinned against a reason for the not so intuitive syntax is that the original joined all arguments as which did not work for embedded then was introduced that expanded to for all parameters and if no parameters are given it should expand to unfortunately some unix vendor messed up and made expand to even in case of no and to work around this the clever not so hack of writing was making only expand if parameter is set avoiding expansion in case of no my wrapper assumption is wrong you could try to debug with outfile java find out what arguments are passed to example from running 93 vars enoent such file or enoent such file or enoent such file or enoent such file or

 assignment the lvalue on the right hand side is not needed in some newer languages like the following in there is no need to practice is very common in programs to avoid accidental assignments that were meant to be return multiple return points was enforced mainly because you want to forget to delete your if you just use raii you need to worry about there are still good reasons to minimize multiple return and sometimes it is useful to have only most modern you do not separate your code into declaration and defines for multiple header file you used to often sometimes would lead to something like the following better way to do this if your compiler supports variable c you had to declare all variables at the top of your block of even later versions of c require this but people still do contains some unique notation can still be but i mean that kind of hungarian it was very important in c to have things ix you could have completely type unsafe functions if i would have called the string my program would have course the fix to this is to use only typesafe so as long as you do that you need hungarian notation in this still it is a good idea as discussed by joel in his

 be the only real way to do this is through since i assume this is not an and i also assume you are looking for a managed i than https it is possible to use javascript to do secure hashing of passwords on the client to prevent revealing plain text passwords but this is only a problems with this approach replay attack is still a viable users with javascript enabled would be able to auth in this approach is a more complicated challenge response a along with the login the hash of the password challenge client the the hash of the password challenge must not be trusted in the page on the server and the problems with users with javascript enabled would be able to auth in this plaintext password must be stored on the server to validate the challenge and must be encrypted on disk or otherwise to be problem is not as big of a danger as it in fact when you instead use hash the hash itself is raised to the level of this point it is fairly secure to use a cookie to store a randomly generated login similar to their session but the server may want to encrypt using the referring ip as part of the iv or key to prevent other users from hijacking the i hope that provides a little bit of direction in the way of your

 been a developer for an intranet app that used a tabbed generated with html and controlled by this was way before ie7 and in it was a bit of a novelty on websites in a previous developer had discovered that if you made it look like a dialog box even down to using a grey then people usually understood the we also loaded all the content for all the tabs in the initial and had the buttons the tabbed because of most people immediately understood that they could move between tabs used javascript to hide and show the and a save would save changes to of you want to deviate from such an obvious then you need to do some usability	
 been a while since had to work with relational databases been avoiding it as much as i can in my personal and at work we use an object so fairly sure this is the correct but i wanted to make modeling a relational database from an existing object hierarchy it is generally the case that child properties should go in their own tables with a reference to the id of the parent object it seems a little backwards from an oo standpoint obviously i realize that relational is way different from but i guess the only way to represent relationships feels like it should be more accurately described as as the one parent reference the many many child entries that reference the one designing a db schema is it generally the case that tables representing a child property the oo should reference their

 been experimenting with creating an interpreter for and while quite simple to make and get up and part of me wants to be able to run tests against i seem to fathom how many tests one might have to write to test all the possible instruction combinations to ensure that the implementation is with the instruction set is but i help but think that as more instructions are your test code would grow more so than your typical tests at any about as newbie as you can get in terms of writing compilers and so my assumptions could very well be way off where do you even begin with testing on something like would one go about testing an interpreter or a

 been using castle windsor in my previous project and i liked it a for my current project looking to use a different ioc castle windsor had any new releases since 2007 and is still not at version so it is hard to justify using it in a commercial of the things i like about castle windsor is that you can have the container call an initialize method on your services after all dependencies have been set simply by making the service implement i used this a it makes it easy to do property injection instead of constructor injection and that cleans up code and tests quite a been looking at unity and as alternatives but of these only supports something it automatically calls an unfortunately does not really support the way i want to work with an ioc container injects based on string keys instead of interface declarations and therefore its autowiring support is limited i miss a similar feature in the ioc containers i looked is my way of working with ioc containers wrong or are there other ioc containers that do support something like iinitializable or other ioc containers have an iinitializable like

 believe your problem is that you use blocking sockets and not you use blocking sockets and you send 1m of data the network stack can wait for all of the data to be placed in a if the buffers are full be blocked and your progress bar will wait for the whole 1m to be accepted into the this may take a while and your progress bar will be however you use whatever buffer size you use will not and you will need to do the waiting yourself with is the most portable in this way your progress bar will be updated fast and reflect the most accurate note that at the sender the progress bar is partially broken any way since the kernel will buffer some data and you will reach before the other side really received the the only way around this is if your protocol includes a reply on the amount of data received by the others second guessing the os and the network is mostly if you keep using blocking sockets pick a size that is large enough to include more data than a single packet so that you send too little data in a packet as this will reduce your throughput go with something like 4k to include at least two packets at a

 best explanation is by try for all cars advertised on the web with engines smaller than litres that run and have an mp3 connection and can been seen in a showroom conveniently accessible by public transport from my just be able to help you with that not you have to make several searches and correlate the results on the semantic be able to express an interest in products for sale that are and add the every result would be one or more uis might enable you to do some may be others entirely other creating a chart of things not normally stored in one say the popularity of diet or country walks in a population versus the levels of clinical obesity in the same for these you may not use a web browser at but might use more like but the semantic web gives you tools for finding and manipulating the data that is out there and is accessible via the point made by bravax is not entirely not a lot may change you may merely get some more useful and better mashup web or you may find yourself doing a whole lot of stuff you never thought of as being related to the web before current web has lots of alternatives for doing the same say animated dhtml for putting data on the semantic web there will be a range of tools and rdfa is a good a more general type of but you could a of the whole expose a use a microformat or a proprietary html structure and a there will be many tools to suit different vartec is also partially you may use rdfa and erdf but you could also use a whole lot of other things for publishing that there is a lot over overlap between the semantic web and another simper concept called how they relate to each other but my perception of it is that the linked data web is what you need before semantic web tools and techniques have anything to linked data is about the semantic web is more about processing the reasoning over it and handling issues like trust reliability and such essentially the bottom few layers of technology

 best solution of them all would be to get the paging capablilities into your data access so that if you need page 3 you only get those ten records and not the entire that way you could also use a repeater to render the without having to extend it with paging capabilities just add another repeater at the bottom that loops out the page numbers as if this is not the easiest way would probably be to manually configure the gridview to render the way you want it to as close as been a while since i worked with a but the names i show below are at least close enough for you to find the correct ones with intellisense in your add a section betweeen the within that you should be able to specify each field you want to and the order you want them	
 best thing about scrum is exactly the fact that skills do get a bit the point is to avoid silos at all costs by spreading specialist knowledge across the team and letting people work a bit outside their comfort this is not for some developers are happy in their own narrow specialist field and such people are more of a hindrance in a scrum process than an whereas and people who are determined to get the job usually adapt very very well to it and are far more of the key benefits of scrum is to get the whole team actually involved and invested into the project instead of tackling their own special tasks and then riding off to the claim that for most this is a far more rewarding way of working than the conveyor belt of waterfall advise to boldly embrace the mixing of skills and having people come together to take down nasty problems instead of relying on specialist the result of teams consisting of motivated people can be	
 best thing is to parse the content as not as code execute the for json is a very easy way to assemble data from a server at a but you should never execute you should parse the data with a regular expression to confirm it is correct and only contains sql injection usually happens when you accept form data in the key would be to check for sql reserved words that cause a namely you could easily create a list of reserved words and run them through a regex expression probably has something nice or on the i am sure php could do this easily crud retrieve update and verbs are nice to look but forget about the server side sql stored procedures that already exist to do things or worse execute sql statements you could url encode the characters if you need to use them outside of a web page

 best way to achieve this will be to write a window service that acts like a mail client or this windows service should execute a timed action triggered by a which connects to the mail server and polls the server for any unread available in the email the email id to check for is the email id on which the users will give their input if the windows service client finds that there exists any new then it should download and filter the email body and push further for processing based on the user input in the you can host the input processing in the same windows service but it is not advisable to do the windows service can put the inputs in a special application directory or database from where your main appication can read the user inputs received in email and process them as will be required to develop a high performance client for doing i advise you not to use the default library due to performance instead use one of the best availabel open source implementations for like from we have used this in our applications and achieved remarkably grear this

 better or the answer is when the framework came out and tableadapters were included in the it became ridiculously easy to get your basic crud type or even a front page showing simply connect to your drag your and the structure was in including key need to perform updates on this use the specify your existing or let the wizard generate the procedures for hook that up to a gridview and you can quickly do lots of edit multiple records while and update in single or this kind of convenience is hard to pass up when working on projects that want to get done plus having things in this native format become convenient for xml shenanigans if that is what you need since the dataset model uses xml under the hood for a lot of will admit that i have not checked out the latest versions of the orms out and not sure if there is a wizard for linq that will do this much within a few and most people are a little slow to adapt newer technology as so it easy to see how it is still being used that new dynamic data service is built off of linq to sql or linq to i think the tide might finally change to the newer

 both object oriented languages for the jvm that have lambdas and closures and interoperate with other than extremely is a language in not only the sense that it is dynamically typed but that it supports dynamic is a language in that it is statically typed and has virtually no dynamic beyond the awkward stuff you can do in static type system is substantially more uniform and sophisticated than is syntactically influenced by java but semantically influenced more by languages like is syntactically influenced by both ruby and it is semantically influenced more by and a very obscure oo language called has multiple dispatch due to the way it handles java is single dispatch but has sml inspired pattern matching to deal with some of the same kinds of problems that multiple dispatch is meant to where multiple dispatch can only dispatch on runtime pattern matching can dispatch on runtime or pattern matching also includes syntactically pleasant variable hard to overstress how pleasant this single feature alone makes programming in scala and groovy support a form of multiple inheritance with mixins scala calls them supports both partial function application and currying at the language groovy has an awkward method for doing partial function does direct tail recursion i believe groovy important in functional programming but less important in imperative scala and groovy are eagerly evaluated by scala supports groovy does not must be emulated with has a generalization of list comprehensions found in other languages monad comprehensions plus a bit somewhere between do and has no concept of inner etc it uses singleton objects groovy uses the static does not have built in selection of arithmetic operators in quite the way that groovy in scala you can name methods very has the elvis operator for dealing with scala programmers prefer to use option types to using but easy to write an elvis operator in scala if you want there are there are damn and then there are the computer language benchmarks game ranks scala as being between substantially faster than groovy from twice to 93 times as while retaining roughly the same source sure there are many differences that i but hopefully this gives you a there a competition between of but not as much as you might real competition is jruby and going to my crystal ball is as cracked as anybody

 calculate the probability of collisions with strings of length with bits per character to a hash of length bits assuming an optimal you could calculate the collision probability based on a hash table of size of things first we can assume a ideal hashtable implementation that splits the bits in the hash perfectly into the available buckets this means becomes meaningless except as a limit for and are simply the basis for an upper bound for for simpler maths assume that strings length are simply padded to l with a special null if we were interested we are interested in the worst case this is plainly this is a ludicrous the actual number of entries is more useful than the character set and the length so we will simply work as if was a variable in own are left trying to put items into then becomes a very well known the this for various probabilities and number of buckets is but assuming we have 1 billion buckets about 4gb of memory in a 32 bit then we would need only 37k entries before we hit a chance of their being at least one given that trying to avoid collisions in a hashtable becomes plainly this does not mean that we should not about the behaviour of our hash clearly these numbers are assuming they are an upper bound on how good we can a poor hash function can give far worse collisions in some waste some of the possible by never or rarely using it all of which can cause hashes to be less than optimal and even degrade to a performance that looks like a list but with much constant implementation of the hash function is not great that it could be but is probably acceptable for the vast majority of users and is reasonably efficient to alternative perfect you wish you can generate what are known as this requires full knowledge of the input values in advance however so is not often in a simliar vein to the above maths we can show that even perfect hashing has the limit of of 54 strings of length however we only have bits shall assume which is about 4 billion different so if you can have truly string and any number of them then you have to l 2 solving log2 54 32 log2 54 string lengths clearly be you are left with a maximum length of just very short you know that you will only ever have a set of strings well below 4 billion in size then perfect hashing would let you handle any value of but restricting the set of values can be very hard in practice and you must know them all in advance or degrade to what amounts to a database of string hash and add to it as new strings are this exercise the universal hash is optimal as we wish to reduce the probability of collision for any input the probability of it having output x from a set of possibilities r is that doing an optimal job on the hashing the internal is quite hard but that you should expect the built in types to be reasonable if not always this example i have avoided the question of closed and open this does have some bearing on the probabilities involved but not

 can configure sites in iis to require a cert but that would generate an error if someone visiting with https and require all pages to use you could put a filter on iis that checks all requests and redirects them as https calls if they are on your encryption the obvious drawback here is the need to update your list of pages every time a new page is added from an xml file or and restart the think that you are probably correct in building code into the pages that require https that redirects to an https version if they arrive via as far as your cert error you could redirect with a full path includes the instead of a relative path to fix this if you have any questions about how to detect whether the call uses https or how to get the full path of the current request please let me both are pretty straightforward but got sample code if you need the certs that handle multiple subdomains are called wildcard the problem is that they are quite a bit more expensive than standard one other thing to consider is to use a master page or derived class for the pages that need that instead of duplicating the code in each page you can just declare it as type sslpage use the corresponding master and have the class handle the need to do some url processing if you take this approach but it is pretty

 can imagine a couple possible in and are both actually if you choose to provide custom allocation behavior for an object by overloading these you must be very careful in doing so to ensure you introduce some types of objects require that you overload to avoid memory management for if you have a reference counting smart pointer object the boost you must implement and you must be sure to do so consider this broken refcountedptr mdata return t implementation here is broken because it manage the reference counts on and it does not decrement the reference count on leading to a and it does not increment the reference count on leading to a possible memory fault down the road because the object being pointed to could be deleted before all the actual references are that if you do not explicitly declare your own for your the compiler will provide a default implementation which has behavior identical to the implementation shown here that completely broken for this particular as the article says in some cases you must overload and you must be careful to handle all situations i realize that the reference was an online rather than a even after reading the full article not clear what was but i think eckel was probably referring to situations like the second one i described

 case of integer overflows what is the result of or what type does the array index operator take for or something was auditing the following and suddenly this question the function has a vulnerability at line create a character array and initialize it with the size of this character array is specified by int unsigned int char char int if return buf if return for line return both and are very large unsigned the multiplication at line 9 have a chance to pass the the problem is at line multiply with int if the result is it is possible that the product is resulting in accessing a position that is before if the result is the product will always be resulting in accessing a position that is after hard to write code to justify is too does anyone has ideas on there any documentation that specifies the type of the i have searched for but so far found suppose that as far as the vulnerability is whether produces or because in the compiled object they are just the following code works the same no matter the type of the int x y x print x y in signed x print x y in unsigned it does not matter what type the multiplication it matters that whether the consumer function takes or question here is how bad the function or how to improve the function to make it the function undoubtedly has a the question is about the exact behavior of the based on the prescribed behavior from the case of integer overflows what is the result of unsigned or

 cdata section is for the purpose of allowing literal text that would normally be interpreted in a special way in an xml that something that looks like an entity or something that looks like xml anything in a cdata section can be inside valid xml without a cdata just need to use entity references to encode the various special characters so they be treated as xml but as character data that is the value of a the following is perfectly as long as it is what you the value of the element is the value which will not be interpreted by the xml parser as the entity reference for the copyright you can also do the this looks xml the value for the element this looks xml do this without a cdata this looks xml is much less but equivalent as far as an xml parser is if you did this that the element is defined an a schema or dtd as containing a string and not then your xml parser will this looks xml you use the cdata or entity escaping to protect the special characters from the xml parser so the client of the xml data can get the value of which happens to contain xml markup to be the above example is but if the schema or dtd says that the element contains or then it is an xml html or xhtml entities that are not defined as part of xml itself are not valid xml unless they are your xml parser will return an

 certainly but with many here are the top things to keep in mind already mentioned by some pointer in itself may imply that the resource ownership is passed to the called they must free it after a reference is in many situations the function you need to call is already defined and you change you must study its behavior and make sure it assume it will own the store it statically or copy it the function you are calling needs to take a to indicate the absence of said you will have no choice of using a calls are absolutely a of you block until they are done using your local object and then called function should never ever in any event access beyond the size of the object in this will destroy your stack and almost certainly crash your a function that is susceptible to accessing bytes beyond the size of the object may be a security in this is the most common method for breaking into secure this is called buffer the scope of your but you can read more and	
 certainly just bytes after and they can be of the deserialized object would contain only not any of the php if you want have to rewrite the behaviour as java classes that correspond directly with the php the main problem seems to be that the php serialization format does not seem to be formally specified at least there is no link to a specification in you might have to dig through the code to understand the in it sounds like it would be much easier and more stable to use something like xml serialization sure both languages have libraries that faciliate

 classes are fine as long as used in the right methods that are methods do not modify they merely transform the input good examples of this are things like these sorts of things are useful and make for terser i have with statics are if you have static dependencies are consider the static class public static void public static void public static void static class private static public static new graphicsformat in do something to create loading classes for all supported formats or some other contrived public static texture return how do we know that resourceloader is valid at this var texture return public static cleanup code at you cannot tell what initialisation steps must be carried out by looking at a you must delve into the class to find its dependencies and initialise things in the correct in this it needs the resourceloader to be initialised before now scale up this dependency nightmare and you can probably guess what will imagine trying to maintain code where there is no explicit order of contrast this with dependency injection with instances in that case the code even if the dependencies are not if you use statics that modify like a house of you never know who has access to and the design tends to resemble a spaghetti and just as using statics ties a program to a specific static code is the antithesis of designing for testing code that is riddled with statics is a a static call can never be swapped for a test double you use testing frameworks specifically designed to mock out static so a static system causes everything that uses it to be an instant integration statics are fine for some things and for small tools or throwaway code i discourage their beyond they are a bloody nightmare for good design and ease of a good article on the

 coached a lego team for a couple of years and we used the nxt the team consisted of 7th and 8th graders and they were readily able to learn learn the graphical programming environment and to develop some pretty sophisticated programs with as coaches we guided them in good software practices testing but the kids did the work and they learned a the standard nxt software is basically a stripped down version of and reasonably easy to use but a bit that was a good feature for the kids though they learned the hard way to save their work often because the software can and does crash while you want to have a blast playing with robots and especially if you want to involve kids this is a great environment for but the standard software is a graphical programming language so wiring up and configuring function blocks not writing code and some people consider that it all depends on what you want to we only used the standard nxt software with the kids because of fll contest you prefer using procedural languages the nxt is still a great platform for learning but need to switch to an alternative development environment like one of

 combine both whenever you make a tag tags should never so the presence of a tag is an indicator that you be trying to release anything else as the same when it came time to do put it onto a so the flow branch trunk to tag this new as and then bug fixes can be done on the branch avoid getting mixed up with any development that may already be on trunk and merged into each release of the fixed is tagged as from the this is basically the approach we use at work with and very similar indeed to through the i think virtually identical to far as the comment about tags being redundant because you have revision largely except that tags also specify a which files in the repository are covered by the you can reasonably ask someone to look at and they are immediately looking at a coherent if you ask them to look at revision they have to first look at revision x to see that it was changing and hence deduce that is what they should be looking what happens if revision x touched files in proj1 and which is of course but strictly speaking you should be saying and where is the list of revision numbers how do we know that is revision it should imho be possible to determine that just from the systems like tags and branches are still basically the same thing references to the object but the is that tag refs and branch refs do preferably with a specific constraint on how they perforce also has which are ways of grouping a set of file revisions together independently of a which is essentially a but more historically used changelist numbers to subversion revision qualified with the name of the branch they should be on to identify the two are almost identical any so here i guess

 comments on constructing where clauses in example is by definition going to be because putting single quotes where they and and produce this and and is obviously not going to the single quotes out and it should that never do it that never put the and in the substrings that are used to construct the where because what would i do if i have a value for the second string but not for the you have to concatenate a number of strings with a delimiter and some can be one thing to do is to just concatenate them all and not worry if the string before the concatenation is unassigned of concatenate 0 strwhere strwhere and 0 strwhere strwhere and 0 strwhere strwhere and all three strings are that would give and 5 and 123 and use to chop of the first 5 characters and it will always come out regardless of which of the variables have values none of them are get a which is what you if any one of them is first get and which is an erroneous leading which you just chop out with the this works because you know that all the results before the will start with and no matter what no needless tests for whether or not strwhere already has been assigned a value just stick the and in there and chop it off at the another someone mentioned sql in regards to there was a lengthy discussion of that which considers a lot of issues close to this sql

 const qualifier means that the methods can be called on any value of the difference comes when you consider calling a method on a const consider if your foobar type had the following extra method foobar const method is and can only be accessed from const v1 const v2 idea behind const though is to mark methods which will not alter the internal state of the this is a powerful concept but is not actually enforcable in more of a promise than a and one that is often broken and easily fbnonconst

 constructor is the method you want running before initialization but rather on but that should be the reason it work in your case is that you have undefined behavior you use the foo object to initialize itself the in exist you can solve it by creating an object cannot check for it in the but maybe valgrind could find this type of bug any other uninitialized memory	
 consume a different amount of power when executing this fluctuation of current acts like a rf transmitter and can be picked up by audio equipment and it will be essentially much like a am modulated as the execution usually does not produce a recognizable signal it sounds like white a good example of audio equippment picking up a rf signal is if you hold your cell phone close to an audio amplifier when receiving a you most likely will hear a characteristic pumping buzz from the cell here to learn more about there are multiple ways a signal can couple into your as you mentioned a power cord to be the source it was most likely magnetic inductive

 conversion operators are not part of the generated so they exist at the the complexity here would it be possible to use assembly rather than generated can you reference the original assembly for the this is supported both in the ide the advanced although it seems enabled by so might work already if you have a reference to the assembly with the message and via svcutil then you have your original conversions at the you want to keep the proxy you can add partial classes for each of your and add the extra conversion there but this has an obvious maintenance	
 convert characters to you need to specify a some character encodings use one byte per while others use two or more in for many there are far too many characters to encode with a single the simplest way to convert from characters to bytes is with the this method will silently replace characters with if the character cannot be mapped under the specified if you need more you can configure a to handle this case with an error or use a different replacement

 creating your own it makes sense to start them on first use and then let them hang around for a while in case you need them again you make an idle thread wait on an event so you can reactivate it by signaling the and after a long enough time the thread will wake itself and reclaiming the unused by keeping a small number of idle threads ready to be you reduce the overhead of constantly creating and destroying threads is significant for sufficiently this is basically what the thread queue already does for you so you may as well use a solved similar debate used to happen in the community about believe it or should we each write our own string or should we use the answer depends on whether you want to learn how to write a string or done with that and you want to get on with inventing something

 currently in the middle of porting a fairly large perl the problem is that it uses little perl tricks to make its code available for done about the same with making the codebase one big module for had a firm grasp of python for a long but i have no experience with large projects written in python that need to access other parts of itself while maintaining an internal yet tried simply importing the entire thing in one line but i know currently not doing things in the best of an example from the master script that sets everything in but not happy with right the master class script imports each piece of the module and creates an instance of the contained passing itself as an argument to in those like def the code in that class can access the entire rest of the codebase through the parent my question is considering the what would be the best way to reorganize the project and refactor the code so that it retains its current ability to access everything the code is very so not worried about internal data i just like having to go through the parent class in such an ugly and those long chains slow the code down as forgot links to the svn repos for both mine is and the project porting is a large python project that must share an internal

 currently writing a custom server control in my idea is to create some sort of collapsible panel control the first server control so what i wanted to have is that the user defines my control in this way in the control should then render on the final page as submit button has then an on the control which the panel first approach was to create a server control that inherits from inside the collapsiblepanel control i then created another panel in the oninit i did something like the override void for i i control control basically took all the controls which are currently present inside my control and add them to the control list of the internally created panel furthermore i added the button which then does the of then problem is that somehow the rendering work the button and the pnlcontent are rendered out just the controls inside the pnlcontent are not the output is like the pnlcontent is someone suggest me a solution for this what i did wrong with the i override the default rendering of the panel i inherit since i thought this be necessary because i modify its control structure in the so it should render out my the moment i found a i basically did it the same way it is most often done in the microsoft ajax control i created a socalled which render itself but just adds so now i add the the id of the panel to collapse to my collapsiblepanelextender control and it does then the job of maybe also the better and cleaner solution but i still would like to know what went wrong in my first approach i described for any server controls

 decide if 1 or 2 is fix for strange if return ugly if return elseif return elseif return elseif return elseif return elseif return elseif return elseif return else nothing so both are just return one of return step is the absolutley best solution foreach as if take it and ignore the return step no best prepare image widths so we have to get them more than foreach as step filter based on the index is because we have an array of arrays return should work test but it is does it we look for the absolutely best in this because looking for a substrings is inexpensive we find a image we have to analyze the image widths so we calls a filtering function that takes 2 array values and replaces those two by the one return by the function better this is repeated until there is only one value left in the solution is still because comparisons if are done more than my notation skills are a bit but i think soulmerges solution is the better one could still improve soulmerges because the second loop is not pack it into a function so you have return as a if the first strstr return the value and ignore the you have to store the score for every array just compare to the highestkey variable and if the new value is store foreach as if return else if 260 elseif 265 elseif 600 elseif 220 elseif the loser return should work in imagine a more efficient way	
 decided that there is no guaranteed way to do the solution that i present below works for english version but fails when compiling with japanese version vc2003 perhaps it is japanese in any it cannot be depended on to note that even declaring everything as strings work is painful in gcc as described i believe that you just need to bite the bullet and move all text into a data file and load it from i am now storing and accessing the text in ini files via at least there is a guarantee that it works as all text is out of the answering this myself since only evan appeared to understand the the answers regarding what unicode is and how to use are not relevant for this problem as this is not about nor a misunderstanding of character i appreciate your attempt to help apologies if i clear problem is that i have source files that need to be under a variety of platforms and the program does it care about any other i want to have string literals in like currently works with gcc and how do i do it with backward compatible is what i have literals are used as is encoded source files must not have a literals are used as is encoded source files may or may not have a bom literals are massaged by the compiler raw string literals are to a specified is not supported as a target files must have a the simple answer is that for this particular is broken and does not supply a backward compatible compile the only way to get unicode strings into the compiled program is via bom wchar which means that i need to convert all strings back to at time of any simple method of converting wchar to for what size and encoding is the wchar on on other it see the for some the end i decided that i will avoid the conversion cost on all compilers other than with source like the visual 2005 and later require the source files in and all strings to be encoded as otherwise the strings will be converted into the local multibyte encoding and cause to use a as these strings then need to be convert back to this function is just a rough example of how to do define char static char return visual 2003 and gcc will use the string literals as so the files should be saved as gcc requires the files to not have a define that this code is just a simplified production use would need to clean it up in a variety of ways error buffer size is used like the following it compiles cleanly and works correctly in my tests on and

 developers should work in sandboxes if no builds should not all be public by tdd will lead to multiple failures and refinements to both tests and sharing builds publically may be bothersome but certainly other developers should be able to see what someone is up to if they cared enough to go and they should be made public when asked to do if you are asking for proof that they tested something the running their unit tests after they check the code in should be proof developers the and freedom to test changes liberaly will improve the stability and quality of your testing theories and trouble shooting often require small incremental if the sandbox is expensive they should be required to reserve time for using giving each developer a private sandbox could result in their code branching for long periods of what is your motivation in asking if the developer is trying to hide something then get to the root cause of that if you are trying to control costs then consider the reservation

 do not agree with the current accepted foremost important aspect of multicore machines is that and main memory are far this means that unless the application is or easy to it is highly likely that it would be memory rather than cpu floating point multiplication takes about 4 clock while a memory fetch from main memory takes hundreds of clock exploiting cache locality becomes if the achieved performance on single core is sufficient of the applications would belong the this there is no need to but if it is not your application is much more responsive since they then you would do better to refactor your application to better exploit parallelism and cache the refactored application would consist of relatively independent less which run in parallel for for a good overview on multicore and the way things are the major points they say speed is not increasing anymore as it is more cost effective to manufacture more number of simpler than a small number of fast memory is far from a few there will be of in web 100s on so plan to scale your application to 100s or 1000s of this means you should create several independent are difficult to work therefore work with

 do not need to worry so much about stack especially for a single you declare a variable on the nothing says that the compiler has to actually create space for it unless you take its even if the compiler can show that the address or if the compiler can see all the uses of that address the function calls that get passed the address are all then it still have to actually create space for the case i can see for using the reference instead of a copy is if the value is changed through the other perhaps in a function then the reference value will change with a copy it	
 do not really agree to types in allow variable in question to actually dbnull is a way to say another this value considered to be since we a way do differentiate actually null or in native to our current runtime null in another system we nullable types and dbnull completely different distinction is only required if you do not know if your local variable has allready been fetched from the if you know that the variable has been fetched from the database it would be okay to identify null and the difference is that null in programming languages signals the absence of a value and null null is in databases the null indicates something more like an unknown therefore null null is false in null equals nothing at all because you cannot tell for an unknown value if it equals another unknown i am not sure if dbnull is implemented this way and evaluates to just tested it and dbnull does not behave as evaluates to true but should yield false with the semantic of the database

 do you empty a vase containing five if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing four do you empty a vase containing four if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing three do you empty a vase containing three if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing two do you empty a vase containing two if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing one do you empty a vase containing one if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing no do you empty a vase containing no if the vase is not you take out one but the vase is empty so generalize do you empty a vase containing if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing can we see that in int flowersinvase flowersinvase 0 take one flower flowersinvase 1 else the vase is nothing to we have just done that in a for recursion can be replaced with but often recursion is more talk about in computer a is a structure made up of where each node has some number of children that are also or a is a tree made of nodes that have exactly typically called and again the children can be or a is a node that is not the child of any other that a in addition to its has a a and imagine that we wish to sum all the values in some sum value in any one we would add the value of node itself to the value of its left if and the value of its right if now recall that the if not are also to sum the left we would add the value of child node itself to the value of its left if and the value of its right if to sum the value of the left left we would add the value of child node itself to the value of its left if and the value of its right if anticipated where going with and would like to see some node int root if there is no its sum is root null return 0 else there is a return that instead of explicitly testing the children to see if null or we just make the recursive function return zero for a null say we have a tree that looks like this numbers are the slashes point to and means the pointer points to 4 2 1 we call sumnode on the root node with value we will 5 expand that in everywhere we see replace it with the expansion of the return 5 5 4 5 4 2 null 5 4 2 0 5 4 2 0 1 null 5 4 2 0 1 0 5 4 2 0 1 0 3 null 5 4 2 0 1 0 3 0 0 5 4 2 0 1 0 3 5 4 2 0 1 3 5 4 2 1 3 5 4 3 5 3 5 10 15 see how we conquered a structure of arbitrary depth and by considering it as the repeated application of a composite each time through our sumnode we dealt with only a single using a singe and two simple return statements that almost wrote directly from our to sum a if a node is null its sum is otherwise its sum is its value plus the sum of its left child plus the sum of its right child the power of vase example above is an example of all that means is that in the recursive if we recursed if we called the function that was the last thing we tree example was not tail because even though that last thing we did was to recurse the right before we did that we recursed the left the order in which we called the and added the current value matter at because addition is look at an operation where order does use a binary tree of but this time the value held will be a not a tree will have a special that for any its character comes alphabetical the character held by its left child and alphabetical the character held by its right we want to do is print the tree is alphabetical easy to given the tree special we just print the left then the then right just want to print so pass our function something to print this will be an object with a char we need to worry about how it just that when print is print see that in node char worry about this printer private o void char c out worry about this printer if there is no do root null return else there is a printer value printer root this function returns a printer addition to the order of operations now this example illustrates that we can pass things into a recursive the only thing we have to do is make sure that on each recursive we continue to pass it we passed in a node pointer and a printer to the and on each recursive we passed them if our tree looks like h a j will we we go left where we go left where we go left to where we do nothing and we return to where we print and then go right where we do nothing and we return to a and are we return to where we print and then go right where we go left where we go left to where we do nothing and we return to where we print and then go right where we do nothing and we return to i and are we return to where we print and then go right where we do nothing and we return to j and are we return to h and are return to where we print and then go right n where we go left to where we do nothing and we return to where we print and then go right where we do nothing and we return to n and are so return to k and are so we return to the if we just look at the lines were we we return to where we print and then go right we return to where we print and then go right we return to where we print and then go right we return to where we print and then go right return to where we print and then go right we return to where we print and then go right see we printed which is indeed in alphabetical manage to print an entire in alphabetical just by knowing how to print a single node in alphabetical which was just our tree had the special property of ordering values to the left of alphabetically later knowing to print the left child before printing the and tto print the right child after printing the the power of being able to do whole things by knowing only how to do a part of the whole knowing when to stop that in most operator when its first operand is the general recursive function m

 driving ui is problematic because you often know what you want on the screen until you see it on the for that gui development tends to be massively iterative and therefore very difficult to drive with does not mean that we just abandon tdd for we push as much code as we possibly can out of the leaving behind only simple wiring that wiring allows us to make the massively iterative changes we without affecting the essence of the technique was probably best described by michael feathers some years ago in an article entitled humble dialog it is also the fundamental idea behind the pattern that caused such a stir four years and has now been split into the passive view and supervising controller the article link in this question takes advantage of these but in a rather than a idea is to test drive everything except the we even need to write the view for a good long the view is so absurdly simple that it probably need any kind of unit tests at or if it they can in fact be written test drive the supervising controller you simply make sure you understand how the data will be presented on the you need to know where the data or what the font or what color it or any of the other cosmetic issues that cause the massive iteration of you know one data item will be some kind of text another will be a still another will be a button or a check and then you make sure that the view can ask all the questions it needs to ask to get these items rendered example the text box may have a default the view should be able to ask for the menu may have some items the view should be able to ask for this the questions that the view asks are all about and are devoid of business the same the view will tell the supervising controller when anything the controller will modify the data including any kind of validation and error and then the view can ask how that data should be of this can be test driven because all decoupled from the visual all about the data is manipulated and and about what it looks so it need to be massively	
 dumps are exactly that dumps of the mysql database contents as there any way to read this directly as a database you can is modify your init script for mysql to automatically load the last dump the command every time mysql even better solution would be to use a ramdisk to hold the entire contents of your database in and then periodically copy this to a safe location as your if you want to maintain the contents of your databases at better off just using one of the storage engines or and just giving your server a lot of ram to use as a

 dynamic your executable has a special place for all external calls your executable has a list of libraries it depends two things are it is impossible to say which external function lives in which a program does an external function what actually happens it calls an entry in the plt which does a jump into the dynamic the dynamic loader looks which function was called looks its name symbol table in the and looks up that name in all libraries that are mapped that given executable is dependant once the name is the address of the corresponding function is written back to the so next time the call is made directly bypassing the dynamic answer your you should do the same job as dynamic linker get a list of dependent and lookup all names in this could be done using or for static i think all symbols in given object file within get linked for static library consists of object files and if you need a function and it resides in then will be linked to your app together with function and all other data defined in this is the reason why for example c library functions are split per

 ended up having to write my own assembly the basics of how it in order to help others if they need to implement their own assembly cache is a folder with a corresponding wrapper class in the method to install an assembly in the cache returns a string name under which the assembly is which the caller can save and use to retrieve the assembly method to retrieve an assembly takes the token and returns an object which encapsulates the cached installing an first compare an incoming bits to the bits of each of the already cached assemblies and determine if the assembly is already installed all the bits are the they must obviously do the same if the assembly is already then return the name of the previously cached if it is not already allow multiple versions to be installed by finding an available variant of the assembly name in the cache folder assembly assembly cache the assembly in the and return its cached name to the far a security and strong naming it does not make sense in my application to do strong name as it would be what bruce payette calls gnome security countermeasure which an attacker could merely walk if an attacker decided to poison an he would also have access to the location where the strong name would be stored and could easily change it to his strong it ends up being the responsibility to use assemblies only from sources he if the user installs a malicious it is his not to provide a little more protection for the the use of external assemblies in my application will disabled by for other it might make sense to implement strong name verification as an extra layer of

 error is never as as examples error codes for program if you have an error that is do not throw an reading a you may throw an exception for not but never throw one for of you you can never write simple always wrapping code in exception and forget exceptions are very this is especially important in big so important at all in your desktop be very careful with exception you may think ok to have an then derive a from then for your smtp but unless you hold generic data in the base you will always have to catch every type of exception in that if you put the reason for the smtp error in your you must catch it if you only catch you will not have access to the a good workaround for this problem is to have a string and an int member in the base exception class and only use even for the derived unfortunately only offers a string people say that doing this means you might as well only have a single exception especially as you will always catch the base class type you do use exceptions you must take the trouble to populate them with more data than you would with an error with you must handle them immediately or they get lost in the with an it may get caught many levels away from where it was thrown like in is and gets an exception 2 levels in from unless you specify the error to be specific to the code in you may think it was thrown from the but seen code where an exception was handled many levels down the call it was a to this especially applies to oo given you enough to think the simple truth of the matter is that style means nothing in error practicality is if you have to put log statements everywhere an error can then do it matters a lot more that you can see where the code went wrong what data was being worked than you have a elegant exception hierarchy or littered your code with exception you cannot easily trace the your error handling code is are use but think about what do not misuse or overuse a misused exception is worse than no error handling at all you can grab a crash dump and view the unhandled exception to find the error in with an exception that is eaten and found over the years that the biggest assistant to debugging is write write lots of

 every answer has to avoid the declare the function before its and as chris points use the standard mechanisms for accessing the variadic arguments or suffer the pains of undefined this it is not that the declaration before use in this case is required because of the return but rather because it does not match the default signature for an undeclared that a function taking unspecified arguments returning an the actual definition is different from the assumed declaration which causes gcc to say types for second example return because the later definition of contradict the default signature assumed when its first call was but just because it works make it good form because you get almost no type safety from the default to the variadic arguments ones matching the really should be done through the standard mechanisms of unless you are implementing a compiler and are the author of that for on some architectures those arguments may not even be passed on the but they can still be located by the macros from i reworded the second paragraph to say what i meant in a and i hope compiler needs to know that the function is variadic the first call because on some it might be required to pass the variadic parameters differently than normal that is especially true of certain risk and those that might pass the first 2 ints and first 2 floats in but must put all variadics on the stack even if there is room in the similar declare before use situation exists for functions that do not use the calling you will usually run into this when linking modules written in pascal or fortran with modules written in many of the windows api functions exported by the core dlls assume a calling convention named and if the compiler were to use a style the program would crash the whole machine on windows 9x or

 excuse my i only started coding in silverlight tried implementing the command pattern in silverlight and hit a say commands are because you can write them into so you can keep your also you have loose coupling between your view and your viewmodel because there is no direct reference to the viewmodel in the can not keep your because you can bind only one command to a and you have to decide which event will fire your command when you bind if a control has 30 you have to choose one for the other 29 will execute the other commands from event handlers from the code coupling can be achieved more simply by dependency commands add a useless layer of indirection that gives nothing they only make it a bit harder to maintain your it is easier to maintain your when you are programming against an interface and see exactly what method gets then when you have to keep jumping between your command definitions and your i miss or commands are really not meant to be used for view and viewmodel see the following this is why i get all the hype with wpf and silverlight command implementations useless for the

 experience is that in situations where you need a of the and types of fields are so flexible and likely to change throughout the lifetime of your project that you would likely need some sort of map instead of example have an attribute map from keys to public calls for getting and setting the but let everybody use them make sure they create classes to represent each attribute you are interested and that class provides all the functions for manipulating that for if you have you could have a class that is initialized to a specific player and then provides setters with appropriate validation and and perhaps things like calculating strength with advantage of this is that you decouple the use of your attributes from your player so if you now add an intelligence you have to deal and recompile everything that manipulates only for accessing fields a bad when you access a field in vb least in old you usually call a property getter and setter and vb simply hides the call for my view is that you have to adapt to the conventions of the language that you are in java and the like you have fields and you have calling a method should always have the to make it clear that it is a call and other things may happen you could get an either one of the benefits of java is its more precise syntax and to java or is like texting to graduate school scientific some usability research shows that better to not have parameters to constructors and rather construct and call all the setters if you need

 first should not the static variable requires a constant second sets each time the function is so there was no need to make it in the first the first notation was correct initialized to say then it would be initialized once when the program starts and would thereafter only take new values when the code changed the second notation still sets on each call to the and so renders the use of if you try hard you can devise scenarios under which the second version has a use for for if the function returns a pointer to it that other code then then it might be but that is esoteric in the extreme and would be a pretty bad

 following comment on my regex solution incite my to perform a this a situation where regex is a little overly a straight solution would be simpler and more i response was the i decided for regex because you get all cases covered your regex is if you do it with and get a simpler solution if the input is but catching all invalid using string methods might really become when i start parsing a number decimal i already know that it is a valid number and will not think of inputs like you will split them but crash quite sure or return a meaningless in code accessing will out of bounds for the input parsing may and there are sure a few more uncatched catching them all will probably the code more unreadable than the regex i decided to use microsofts awesome tool and analyse my regex approach and string opertion i left code unmodified and replaced the console output in my solution with statements that build the result as just like david make a quite complete analysis i constraint pex to generate only inputs shorter than 45 characters and use only the following 9 different is no need to use all because they behave all the i included 9 to make it easy to discover the overflow but 0 and 1 schould also be sufficent pex would probaly find 1000 instead of i included 0 and 1 to discover an error with very tiny numbers like but nothing i assume very small numbers are silently rounded to zero but i did not investigate this or may be 44 because of the precision of decimal of 28 to 29 digits plus some room for other characters were just to short to generate a small enough the other characters are because they are the other valid characters in the finally i included the exclamation mark as surrogate for invalid result of the analysis proved me pex found two bugs in my i do not check for null input skipped that intentionaly to concentrate on the important causing the well known nullreferenceexception and pex discovered that the input causes to fail with an also reports some false negative for example was reported as an input causing a reruning the generated test yields no it turns out that caused the test to fail during looking at other failed tests reveals that fails for inputs starting with a decimal point during the but they are valid numbers and do not fail during normal i am unable to explain this false here is the result for one run of pex against the string operation both implementation share the missing null check and the overflow but the simple string operation solution is unable to handle many malformed they almost all result in a but pex discovered also the indexoutofrangeexception i question is how hard would it be to handle all this the simple solution would be to guard the parsing instruction with i am not sure if this is sufficent to guarantee correct operation on the well formed part of the but may this is not required and a malformed input should cause an empty what would make it to fix the here are the code coverage results that i analysed the regex solution using decimal and single because pex was unable to instrument one method used inside for me a regex solution should really be they are somewhat harder to design and but they handle malformed inputs much robuster than a simple string operation based and just not to forget i did not checke if the results returned are at this is another

 format specifier is in the system which seems to always be macroman and not so it can only display characters in macroman your best option with nslog is just to use the native object format specifier and pass the nsstring directly instead of converting it to a c if you only have a c string and you want to use nslog to display a message instead of printf or you will have to do something like don suggests in order to convert the string to an nsstring object all of these should display the expected char you do decide to use note that while it accepts strings in utf8 format and passes the correct encoding to the syslog daemon it will show up properly in the it encodes the string for visual encoding when displaying to the terminal or logging to a file so values will be displayed as escaped character

 general terms the algorithm for calculating a leap year is as year will be a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by if a year is divisible by 4 and by it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by years such as 1988 and so on are leap years because they are divisible by 4 but not by for century the 400 rule is century years 1800 and 1700 while all still divisible by 4 are also exactly divisible by as they are not further divisible by they are not leap	
 generalized format of a for loop a first is used to initialize the loop is the looping and is an increment or decrement but there are no rules that say they have to behave like equivalent to the following while commas are just an operator that combines two expressions into a single whose value is the second they are used in the for loop because each part by needs to be a single not multiple really no reason maybe to save some space in the to write a for loop like that since this is var for i i j x return

 generation can fill that gap really i started using but then they made that a pay item so i moved to my approach is to attack the db code gen the mapping and gen classes if they already that gets something going really great for a prototype and creating test mapping classes and db are often then changed by in some instances tried getting the code generation to work as part of ci but proven hard to do unless disciplined about where you part hand crafted code partial classes were a but still a prob to get the whole team on the same likes to have their code overwritten by a even if you can then rollback and	
 generation is a good thing when done but is far too frequently done code generators must be smart enough to handle changes to the generated back in the even the shiny new visual studio code generators could do that within with we got partial classes to make it even more there are still some generators out there that are quite incapable of working more than rules for code code should be generated within the ide for which the code is no typically this is a visual studio but this rule applies to other languages as code generated should provide clear and easy extension code generated should be otherwise invisible to the other the developer should only use the designer to modify generated

 generator can save you some valuable but please keep in mind if you start to generate huge amounts of that also means your code is not meaning a lot of this could introduce problems for code and degrade the elegance of your you find yourself generating a lot repeated blocks of code or similar try to find a better such as class factories runtime code it takes longer to but more fun and more makes maintenance easier as if you have the freedom to choose your you could try activerecord rails or or they are all excellent orms that requires minimum

 give them the true reasons i was in a company i actually wanted to work that rather than having been enslaved by usually this is get my job done faster if i have and my time is worth a lot to being more if the question do situations arise where you want to pay for the software in question the core competence out of which the company makes its in the case of then the same thing but with instead of and its instead of its so going to get a package the question is whether to get the expensive which no good free option or where the expensive software is better than the free due to better lower tco account of not having to fix the bugs or the package just a hosted and the cost to the organisation of training someone to install the service and keeping a whole person to maintain it would be even more than the this is another part of but it applies even if the software itself costs the same either the first point is that games companies be writing their own web app companies be writing their own banking software departments be writing office unless you really think that better off doing that than writing or web or trading or whatever you have actual deadlines obviously there are some if you want a tiny little script or webapp it may be easier just to write it than to find something off the shelf that does what you the second means different things to different assuming equal if your department is full of linux geeks then the free option probably has more than if you have no linux and also need an sla on the package in if the is going to be compiled into your as opposed to just supporting your then obviously software is useless to you whereas would probably be and so

 handling is a paradigm by it normally be included in examples since it seriously corrupts the point that the author tries to come across the author wants to pass knowledge about error handling in a specific domain or language then i would prefer as a reader to have a different chapter that outlines all the dominant paradigms of error handling and how this affects the rest of the	
 handling logic is still plenty useful in the web domain when used in the right your code may need to connect to a communicate with a different or call your own in any of these want to catch an exception and communicate that to the say you need to communicate with a database that is want to send that information back to the client page to inform the user your site is currently down or experiencing unless all of your external calls return friendly status codes is highly unlikely and need to rely on

 have a problem with i think i understand what the issue but i test that understanding and ask if anyone has seen this before or can workaround or an alternate please bear with this is a which is difficult to break down to a minimal test writing a interface to a legacy messaging i have the interop assembly for a direct interface and that all works of it is that i have a class for each message and a generic passing around that just occupies the same space as a maximal size message class implements cast operators to cast into and out of called the generic class and the individual are both derived from a bodyless minimal message a client to send a message just calls a send method in an interface assembly a casting into the generic type for the receiver event the receiving app a generic which be cast according to a common which has a relationship with the message have implemented the local direct interface and this all works i can now message between the test application and existing native the basic class structure looks like class a message class generic message defines an empty class some irrelevant cast operators to convert to and from the abstract message public static implicit operator some irrelevant public static implicit operator some irrelevant the cast comes the i want to extend this interface to support group of developers overseas can communicate via wcf with an service i have this is with an admirable lack the the exposes for test purposes method which takes a string and converts this into a message legacy this also works with a call to the function in my application being converted into a legacy message and sent to i tried to extend the interface to add an entrypoint which would accept a in the hope that this would work the same way as the direct the sender would cast their message into a sending function with this and the adapter would simply pass generic message into its local interface assembly for so the wcf code would look pretty much exactly like the normal messaging interface void dialout void dispatch i extended the client and the proxy code for the wcf client the client seems that the client app cannot understand the cast and throws a even if i include the messaging assembly with the code above a the client code the type defined in the generated and ignores the original message so it cannot the cast this is the type in with the imported type in using the type defined in far as i can the class defined in the generated proxy is of course the generated proxy class only defines data not contains two partial class whole slew of data partial class extra stuff to define the added can leave the assembly reference so the code see the cast and fails or i can leave the reference in and the compiler wilfully ignores type definition and uses the proxy and fails to other wcf developers seen this kind of thing or does everyone simple value parameters when calling wcf am i just going to have to an endpoint with a unique class parameter for every kind of message want to this is a maintenance type

 have had a few development managers who seem to understand or appreciate the difficulties of software design and managers believe that processes and methodologies completely solve the problem and i have a tough time explaining to them that it is not so and that you cannot read a book on the latest process fad and hope to get results by applying them as latest frustration i have is to convince my manager to give me requirements not but a larger set as far as give my team lead time to think about how to thrash out a few work out an implementation to plan out the tasks frustrations are compounded because of agile methodology and the interpretation of it that says not to do design against big design in product owner can change requirements at any time and so far i had much success and have to put up with the resulting you give me some arguments that can convince such are though not always at the end of every and the problems are brought but as i my manager appreciate the need for design lead time and the frustrations with have a problem with changing i understand that it will be but imagine you want a small feature to begin with and then you keep adding more around after a few the design cannot handle it anymore and a redesign is this could have been solved better with an upfront design in the first had the related features been investigated its not its the natural way of doing it i call software engineering common manager understand why i ask for time to redesign few times i just call it refactoring so that it fits the agile way of doing but it really is and not developing and demoing new to educate a development manager about the difficulties of software

 having some trouble with understanding how iis is handling static variables on its my understanding has always been that if iis has 4 worker processes that it can handle 4 requests simultaneously and that it would be the same as having 4 separate threads running the any static variables would persist in each individual the reason a bit confused is that i have a scope that made which manages connections and caching when testing the app i notice any issues but after compiled it and hit it at the same time from two different locations i seem to get a sort of now if these worker processes are separate why would this can more than one request be processed on a single worker thread at the same this is tremendously important as there are unique that are held in these static members to handle escalation of the objects that manage these functions and it appears that they are trying to access the same running this on iis server on an x64 values that need to persist through the thread on a single i put these values into which seems to do the can be used but it may not be available during the entirity of the request in one module that i is only used on a variable to indicate if that thread has already loaded the settings for the cahcing if true then the tread is ready to fetch data from the caching do i prevent static member variables from being accessed by more than one request at a time in

 humbly suggest that on some compilers on certain architectures the following could reduce more effectively than constant get many of the comments have a compiler will do a good job of optimizing a loop for you optimization people have spent lots and lots of time thinking about legible code is probably more but you really want to optimize beyond what you think a compiler may be able to i suggest looking at the assembly that the high level language and consider further optimizations from a high you may also be able to get significantly greater performance by using openmp or on a lower level by way of a vector instruction set to do multiple computations in a single a bit beyond the scope of the and have to give a lot more information about what the doing for useful advice on that helps

 i am hoping someone can help me to understand why i am getting varied results with some php code i have written to upload files to s3 then call an ec2 instance to perform actions on the uploaded is the order i do things use s3 class to put file s3 check made it to use curl to call ec2 instance and perform action on file in am using this with video when i upload a small video file it works ok but for larger video the code doesnt seem to get past step the file is moved to s3 ok but my guess is that after a while php gives up waiting to see if 1 and so does not execute the rest of the is the best way to handle something like how can i detect that the file has been uploaded to s3 and then run some code when it to sequence events in php for uploading files to amazon

 i came up with a good the user successfully logs we create an additional session cookie that expire until the browser is the user comes back to the login page later and the request is we check for the existence of the session cookie if it we know that the user has previously had a so we explicitly log them exactly as we do for the if the session cookie exist then we attempt to automatically log the user in using their custom session cookie is deleted for each explicit log and for each successful gives us the best experience for the and guarantees that a certificate will be cached only as long as a session is still valid the session cookie cannot be removed by the user so there is no way to bypass this they use the site without accepting session cookies

 i clicked on this question thing it read to write but now i ought to take a wonder if taking a leaf from the agile book might work in short iterations to four and ensure that you deploy no less than at the end of every that you are driven to get really good at deploying your app if it takes too long you get anything else problems with the deployed app feed back from the user community as they are encountered and can be prioritised for action over subsequent	
 i completely agree with the answer that pick the cleanest and optimize if it becomes a another way to look at it is that the fastest solution is the one that describes your intent most in this foreach says that like to apply some action for each element in the plain for loop say that like a counter you want to repeatedly add one to this value and as long as it is less than the number of elements in the you would like to perform some other the plain for loop overspecifies the it adds a lot of requirements that actually part of what trying to you about the loop but as soon as you write a for it has to be the other the qt people have made no additional promises that may affect they simply guarantee to iterate through the container and apply an action to other often the cleanest and most elegant solution is also the	
 i consider that bad practice as a hard and fast though assuming that this is for some kind of instance tracking or resource if just remember that there will have to be logic behind the scenes to ensure that objects that would otherwise be out of scope stick around in your static collection not sure which language but if you could consider storing it internally as a

 i create an abstract property in my base and then a subclass implements is it possible to then reference and use that property in one of my base methods later on once the subclass sets that want to sort of pass a value from my subclass to base class so that in my base class i can perform some logic using it in that base class even not a property but an field i would need to require that field to be set in a subclass if the think even i really need a property if i can set some sort of flag in my subclass via an abstract field so that the base class can use that flag for some logic that my subclass is going to depend on such as sending an i want to be able to set a flag in any subclasses using this base to say true or false so that the base sendrequest method knows whether to chose from a couple of uris that i have set in my base that flag will determine which format to use in the base sendrequest method since each subclass will vary in terms of what uri format the base class should use for that subclass in order to send the httprequest on behalf of the to use abstract property value in a base

 i did not know that actionscript used the word in that are two separate concepts at work inheritance and the term is used in both cases in and many other a class which inherits from another refers to that class as its while many people use the term in fact you could quite legitimately use the word as the names this is object on the other is what described with the example of the car and a car is composed of several other one or more of which is the i must not often heard the term used in this context to refer to the probably find most people in the world would recognize the by the label in the case of a data structure like an xml we often talk about parent nodes and child the parent contains the so using the word in a composition relationship is also apposite depending on the type of i think find many programmers using the word in composition scenarios outside of a tree distinction is often likened to a versus identity versus in the child subtype of its in on the other the car or a parent node in a tree collection of child kendall below added some good comments on the part of your question related to instances and passing if you have a particular block of code and a specific error please feel free to update your question with them and try to

 i have a simple pathfinding algorithm which precalculates the shortest route to several target each of which has a different this is somewhat equivalent to having one endpoint with a node between it and each though the edges there have different the algorithm it uses is a simple spreading which in 1d looks this this means means 3 2 4 3 2 2 handled distance 5 4 3 3 2 2 handled distance 4 4 3 2 3 2 2 handled distance 3 4 3 2 3 1 2 1 1 2 handled distance 2 any remaining rooms are suppose i have a precalculated pathfinding solution like this where only the 5 is a 5 4 3 2 1 i change the wall to a recomputing is just all distance nodes ignore the ones which already i am not able to figure out an efficient way to handle what to do if the 4 became a clearly the result is 5 in a 2d solution not sure how to efficiently deal with it is easily possible to store that 4 depends on 5 and thus needs but how do i determine its new dependency and values rather avoid recalculating the entire which is better than is to only recalculate array elements with a manhattan distance of 5 from the and to maintain source would basically mean reapplying the algorithm to a selected area but can i do how to handle changing weights

 i have a very odd using php part of though this also happens on a lamp server running as writing a web site using zend framework the software writing does a rather complicated statistical calculation that requires a lot of usually it runs fine with 128mb set as the memory the fun have a class which is exclusively responsible for getting the data it needs doing the calculations then returning the after it i have been unsetting as php seems to think that still in scope and holding up the memory for despite finishing the function in which it is called was causing problems where the second run of the calculation was hitting the memory limit and the script after this calculation is run once inside that it is run again in another function to do another calculation is during the same run of where things get i run that second the calling function runs despite the fact that there are absolutely no calls to that function from within the code which does this no errors or warnings appear in if i increase the memory limit to 1024 the overall calling function runs once and continues along its merry let me draw a map calls function calls function calls calculation function calls calculation function 128 mb of path of functions is as follows and back to the it runs a from the start of the for some to the end a conditional case which becomes true during this execution so the path 1gb of path of functions is as of which is what is supposed to i remove the second calculation from function it if i up the memory it have i found a bug in php memory or perhaps in the zend by increasing the memory limit per script in i see this or remove the second instance of running this calculation which uses a lot of very sure this is the way it despite the oddness of the way it does never seen this kind of jumping back to the start of a calling usually what would happen in this case is that php would error out and not restart the calling reaching memory limit causes function to

 i have the library you wish for it may be out there somewhere and would be but this may one of the interesting concepts the school of unit testing thought has come up with is the idea of an in some there seems to be as much value in taking the calls an object makes to the entire universe of things outside of and turning them into an as there is in the typical act of making an interface for methods the outside world can call your this you might instead of mocking the entire file making one or more logically coherent interfaces for the answers and services your object needs from the outside the calls would merely answer the questions you need answered not dictate you can use dependency injection as you mentioned to inject in the implementation you desire for your and probably use moq to do so since familiar with your might have a method called it might accept a if there is a business question your object is trying to and seeing if a file exists is merely the that question is then your outgoing interface might not have a method about file existence at it might instead be something like or even is some but might be truer to the principles of good unit testing let your express what it is trying to and let your unit tests test it and only just a thought hope it

 i have time to address all your questions at the moment may come back to this tomorrow but i can quickly answer the first it ok to use one file for all of my technically as in the language will allow you to do but you beyond the benefits of improving the organization of your it also lets you use a nice feature of php known as you follow the example that page you can define the function as makes it so that you have to explicity include all the files with your class as long as you put them in files named the same as the class autoloading will automatically include files as they are that in your code you show that you have a class named if you save this definition to a file named when you have a line of code new will automatically include at that this is very and is definitely good motivation to keep each class in its own

 i may quote my answer to the question stompchicken core issue here is that stemming algorithms operate on a phonetic basis with no actual understanding of the language working they have no understanding of the language and do not run from a dictionary of they have no way of recognizing and responding appropriately to irregular such as you need to handle irregular need to either choose a different approach or augment your stemming with your own custom dictionary of corrections to run after the stemmer has done its

 i rather think your objectives are too why constraint what you need is technically a from the domain of your constraint 3 goes against be better off with a algorithm governed by a secret where the secret key is hard to derive even if you know the results for a large set of what are you anonymizing if you are dealing with personal how will you protect against statistical analysis revealing that xyzzy is actually john based on the relations to other some research on countering such attack vectors for use existing cryptographic primitives rather than trying to invent your encryption algorithms exist aes in that are aes is well supported by all modern presumably ruby as encryption still give records anonymity in any strong	
 i read your question is is an ambiguous grammar or production rule consider the language you are what would be the implication of allowing an ambiguous production rule into the example describes a language which might include an expression b t b t b resolved as in your second example would be t b b t b t but in an ambiguous grammer it could also become t b t b t b or even t b t b t b t which could be valid might depend on the if the operator models it really be but if it was it might be this really depends on the second question to consider is what the resulting grammar source file ends up looking after the conflicts are as with other source a grammar is meant to be read by and secondarily also by prefer a notation that gives a clearer explanation of what the parser is trying to do from the that if the parser is executing some possibly undefined for order of evaluation of a arguments in an eager make the grammar	
 i really know glsl been doing gpgpu programming with the amd stream which has different programming you comment on i gather that you are interested in using the gpu to sort a huge database like creating a reverse phone book or but you have a small dataset and each fragment has own dataset to more like trying to do median pixel can only say in small the sort algorithm really while people have spent careers worrying about which is the best sort algorithm for very large for small n it really matter whether you use quick heap radix shell optimized bubble unoptimized bubble at least it matter much on a are simd so they like to have each kernel executing the same operations in lock calculations are cheap but branches are expensive and branches where each kernel branchs a different way is if each kernel has own small dataset to and the of data to sort is data dependent and it could be a different number for each probably better off picking a maximum size you padding the arrays with infinity or some large and having each kernel perform the exact same which would be an unoptimized branchless bubble something like i know sort of 9 points tmp min b a b a n n for i i twosort

 idea is to produce utility class so that whenever the guys hack the best currently known algorithms and new one comes to the market the only think that the developer would have to do is to add the class and change a global application setting for that the call would be string mynewencryptedstring i removed the old code and pasted the provided by rwwilden with the calling quess the proper wording would be as oppose of since no salt is envolved here this seems to be the best solution according to the proposed using using using namespace summary description for public class encrypter encrypts according to the passed plain name for hasing see cryptoconfig class from msdn for more plain text to plain name of the hashing algorithm the encrypted string public static string encrypt string string stralgorithmname string strhashedtxt bytplain strplaintxt using objalgorithm stralgorithmname bythash bytplain strhashedtxt bythash return method old code requires recoding encrypts according to the passed plain name for hasing see cryptoconfig class from msdn for more plain text to plain name of the hashing algorithm the encrypted string static string encrypt string string stralgorithmname string strhashedtxt bytplains strplaintxt objcryptoconfig new cryptoconfig switch case sha1cryptoserviceprovider objprovforsha1alg stralgorithmname bythash bytplains strhashedtxt bythash case md5cryptoserviceprovider objprovformd5alg stralgorithmname bythash bytplains strhashedtxt bythash if strhashedtxt throw new exception provider called by invalide simple name return method class class static void main args string strplaintxt string stralgorithmname type of string strhashedtxt with one the stralgorithmname start plain text is strplaintxt encrypting algorithm is stralgorithmname strhashedtxt stralgorithmname hashed text is strhashedtxt the stralgorithmname end change the stralgorithmname the stralgorithmname start plain text is strplaintxt encrypting algorithm is stralgorithmname strhashedtxt stralgorithmname hashed text is strhashedtxt the stralgorithmname end stralgorithmname the stralgorithmname start plain text is strplaintxt encrypting algorithm is stralgorithmname strhashedtxt stralgorithmname hashed text is strhashedtxt the stralgorithmname end enter to to create encrypting

 idea should work decently though the solution he posted looks a bit think any need for inverse multiplication in this my the string we currently have hashed is and we want to append and remove like my basic hash algorithm will unsigned ret for i i ret over by ret the current ret return to implement like to add something at the end and remove the first we can add the last simply subtract the first firstchar important you have to be careful about you can choose to just let it overflow unsigned but i think much more prone to collision also my namespace unsigned unsigned long long ret for i i ret ret return const using long longs to avoid long long hash1 long long hash2 could use exponentiation by squaring for extra long long power for i i power for i i the last hash2 hash2 the first if if hash2 power if can be made positive with hash2 if hash1 return i return cout werther warhol wendy waldo

 implementation is for a few your method should have a single purpose to call right you are putting far too much logic in and not actually of the single idisposable resource you you do not need a finalizer at since you do not directly own or allocate any unmanaged the only resource that you are disposing of is a which is and will implement its own finalizer as if you want to trap and find the cases where a connection was not disposed i would set up a finalizer to warn of that the finalizer in idisposable is meant to handle the case where the gc must do the cleanup because the caller forgot to call in your the finalizer will take care of that for part of the idisposable pattern as suggested in the design guidelines from microsoft states that the client should be able to call multiple times with no there should be nothing using the socket directly after the first call to in i would suggest that should call or as and immediately set to prevent this from being a with your current it is very possible to have the calls in cause the socket to throw an exception on subsequent calls to which should be a strong suggestion to have a method on all resources that use a or other should call there should be checks for use of the any method on the connection used after disposal should throw an

 implemented a lot of the code in zend other have the reason that returns strings instead of native php integers or floats is that database extensions return and the reason for that is that there might be no native php type to represent certain database is a signed by the php type is limited to so if you fetch data from the database and implicitly convert it to some values might be there are several other similar for and the string representation for all data types is the best way to remain simple and be safe about avoiding data and avoid writing lots of code to do data type that extra code would incur a performance if you have specific cases where you need database results to be mapped to native php data you should implement it yourself in your application code in a custom

 implementing idisposable most including the framework suggest including a bool member in order to safely allow multiple calls to as well as to throw when works fine for a single when you subclass from your disposable and a subclass contains its own native resources and unique things get a little bit most samples show how to override but do not go beyond that to handling are two questions that i have in this subclass and the base class both need to be able to track the state of there are a couple of main options i know of declare private bool in both each class tracks its own and throws as use protected bool disposed private instead of a this would let the subclass check the disposed provide some protected helper method to check the disposed and throw by pulling the current type name via reflection if the object is advantages as disadvantages i see to each by option this to me since it contains duplicated but seems to work i often use this when subclassing other this takes out the duplicated but is not the way the design guidelines books are this is what i typically since it keeps it a single point for this seems like the cleanest option to but appear in standard it may be a little less expected of an approach than others from users of the at one point or have tried using all three of these i would like to know advantages and disadvantages to the three as well as any other ideas for a better way to handle what choice would you make in handling and throwing the what do you use for the name i know the method call new is a comment this from a microsoft employee suggesting that implementing the concrete full name is the appropriate the third option this would be the only meaningful if the class implements the throwing you could potentially return the name of the class that defines the method that was the base class could return the base not the concrete think this is a good idea but i ran into this on some code written by somebody are there advantages or disadvantages to having the name of the class implementing the method objectdisposedexception correctly in an idisposable class

 important to remember that data validation which is relevant to an application always the same thing as data validation relevant to a database a simple registration form where a user creates an account with a username and you perform validation on the password because you want it to be x number of characters in length and contain a good mix of character types none of this is relevant to validate the data for database because you going to store passwords going to store a hash of them in some way md5 instead you might make sure that you have a 32 character hexadecimal string so that it is very likely to be a properly created md5 password example the only just a good one for explanation here in this the i think any sometimes you will want to validate the data sometimes do it once an only in the just match it as best as possible to your	
 importantly always have code reviewed before it is if the group is ensuring consistency of style within it becomes much easier to read each if the reviewer cannot understand a section of code then appropriate comments should be added or changes code revision alone can solve many of your problems by consistent meaningful variable and method code divided into classes that make comments to explain whatever is not easily helpful technique is quick daily meetings in which each person describes what they did during the previous day and what is planned for the next as a result if you have to look at someone code your you have a general picture of what they have been doing and can hit the ground

 initializer in seems to need the as me it works like	
 initializers were something added to in order to simplify construction of objects when using an given 0 or more and are used to create and initialize an object the calling method gets the handle to the created for myobjectinstance new this the constructor of myobject will be run with the values param1 and these are both used to create the new myobject in the created object is setup using those gets and set to considered good practice to have a constructor require the parameters needed in order to completely setup an so that impossible to create an object in an invalid there are often properties that could be but are not this could be handled through overloaded but leads to having lots of constructors that necessarily useful in the majority of leads to object initializers an object initializer lets you set properties or fields on your object been but you can use it by anything for myobjectinstance new myproperty will behave exactly the same as if you do myobjectinstance new object initializers are simpler to read when you set multiple so they give you the same benefit as many overloads on the without the need to have many overloads complicating the api for that

 is a specfic however i believe that the model should be responsible for the validity of its own if this is the case then the validation belongs in the however this may not always be achievable and it may be necessary to perform validation in the however i think this should be in addition to the validation performed in the model not a replacement for problem with only having validation in the view is that at some point you will probably want another view on your your site may become popular and customers are asking for xml based apis to generate their own do you then rely on the customer to validate the if you do not have to provide apis some customers may want customized views that are sufficiently different to warrant a completely different version of the again you now have validation in the views think the ideal scenario is to have your model do the validation but to make the results of the validation available for the view to read and render the page again with the validation results think it is perfectly reasonable to have the view doing validation if you want to instantly display validation data back to the user etc but the final decision on data validity should rest with the

 is coming you might have an sql injection vulnerability in your code if not escaping it or using a prepared the select statement inside a for loop jumps out as a bad if the table is not that then select the contents of the entire table and then iterate through the result set in php to build the tree data this could take up to iterations in the pathological case of your tree being a linked stop when all nodes have been added to the or the number of remaining nodes remains the same from one iteration to the next this means the remaining nodes are not children of your root if your database supports recursive sql you can use and it will only select the nodes that are children of your parent you will still have to build the tree object yourself in the form of the query would be something as select from pages where id union select from pages temptable where select from the on the second line with the starting page

 is technically possible to reach up into the parent control and have your way with the controls it but it makes for code very difficult to maintain because if you change the structure of the parent you break code in all of the contained that would be considered a very design and often somehwat cleaner design would be to have your page classes raise an event when the save button is then your parent frame can sink the event and refresh whatever it knows needs to be refreshed after a save easier to maintain because your components are more loosely but it still puts a lot of database knowledge into your gui such a design might be appropriate for a relatively simple app on which you expect to do a lot of maintenance or future design pattern i prefer do many is to isolate the database handling and business logic inside one or more classes with a simple programmatic interface that can be tested the gui components are kept as simple and thin as so they can be easily changed if this is often called a pattern but there are other names for in your the class that encapsulates your business logic would have properties and methods for reading and setting and a or method that writes changes to a once the save is complete it would raise a or event that notifies all controls displaying information that the information has changed and they would refresh themselves based on the new values of the properties of your controller

 java enums classes believe there is a difference at the bytecode with the additional benefit of having a known fixed set of possible instances and being able to use them in switch can emulate the fixed set of possible with regular classes pattern described in countless books and but quite some work for every such to get it to work really correctly in regard to and and perhaps some other things i enums spare you that as mentioned only enums can be used in switch

 jet autonumber field is not an identity it is only a long integer field with a special default that default value can be increment or but as it is only a default you can append any long integer value to the field as long as it violate the incrementing autonumber will never revert to 1 except if deleted all records and or in the event of a corrupt seed the latter happened frequently in the early versions of jet 4 service pack where the seed value would get and this would lead to all sorts of including corrupted pk that eventually got and because jet is a windows hardly any computer out there is going to have anything less than jet 4 service pack onedaywhen you can get negative values if the incrementing autonumber exceeds the maximum positive value for long but this would indicate to me that you probably have enough records in your table that you need a different database or improperly treating your table as a temp table appending and deleting large numbers of others have also uniqueness is not controlled by the autonumber data but by the if you created a you could append duplicate i imagine why want an autonumber field with duplicate but the point is that you can do it if you add a unique since most autonumber fields are used as surrogate primary they will have the unique pk and the data table will be written in pk order in regard to if you are using an autonumber as a surrogate pk and you have any natural keys in the table that should be unique be no nulls you should also have a unique index on the natural key single field or a compound

 judicious use of another tool freely available on the following two scripts do the job you get password with no set in do set this just to prove we have the get password with no echo then echo oscriptpw simply uses the password object to input the password from the user and then print it to standard output paragraph will explain why that show up in the is a bit trickier command scripts usually set command simply outputs the prompt with no trailing a sneaky way to emulate it sets to an empty string as a side effect and wait for input since taking its input from the in do set statement is the trickiest it runs the vbscript with no microsoft advertising so that the only line output is the password the vbscript the delimiters to nothing is required to capture input lines with otherwise you just get the first the do set sets to be the actual password output from the we echo a blank line terminate the and echo the password so you can verify it is my is available with xp and 2k3 but not necessarily later for vista and presumably win7 are give them a mask the the script takes advantage of the scriptpw com scriptpw is loaded by default on windows xp and windows if running windows 2000 or windows you will need to copy the file from the folder of an xp or windows 2003 system to the or folder on your windows 2000 or vista once the dll has been you will need to register it by running the successfully register the dll on a vista you will need to open the command prompt as to do click start all programs then on the command prompt shortcut and select as once at the command prompt as be able to successfully run the command to register the

 just started working for the first time with a product delivered via the linux rpm rather than as a standalone and realized that this makes the test release cycle a bit more i was working with we would just change the build numbering in our build system to mark a build as a test or release candidate instead of a development and tell people to install only the candidate build for the problem with doing that with rpms is that if we change the numbering break the delivery mechanism and installed machines be able to tell which is the latest version of the rpm any best way thought of to get around this is to put the candidate rpms in a completely separate rpm but this also gets complicated because we have multiple rpms coming from the same repository that are on different release so be trying to pull the release candidate version of rpm a from the new repository while still wanting to get development snapshots of rpm b from the development must be a pretty common issue for linux so can anyone tell me the best practice thanks in advance a release cycle with a product delivered via

 key pair is not used to encrypt the whole instead it is used to the a to sign a file such as an assembly you take a hash of the file and then ecrypt that hash with your private someone using the file verifies your signature by making a hash of the file themselves and then decrypting your encrypted hash using your public key and confirming these two hashes are the this proves two assembly is from who is claims to be from you as it has been produced with your private assembly been altered by someone else as the hash you made when you released the assembly is the same as the current can alter the signed assembly since they would also have to make corresponding changes to the encrypted hash which requires your private is a lot more detail about digital signatures in wikipedia great thing about key pairs is that they work either way so something encrypted with your private key can be only decrypted with your public key but also something encrypted with your public key can be decrypted with your private this latter use means that if someone wants to send something to you and only you then then can encrypt it with your freely available public key but they know only you with your private key can decrypt the keys only work as a pair making the someone else simply reverse the encryption done with the public key to get the message to	
 key piece of information in the question is percent we can shave off processing time saves us tens thousands of dollars per you need to consider much it will to shave each percent if that optimization effort costs tens of thousands of dollars per then it worth you could make a bigger saving by firing a the right skills today are rarer and therefore more you can assembler to get the fastest possible with slightly less rare you can do almost as well with some really c and so the more performance you squeeze out of the more it will cost you in development and there will be diminishing returns for ever greater if the profit from this stays at of thousands of dollars per then there will come a point where it is no longer worth the in fact i would hazard a guess already at that point because of thousands of dollars per is in the range of one and probably not enough to buy the skills required to a complex would guess that if you have code already written in the effort of rewriting it all as a direct translation in another language will be wasted it will very likely perform slower simply because you be taking advantage of the capabilities of the but instead working against trying to use java as if it was within your existing there will be parts that make a crucial contribution to the running time run and other parts that are totally irrelevant run so if you have some idea for speeding up the there is no economic sense in wasting time applying it to the parts of the program that affect the running use a profiler to find the hot and see where time is being wasted in the existing when i noticed the reference to the code being that if you focus your effort on removing bottlenecks so that your program can scale well over a large number of then it will automatically get faster every year at a rate that will dwarf any other optimization you can this time next quad cores will be standard on the year after 8 cores will be getting cheaper bought one over a year ago for a few thousand and i would predict that a 32 core machine will cost less than a developer by that

 keys will need absolute uniqueness not high probability of i would suggest using guids instead of hashes for your keys for generate the hash as a quick look up mechanism you can have a index on this but in the case of collision have to compare the actual data to make sure they are the in synchronizing your databases you can check the hash using the and if you find a then resolve whether the data is the same thus the guids needs to be if there is no then simply update whichever database needs the missing entry and insert using the guid from the other see little point in creating your own hash of hashes to save if you already have the other just use them if just use a standard hash function like md5 or sha1 and store the resulting

 know at so anything i say about should be taken with a grain of i will try to explain what goes on in that piece of ruby has something called these have nothing to do with the singleton software design they are just methods that are defined for one and only one you can have two instances of the same and add methods to one of those two are two different syntaxes for singleton one is to just prefix the name of the method with the so would define a method only for object the other method is called up the singleton and it looks syntactically similar to defining a because also what happens singleton methods actually live in an invisible class that gets inserted between the object and its actual class in the class syntax looks like this opens up the singleton class of object and every method defined inside of that class body becomes a singleton method of object is this used ruby is a pure which means that including classes is an if methods can be added to individual and classes are this means that methods can be added to individual in other ruby has no need for the artificial distinction between regular methods and static methods are a they really just glorified what is a static method in is just a regular method on a class singleton of this is just a longwinded way of explaining that everything defined between and its corresponding becomes every variable that starts with a capital is actually a in this case we translate these as but rather an because how they are caches data received from a the difference between this method and usual is this method caches data and allows to data when it is expired data generation code more than once so bring our servers def ttl method has three parameters we will see exactly two of them are optional and both of them have a default in the case of the default value really it serves more as a marker to find out whether the argument was passed in or is an extension that the library adds to the it actually do it just returns it is used in this case just to make the method definition more are other methods which do something more which returns and and so we will use this as an that the type of the parameter should not be but rather fallback to default caching approach if no ttl return yield unless contains several complex ruby start with the easiest trailing conditional if a conditional body contains only one then the conditional can be appended to the end of the instead of saying a b then foo you can also say if a the above is equivalent to ttl then return yield next one is also is just syntactic sugar for we are now at not ttl then return yield is truth in truth is pretty falseness is pretty and truth falls out the special keyword is and the special keyword is everything else is in this case the conditional will be if is either or a terrible sensible value for a so the only interesting one is the snippet would have been more clearly written like then return yield since the default value for the parameter is this conditional is if no argument was passed in for the conditional is used to figure out with how many arguments the method was which means that we are not going to translate it as a conditional but rather as a method on to the in every method can accept an implicit code block as an why i wrote above that the method actually takes not a code block is just an anonymous piece of code that can be passed stored in a and invoked later ruby inherits blocks from but the concept dates all the way back to to lambda at the mention of anonymous code but at the very least at the mention of lambda you should know how to represent this implicit fourth method a delegate more a it transfers control to the basically just a very convenient way of invoking a without having to explicitly store it in a variable and then calling create window for data ttl syntax is called it means the token inside the string with whatever the result of evaluating the expression between the just a very concise version of which is exactly what we are going to translate it try to get data from value stale if stale key has it is time to our unless value nil force data if no data retrieved or data data and reset stale unless value return is my feeble attempt at translating the ruby version to class static const enum stale created caches data received from a the difference between this method and usual is this method caches data and allows to data when it is expired data generation code more than once so bring our servers public static tvalue timespan timespan create window for data var realttl ttl generationtime var stalekey try to get data from var value var stale if stale key has it is time to our if is value force data if no data retrieved or data data and reset stale if is value return fallback to default caching approach if no ttl public static tvalue return simulate default argument for has default so this be public static tvalue timespan return new convenience overloads to allow calling it the same way as in by just passing in the timespans as integers in public static tvalue int int return new new public static tvalue int return new note that i do not know i do not know i have not tested i even know if it is syntactically hope it helps

 know this is not the answer you are most probably looking for but i would suggest that such a framework will be very hard not to find for doing something like dumping the stack cannot be done in a portable way as it can in a language like which not only shares a common runtime accross all but provides powerful introspection capabilities program in but my guess is that it can provide a in the same way as the stack is probably just another object in the runtime which can be inspected and on the other hand has none of these its meant to be a language that basically adds to c sure others will come up with much more elanorate explanations of over c but thats another is not rich enough at the level required to provide the kind of features you require in a generic there may be some code that could get some of this info at defined points for you out but it certainly wont be standards regards to graphs that sounds much more like which you should either be able to find something or more you can perhaps output your log messages in a format which can be interpreted by some of these existing things you could look at would be integrating with for which there may be richer analysis tools for would provide you with a capability along the lines of the one advertised for smartinspect that is based a lot of what i said here about comes from previous experiences trying to find decent frameworks in to do introspective type things as proper mock objects

 last possibility here is that there is a big in the xml serialization these were more common years but possible there are still a what could happen given perfectly legal xml serialization markup on your or vb creating an xmlserializer for the type would cause illegal code to be created for the serialization the compile would choke and and then loading the assembly would usually with a filename of or something there was a secret incantation you could utter to tell the xmlserialization engine to preserve the code it but i remember what it is it was not i only learned of it when working with the ms engineers debugging one of these but bet you can find it in

 listening to the framework guidelines for once actually helps plenty of material in the book is just plain elements of java style yet again in redmond should avoid similar type names in cross or mixing namespaces mixing across domains and models in generial even in one that is extremellly strict and it also has an incarnation in resolution and compiler crashes and even fully qualifying all the time is no btw aliases and are extremely limited and cause mild duplication at as well as prove weakness in generic programming etc my data domain types are a primary target for a more appropriate and thus for name refactoring which cheap a process in rich asts but simple support like in in ide and feel powerful according to dynamic ruby also be read dynamic features sheep will blame everyone but not think about namespaces or functional or similar communicates the semantics better the intent plumbing support to build your own processing usually of primitive but typed nature or message typed not critique as in aforementioned book which itself breaks straight out of intro lifts all to reference and becomes a useful artifact in usage is actually possible and quite programming really are no rules but beware that you will see mixing of namespaces in development when least which means only one thing for a plus somewhat less more and intellinonsense errors of problem in all so it is your even tool vendors can mess up for machines to say output of enhanced popular ides based on outdated browse then others do it real well for managed that i am against duplicating there are cases are tough but when mixing dual interop representation etc other models where same name makes it more where duplication is a necessity of but that is lower level idioms that is not friendly or encouraging of in favour of

 looking for the best way to store a set of as well as comments on those posts in imagine a design similar to a on facebook where users can write posts on their wall and other users can comment on those i need to be able to display all wall posts as well as the i first started i came up with a table such table id uuid not posted timestamp not userid uuid not posterid uuid not parentid uuid not comment text not is parentid will be null on original posts and point to an id if the row is a comment on an existing easy enough and super fast to insert new doing a select which would return of which order the rows existed in the database proved to be extremely i obviously just order by as someone might comment on post 1 after post 2 has been if i do a left join to get the parent post on all and then sort by that date all the original posts group together as have a value of i got this table id uuid not threadposted posted comment an original threadposted and posted would be the on a timestamp would be the time the original post was posted and would be the time the comment on that thread was now i can just from wallposts order by works however one thing irks if two people create a post at the same comments on the two posts would get munged together as have the same i could use instead of a but still the accuracy is only of a i could also setup a unique constraint on threadposted and posted which makes inserts a bit more but if i had multiple database servers in a the chance of a collision is still i almost went ahead with this anyway since the chances of this happening are extremely but i wanted to see if i could eat my cake and still have it mostly for my own educational solution would be to store this data in the form of a each node would have a and i could order by which would traverse the tree in the order i every time someone inserts a comment have to re balance the whole this would create a ton of row and all sorts of problems if the site was very kinda extreme and also causes replication so i tossed this idea also thought about just storing the original posts and then serializing the comments in a binary since who cares about individual this would be very however if a user wants to delete their comment or append a new comment to the i have to deserialize this modify the then serialize it back and update the if a bunch of people are commenting on the same post at the same i might have random issues with what i eventually i query for all the posts ordered by date in the middle ware i loop through the recordset and create a of original each node on the stack points to a linked list of when i come across an original i push a new node on the stack and when i come across a comment i add a node to the linked i organize this in memory so i can traverse the recordset once and have after i create the representation of the i traverse through this data structure again and write out this works great and has super fast inserts and super fast and no weird row locking however a bit heavier on my presentation layer and requires me to build an in memory representation of the wall to move stuff around so in the right i believe this is the best approach found so thought check with other sql experts to see if a better way to do this using some weird joins or unions or something which would still be performant with millions of is the best way to store a threaded message in

 lot of universities and educational institutions tend to start their students off in script languages like within this language you can practice techniques used in object oriented once you start understanding the theory you can look at taking that theory over to java and then maybe start on core understanding in the foundations of good solid programming you will be able to use and take into other languages and you will find the curve less steep as you would say above all though that i cannot recommend a career in programming highly is only my opinion	
 love to hear from the programmers about why mvc with java said to fall there is absolutely nothing wrong with implementing mvc in just about any a not a language never heard anyone say in java falls before my guess is that either the quote was taken out of context or the person who made the statement has little experience with java or intended something to use the classes in cocoa just to write a cocoa nice that and that all kinds of great support in the tools interface to use and there are probably very few cases where you use but nothing fundamental to the language that makes an mvc implementation than an mvc implementation that was coded in just as the cocoa frameworks provide all kinds of great support for mvc with the various controller and view there are scores of good frameworks for java which provide support for implementing

 main problem i see here is one of you say you want your ann to take the current board position and evaluate how good it is for a assume you will take every possible move for a apply it to the current board evaluate via the ann and then take the one with the highest output hill options as i see them some heuristic function to evaluate the board state and train the network off but that begs the question of why use an ann at when you could just use your some statistical measure such as many games were won by white or black from this board which would give you a fitness value between white or the difficulty with that is the amount of training data required for the size of your problem the second option you could always feed it board sequences from grandmaster games and hope there is enough coverage for the ann to develop a to the complexity of the problem want to throw the largest network lots of internal at it as i could without slowing down the training too	
 main problem is your collision resolution algorithm you can speed up the drawing and the collision but that stop your balls collapsing into each the problem you have is much more difficult to solve cleanly than it it is possible to do it your in the configuration that fails your objects should really be sliding against each not sliding is a continuous which is different from the kind of constraints your implementation simplest thing you can do to prevent the collapse is to recheck all colliding objects to make sure they interpenetrating you do the collision handling potentially iterating as many times as necessary until of them violate the this will of course take longer possibly much longer even raises the possibility of an infinite though maybe not in that particular are good algorithms that will make your simulation but they are more complicated than your they involve considering mutually interacting bodies the balls in the as a and adjusting their collective configuration to satisfy their mutual should look for works web about i say which is likely to be most useful for your if i were i would start by visiting a good university library and looking through whatever books they have on the you should be prepared for some serious if terms like make you break out in look out if you go this you will likely learn a lot of and no small amount of

 members must be declared virtual if you use lazy loading because nhibernate will create proxy objects for your entities at so do not use lazy loading or just declare the event as virtual that is not so but it is creates proxy classes for all lazy loaded entities and uses them where an entity is referenced but not yet accessing this proxy triggers loading the real entity from the this approach requires to inherit from your entity class at runtime and override the public members hence this members to be there is another you can add to the class then you do not need virtual members while proxys just implement the given

 mentioned counting the number of set bits in a byte as a programming question in his guide to and talked of a way to take advantage of patterns that occur in the lookup i wrote an article about it awhile back after i found the of bits set in a byte in 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 5 6 6 7 6 7 7 first row and column are exactly the and each position in the grid can be calculated by adding the first values in that row and because of you only need a lookup table with 16 entries for an and can just use the first 16 if you wanted to count the set bits in the number for just 243 16 15 243 16 are there six bits set in the number 11110011 next pattern i noticed after that was that each time you double the size of the nxn each quadrant could be calculated by adding and 2 to each like make a 4x4 grid on the and fill in the upper left quadrant with the values of the 2x2 for each add the value from that same quadrant in the 2x2 grid to the upper left quad add 0 to each number from 2x2 1 2 upper right quad add 1 to each number from 1 1 2 2 2 3 lower left quad add 1 to each number from 1 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 lower right quad add 2 to each number from 1 1 2 2 2 3 2 2 3 3 3 this process two more and get the 16x16 grid from so i figured there must be some sort of quadtree algorithm that would allow you to start from the given a number generate the lookup table on the fly and figure out the number of so my you figure out an algorithm to do just of set bits in a

 most living the database is in some amount of flux between project tables and columns are or lookup tables are and you could be testing against multiple instances of the so good to have some validation of the state of metadata and data in the as part of your regression are several cases where i would suggest testing a verify the tables and views you expect to verify that these tables and views contain the columns you you can also verify that or columns you dropped in this milestone are in fact try to execute data changes that should be the constraints should prevent these you can avoid later bugs if you catch cases where the constraints same as for and also triggers can be used for cascading or to transform test these logic i support the caution against putting too much logic into the when the logic is more easily and maintained in the application but there are cases when there are compelling reasons to use stored often you see a performance bottleneck solved by putting complex logic into the so stored procs are not going away and testing them is a good lookup tables are an example of data that needs to be present even in an there can be other test that the database contains the required you application code is laced with sql test them for proper functionality and also for especially performance because the same query can perform well one day and become a bottleneck the next as the volume of data indexes grow like orm classes in your application can contain logic to or monitor database these should be tests might not accurately be called unit testing is a specific type of testing where each test is independent from other and you try to test small units of code in say testing the database the ways outlined above is an example of

 most responders so i work with embedded environments that do not resemble desktop systems at and therefore cannot emulate the embedded system on the order to write good testing you need your test system to have feedforward and jtag is the most common way to control the you can set the complete state of the device even the entire board if and then set the test code to at which point you get your jtag can also serve as a feedback a logic analyzer with an software api is the best in this you can look for certain levels on count pulses and even parse data streams from streaming

 namespaces were not intended to be a design mechanism they are there simply to prevent name you really want or need to use nested namespaces in of good example of the correct use of namespaces in is the standard everything in this quite large library is placed in a single namespace called there is no attempt or need to break the library up into an a math a container basic tool for modelling in is the class to some extent the not the if you feel the need for you should consider using nested which have the following advantages over have can control cannot be considered if you still wish to use nested namespaces by all means do so there is nothing technically wrong with using them in this	
 naming convention is one of the patterns in kent book best practice imho this book is a even for as it really helps naming things and writing plus probably one of the few pattern langages to exhibit without a good book on code patterns is with which is as a free the convention is that instance variables and accessors use the bare and parameters use the indefinite article plus either a role or a or a temporary variables can use bare nouns because they rarely duplicate the instance quite frequent to name them with more precision than just an indefinite in order to indicate their role in the control

 need some framework that will help me to do asynchronous streaming over it may look like soap ws or somethign i know if i name it so here is what i wants to make a request to remote serverb over the request contains arbitrary result for it is going to contain multiple records of the same some of them are available other are available servera wants to get available results as soon as without waiting until all results are in real world serverb will search across different data some of which are more responsive that can think of 3 kinds of servera generates random id of performs soap request will return and then a periodically calls servera polls serverb fore new i call this method it involves multiple connections established from a to another solution is to expose receiving service on servera like call serverb pushes new results to when new results are i call it it involves 1 connection established from a to b and multiple connection established from b to option is to stream results over same http within single performs http call know if it can be soap or should be something b starts searching and when new results are it sends them over http stream and flushes so they may be available on the a side it does not close http connection until all results are it involves only single connection from a to thats why i would prefer to use i call it i understand that it may not work if some proxy is on the way that buffers the response my question is if there is any solution that will do most of the work for what like to do is call such code on a s new or or r new callback new void e should be null if finished void implement it on serverb serviceimpl implements void callback perform call when new results are the rest is handled by including reestablishing connection when it is falling to if streaming can not be done because of buffering calling when serverb finishes work or throws the probbaly it should also handle authentication in some standard is there any solution that abstracts the way commuinication is and is capabale of streaming when there is do you think it would be useful to implement it as open web service

 needed this exact and realized quickly that mutagen is not a distant enough abstraction to do this kind of the authors of mutagen needed it for their media player had to dig through the quodlibet source to find out how to use but once i understood i wrote a utility called which is intended to be a command line equivalent to tagging it uses this abstraction mechanism and provides some added abstraction and you want to check out the a link to the latest the package is actually a set of three command line scripts and a module for interfacing with if you want to install the whole you can thing to keep in mind about consequently is that they actually implement audio metadata which means that all tags support multiple values the file type prohibits which there many that doing something not output a single but will output a list of strings first second way you might use it to copy tags would be something qllib this is the module that comes with mp3 flac you can iterate over the tag they will be the same for all file for in in if

 never actually used the google app engine for a project yet but the first thing you need to understand about its persistence is that it is not a relational i believe it uses a key value you sort of need to think of persistence in a different way when using the app the following features of the jpa interface are not supported by the app engine and unowned you can implement unowned relationships using explicit key though type checking is not enforced in the you cannot use a field of a child entity in a filter when performing a query on the parent note that you can test the relationship field directly in query using a queries you cannot perform a query of a class to get instances of a each class is represented by a separate entity kind in the

 not sure about a hash function that does exactly what you are asking but it seems that a structure similar to how git stores its revisions might do what you need was inspired by how monotone stored its computes the sum of each of the files in the these are used as blob it then has a which maps filenames to blob ids other for the identifier of a tree is its its not relevant to your i the trees are then referred to by which include things like and one or more parent means that you have to the sum for each blob as you update you just recompute the for the blob that and recompute the for the could do the same with your compute the hash of each of your and put all your mappings into one and compute the hash of if the file containing is too big for you to want to it each you could divide it into and have a where each section had one level of branching should generally be sufficient for most but you can build a tree structure out of these if you really need

 not sure why of the answers mention reflection good polymorphism works just fine for getting the runtime type name is easy just only somewhat tricky part is maintaining unique counters per been discussed before on so but i find a link the bottom is that you can either generics or maintain a to keep generic version works because each different type parameter creates a different generic class so they each have different static class where t private static int counter private static object synclock new protected lock public string name get return private string blur sharpen no need to override anything in the derived but you do have to make sure your inherited is correct or share i also used a lock to synchronize access to counter assuming create instances from more than 1 you like the generic then a works just as class command private static counter new private static object synclock new protected type t lock if public string name get return private string blur command sharpen command be creating of probably profile both and check memory i particularly care for the generic approach since easy to screw up and pass the wrong type parameter but i suspect memory usage is a bit if going to create have to worry about that being not sure why you just maintain an index addressable collection and reference them by index like

 not use something for example a normal web server handles a lot of small files very well and lots of people already spent time in optimizing the the second benefit is that the transfer is done with http which is an established and is easily switched to ssl if you need more the they are also no problem with a script or custom module with the same method you can also add long as you need to dynamically seek the files i guess this would be one of the best

 not very familiar with struts so take me advice for what are two ways to approach this that i first probably is to add an event to the checkboxes which stores the checked state in an array or object on callback from the ajax restore those second approach would require that the ajax refresh either be executed as a post so that the checkboxes are submitted to the or having a separate ajax action which fires off when a checkbox is with either of these the ajax refresh could at render which checkboxes to render as you decide to go with number the javascript is not very especially if you happen to be using a good library

 not worth worrying too much about the hash functions of the standard jdk even if you could override string in hash function is practically always there are maybe a few certain classes such as biginteger and collections calculate their hash code every time by cycling through every single element they which is pretty spurious in some but how often do you key on instances of those designing hash codes for your own the thing trying to do is spread hash codes over the range of to do you generally want to the bits of successive fields in your object may be interested in an article on my web site that graphically illustrates the string hash code mixes multiplying the current hash by an odd number generally a prime then adding in the hash of the next element generally works sufficiently well as a first problems can occur with this method for the codes being combined tend to have zeroes in their lower generally no practical hash function absolutely guaranteed to work well in all you can consider testing your hash generate a series of random objects even use some real calculate their hash and off the 16 bits of the hash and then see how many collisions you check that the number of collisions you get roughly matches the number of collisions expect to get by for if you and off the bottom 16 bits of the hash code then after 1000 random expect about 8 after expect about 30 far as performance is then up to some i think that getting a hash code well distributed will generally be more beneficial nowadays than sacrificing hash quality for hash calculation

 notice that in your first the simple record is sorted before record this order is also how you see the results in the regardless of whether you sort by would seem to make sense to me if the dates exactly the and the date for is before the date for instead of finding that the are exactly equal then proceeding to sort by the query finds that the dates are not equal and simply sorts by that like all the other see from browsing around that sqlite have a native understanding of date or datetime data types and instead gives users the choice of floating point numbers or text that they must parse is it possible that the literal representation of the dates in the database are not exactly most people seem to need to date so that dates behave like you would perhaps a way to wrap your order by column with a that will give you something concrete to like attending not sure that syntax but an area to look at for solving your hope that

 noting that the reason actually that the size of the enum is not yet known after forward you use forward declaration of a struct to be able to pass a pointer around or refer to an object from a place refered to in the forward declared struct definition itself declaring an enum would not be too because one would wish to be able to pass around the enum you even have a pointer to because i recently got told some platforms use pointers of different size for char than for int or so it all depends on the content of the current standard explicitly disallows doing something like but the next standard due to next year allows the which convinced me the problem actually to do with the underlying x known as a enum you can even use x in the following and its enumerators can later be defined in a later redeclaration of the see in the current working

 now programmers think of source code control as integrating packets of but why not make those packets smaller and integrate would say dvcs are already basically doing this not because they are but because commiting is so much with git i commit far more often than with it also makes it simple to commit or specific of code add or and is generally much more focused on tracking lines of rather than complete files like the way git inherently works as you changes would be saved as checked of when you the changes are then you push them to the remote machine with a separate you could commit every time you then rebase them into a single commit if you for a tool that does version you could do this quite simply with a shell something 1 git add git commit at sleep is a which does something watches a specific and commits all the changes to a standalone git use just not sure why want to do i find one of the most useful things about using a vcs is the diff of what changed the last it seems like having commits would just be the text has an interesting it visualises the undo with there is a on with

 object contains entries for all its plus extra space to hold a pointer to the the vmt holds more than just i explain about the at my web including a delphi 2009 introduces another hidden field in addition to the vmt pointer to hold the synchronization you can determine whether it is added at the beginning or at the end of the class with some simple ttest obj objaddr fieldaddr it prints the value then the monitor field must be at the end of the object because 4 only accounts for the size of the vmt if it prints the value then the monitor field must be at the adjacent to the vmt expect find the monitor at the it means that the layout of the descendant object simply the layout of the base object with all the new fields it would mean the offset of the monitor field depends on the type of the and that makes the implementation more a class implements an the object layout includes more hidden the fields contain pointers to the when you have an reference to an the pointer it holds the same as the pointer to the vmt which is what you have with an ordinary object the pointer value will be the address of the hidden written about the layout of classes that implement

 object of type cannot be bound to a for exactly the same reason that a cannot be converted to a allowing it would allow the programmer or to break type safety without a animal dangerousshark public animal cutekitten public animal animalptrref dangerousshark an illegal function think that some of the confusion arises because of the loose use of the words and be unlike objects which can be so in the context of references when we speak of conversion we can only be concerned about initializing a new are always bound to an and from the question it was clear that he is aiming to get a reference that is a direct bind to an existing this is only allowed if the object used to initialize the reference is with the type of the this is only if the types are the or the type of the object is derived from the type of the reference and the reference type is at least as as the initializing in pointers to different types are not regardless of the relationship of the other a reference can be initialized with something that can be converted to the reference in these the reference must be const and not volatile and the conversion will create a temporary and the reference will be bound to this temporary and not the original as pointed this is not suitable for the requirements of motivating a can be bound directly to a but a cannot be directly bound to a a can be initialized with a but the reference will actually bind to a temporary object from the

 objects do not have so if you come across a shape object in your recursion then it have any dynamic texfields inside it flash objects inside it as children for that might be confusing you is thinking that grouping objects on stage makes a it does the of objects on stage only exists in the flash editing interface for easy editing and once you publish they are not actually grouped in the may even be more confusing is that when you have multiple vector items on or even in some situations bitmap items on flash will just simplify flattened to a single shape this furthers the illusion that grouping objects creates a shape object with each one as a and therefore that a shape object could have but in reality all it did was flatten it all into one single shape with those graphics drawn flat onto it hold any of them as individual and that situation never happens with a dynamic so quite if you hit a shape object then there a dynamic textfield move on

 of the social networking sites like twitter use an rdbms at all but a message queue a lot of them start out with a already present application like some of them get big enough they have to heavily customize or build their twitter is in the process of doing this for the second message queue application works by holding messages from one service for one or more other for instance say service frank is publishing messages to a queue joe and jill are subscribed to franks foo the application will keep track of whether or not joe or jill have recieved the messages and once every subscriber to the queue has recieved the message it discards frank fires messages and forgets about joe and jill ask for messages from foo and get whatever messages they gotten joe and jill do whatever they need to do with the perhaps keeping it around perhaps message queue application guarantees that everyone who is supposed to get the message can and will get the message when they request the publisher can send the messages confident that subscriber can get them this has the benefit of being completely asynchronous and not requiring costly i should mention also that usually the storage for these kind of things at high scale are heavily so joe and jill may be storing a copy of the exact same this is considered ok because it helps the application scale to billions of

 opinion is and would be the best of the three for development that is web doubt anyone writes new web apps in c or it was done 10 years and likely a lot of legacy code still in but not particularly well there appear to be as much tool and they probably have a small active community that does web development perhaps for web server i wrote many website com objects back in the but is far more productive that no compelling reason to code c or this unless you need do still write if but typically for a small problem communicating from via to old doing some things that are downright clumsy in were a breeze to create a com object as a nice thing with is that you can also easily transfer into writing windows and console apps and stay in with mono also not limited to windows you may be limited to which libraries you this is all from a if you asked about embedded devices say c or you could argue none of these are suited for web but is pretty it works there are heaps of online a huge and free dev from a picking only one of and c as as a general better to stick with

 our current amazingly used 6 different tracking tools versions of mostly my opinion on the ones that listed them in order of my most favored to teamtrack we use a web the interface is performance will vary across but comparing with our same data in each this works the it also works in quality center this is also web but it is ie on the well easy to and it has reasonable performance for us as has an odd feature where there a save it saves automatically for to force a you have to navigate to another also when you first use it has to install so many dlls that it is practically a thick that being the ie sometimes gets locked up when trying to reinitialize a session after session once locked you occasionally have to kill ie to regain i use this as thoroughly as the other so this a fair we used it briefly for some internal i suppose the big upside is the i just find the interface as nice and easy to use as the other its been awhile so i apologize for lack of specifics for why relegating it below the there much to like about their defect tracking tool apart from that it is better than the interface seems as if the siebel interface has a set of user interface controls and it tries to force all square pegs into its round another downside is that it uses lengthy generated ids so its hard to reference them or search by along with the ticket ids pvcs we had separate databases and used both the web client and thick its been awhile so the details are i recall there were bugs in the tool and they getting for instance reports display certain performance was it took a long time to it was slow to navigate through

 out keyword enforces a couple of things via the caller have to initialize the the callee read from the param but has to write to it before exiting the more importantly the intent as the caller has to specify the out keyword when making a method can use out when you to return multiple values from a stuffing and destuffing them from an section that loves to return bsuccess from every function would love the out the example that you primary return value is the success of the parse so that is return value but the most probable subsequent need would be to obtain the parsed object if it so instead of making all callers do that tryparse saves you the trouble by giving it as an out since it has already done that as part of the canparse

 part of upgrading we are moving from a jvm to a now i am getting a really strange oracle db is in an inconsistent i have pinned down the problem to insert queries that do not use bind variables at all all inline if i run the query without any bind i get the above as soon as i replace one of the hard coded values with a bind variable everything works without other strange bit is that after executing the it is in fact committed to the i can connect from another session and see the inserted i have tried wrapping the query in a transaction and it seems to succeed as the behavior is unchanged from the query without an explicit are the relevant machine through i am using cfqueryparam they are called bind variables in the oracle while that does solve the immediate we have a rather large legacy code base that we realistically go through all of to update the queries as part of upgrading from cf7 to though i have pinned down one specific situation that fails encapsulated it in an mxunit that mean there other areas where this may be an i would really like to have a solution in place that removes the oall8 error rather than coding around after checking with our dba he had set a parameter called to the oracle default is what is happening is when coldfusion hands the query off to be oracle is turning all the literal values to bind variables and that appears to be confusing turning the setting back to exact allows the literal queries to work just oracle finally issued us an patch for it was identified as a jdbc the latest drivers should include it when they are finally if you have support you can also request the patch through their tar oall8 is in an inconsistent

 passing a for primitives is a either you need to modify the and in that case you pass a or you just need to access the value and in that case you pass a should only be used for complex when copying objects could be a performance in the case of unless you need to modify the value of the variable you pass a the reason is that take more computation time than since with the program needs to look up in a table to find the of the when this time is shorter than the copying references are an and have the same byte length in so the time of copying an as a return value for a function is equivalent to the time of copying an but in the case where an is no look up is therefore performance is

 poster is you cannot return multiple values from a you do have a couple of a structure that contains multiple an instance of a output parameters the or a dictionary or pair as pros and cons here are often hard to figure if you return a make sure small because structs are value type and passed on the if you return an instance of a there are some design patterns here that you might want to use to avoid causing problems members of classes can be modified because passes objects by reference have byval like you did in you can use output parameters but i would limit the use of this to scenarios when you only have a couple 3 or of parameters otherwise things get ugly and hard to the use of output parameters can be an inhibitor to agility because your method signature will have to change every time you need to add something to the return value whereas returning a struct or class instance you can add members without modifying the method an architectural standpoint i would recommend against using pairs or i find this style of coding requires in code that consumes the it must know ahead of time what the keys are going to be and what the values mean and if the developer working on the internal implementation changes the way the dictionary or kvp is it could easily create a failure cascade throughout the entire

 power of two number can be represent in binary with a single 1 and multiple you subtract 1 from any power of two you will get all 1s to the right of where the original one 1 these two numbers will give you 0 every the case of a of two subtracting one will leave at least one unchanged somewhere in the number 1 these two will result in	
 powerbuilder ide but i think developing completely outside the powerbuilder ide is a good i think there are just too many dependencies right the ide for powerbuilder 12 will be built using visual studio isolated shell so it ought to be much better when that is i believe be doing away with the pbl format which ought to make source control much easier to work something to

 practice found very helpful is the idea of making your test suite to the code being that means that the tests are arranged in the same order as the lines of code they are this makes it very easy to take a piece of code and the test suite for that look at them and step through each line of code to verify there is an appropriate i have also found that the mere act of enforcing isomorphism like this forces me to think carefully about the code being such as ensuring that all the possible branches in the code are exercised by or that all the loop conditions are given code like cacheinfo if mcacheinfo test suite for this function would have the following in	
 practices for speeing up your web from yahoo includes the following users request a it can take anywhere from 200 to 500ms for the backend server to stitch together the html during this the browser is idle as it waits for the data to in php you have the function it allows you to send your partially ready html response to the browser so that the browser can start fetching components while your backend is busy with the rest of the html the benefit is mainly seen on busy backends or light good place to consider flushing is right after the head because the html for the head is usually easier to produce and it allows you to include any css and javascript files for the browser to start fetching in parallel while the backend is still js content the point at which the flush occurs here is after the head tag is this makes a lot of sense so the browser can begin loading images and scripts while the remainder of the page is rendered and there a way to flush after the head any other part of the explicitly using i flush the buffer early using

 prefixing or suffixing classes is an need to communicate that it is participating in a you create a custom to communicate if something is an abstract base torn on that last i like seeing the base but really hard for a consumer of your api to know that they instantiate filter trying it based on the i have no love for but a convention that i jon suffixing custom delegates with is common filtereventargs although a delegate declaration a class per it can cause name collission so should probably be stated

 presume with each news item get a list of strings that are the supposed from the structure you can only have one tag on each news that seems but the below applies your tags table has an index on the searches will be really and the database will take care of the caching so worry about the be amazed how much the database can speed things up when you have indexes in the right a select from tags where tag whatever1 this for each each time if no rows returned insert otherwise use the id found to do run the proc on each	
 presume you want to do this in that this is highly dependent on what programming language using which language would it i have used this code before in allows a modifier i think is which treats the and the string it is being matched as a is that the whole string is checked for validity each time you do allow control codes apart from new space so i also added a way to check for those here returns true if this is a valid false if allowcontrolcodes is false then most c0 codes below well as c1 codes will be denied recommend false for if return return true way would be to use the which is available in many the dom document object has a loadxml method which loads the document from an xml formatted this will fail if the document you input is not valid according to whatever character encoding it has but specifically enforce but if it was successful you can then check the property of the document object to see what encoding it	
 pretty as long as types remain unchanged their public or protected and method signatures are not changed methods or types is the jit should be able to link the dll just i think that even if it work you do make a new version and use a policy to map the old version to the new if otherwise you drive yourself straight back to dll and pretty sure you want

 pretty much an apache httpd noob so please bare with have an issue with serving a large amount of virtualhosts and i was wondering if there is a more efficient way of doing currently using the location directive to serve a large amount projects from different over 300 projects from 19 departments in the structures is the same for every location directive except for the directories the files are served what i currently have is a large file that looks something like servername authtype basic authname invitation authuserfile require authtype basic authname invitation authuserfile require authtype basic authname invitation authuserfile require you can see all these structures are the same except for the what i would like is of course something where i can use variables for the department and project names and just maintain a single location i assume that this is also less heavy on the server and servername authtype basic authname invitation authuserfile require help is very much apache serve multiple directories through single	
 pretty much just moved the body of the loop into the incrementer you can the for loop as a while loop to get some idea of what it is var position from 0 up to the current position var holder for swapping var loop through the j a lower x decrement the position and store that value in the temp copy position j to position copy the temp value that stored the old value at position i into position return first three are the initialzier expanded the check in the while is the stop condition and the body of the while is what was done in the incrementer portion of the corrected per

 previously used a not in the xp but in the sense that every task has a coder and a reviewer nominated before the coding the coder and reviewer work together identifying the correct solution so the reviewer knows what is meant to be done to perform the work is done in a branch by a single coder trunk and check in until the work has passed and a diff is generated for the whole if using something brain dead like a checkout per task is needed so changes for each task are if using something less brain dead not strictly the branch method works best because then the reviewer can generate their own diffs off the branch and no need to email them around you can check in works in progress without destroying the main a required state to your work flow in the issue tracker called one called when the dev has finished reviewing the code they can add their comments to the issue tracker and forward the ticket back to the developer for rework or merging depending on whether it worked if it worked well set it to the integration state and if it was bad put it back to process has worked reasonably well in all the places seen it

 principle still you are not going to have to worry about adding fields to tables etc until you have a lot of quite a lot of so worrying too much too early about the details of indexing and query plans without seeing actual data is going to often be wasted time and even lead to architectural problems mucking about with the database design after a production release can be pretty scary if a good process is not so even more so than you want to get it right first time with a you do want to plan for getting the data out as well as putting it in and storing so if your features include that will affect the design of the database a so maybe plan for is not as easy to tweak a schema as adding a but it is yagni still

 probably process the information in the log as it reads this means it have to allocate a huge amount of memory to store the it can read a process it and throw it it is a usual and very effective way to process could for example work line by line and parse each for the actual parsing you can write a state machine or if the requirements allows use approach would be a state machine that both reads and parses the if for some reason a log entry spans more than one line this might be state machine related simple state machine written in of python related but some sections are universally	
 probably the openquery causing is no information on how many no nothing so sql server will simply spool the results to allow it to evaluate the later bits i the basic suggest separating the creation and fill of the rewind is not rewind has nothing to do with the transaction sql server anticipating reuse of the which is because the openquery is a black near the bottom of this talk for you have a one something i found last week look at used with the openrowset rowset provider to import data into table without tablock multiple clients to concurrently data into the target table optimized logging and tablock on your we had some fun with a client developer using sqlbulkcopy giving very bad this not

 problem in your original code was that you were adding an to the but when you read a value out of the list you assigned the pointer directly to another so you had was was essentially a value stored in an delphi generally allows you to assign the untyped type to any including fix your original you would need to write the second look something like i 0 to do p if not f if not were right to call in your first when the reference count on the result is because the value stored in the loop is a not the actual you need to increment the reference count because is going to be for other since the reference manually counting is stored in the it would be better to call inside instead of waiting until it you clear the or as you remove items from the you would need to call on all the interface gives the better use to store a list of simply suited to the task by final piece of the prefix on names is used to denote interfaces have method implementations of their shown the implementation of so clearly an interface it should be named or maybe

 problem is better solved with a combination of good communication of a system model and favor of the confirmation mechanism speaks the simplicity of from point of view the easiest way of shifting responsibility onto asked you if you really want to shoot yourself into the now there is no one to blame but user point of is a productivity penalty of having to confirm operation twice every time even though actual mistakes take up just a fraction of total number of any switching of breaking the habitual workflow or inserting a pause into confirmation just increases the mechanism really provide much safety net for frequent users whose reflexes work ahead of the concious personally i have many times done a complex sequence of actions only to realise a moment later when observing the consequences that my brain somehow took the wrong better for the but more complex software development point of solution would possible communicate in advance what exact affect the action is going to make on the system instance stack overflow shows message preview above post your answer an immediate feedback to confirm once the action took place highlights the freshly submitted gmail displayes a confirmation when a message is sent to undo or correct possible mistake in so case delete or edit the windows lets restore a file from recycle bin for certain actions still possible to give an undo capability but for a limited timeframe only letting to cancel or change an online order during the first 10 minutes after its or letting to recall an during the first 60 seconds after its been but actually queued in the outbox this is much more initial work than inserting a confimation message but instead of shifting the responsibility it attempts to solve the

 problem is generally a one in terms of computational in fact it rings some bells in the back of my head that it probably reduces to one of those classic algorithm problems like the but i attach a proper name to with such a small problem space can only pick 10 it should be fairly quick to just the when someone submits a custom just recursively attack it with all possibilities and see which one is the take the components and first try to remove the components of from if take the remaining components and try to take the components of from keep track of the best solution found so far as you go still not fast enough i think it probably will depending on how many packages you you could apply some methods to speed it to on the number of possibilities and how long this actually takes to you may want to write the code i described and then just go ahead and all the solutions for every possible then when someone submits a custom you just have to fetch the answer instead of computing it from scratch every if you want to them suggest storing the result every time someone does a custom then in the future if anyone else does the same custom build you have to recalculate the	
 problem is just that the is being captured rather than the a solution which is much the but slightly if newlastgetter return no need to create a new delegate instance delegates are so you can just copy the value with really a problem in terms of the value being captured a common problem for anonymous methods and lambda expressions in the typical example actions new i action in prints 10 to print you again need to change the scope of the captured actions new i int copy action in

 problem is that it gives the wrong impression it makes it look like the value when actually only the value that rather than the i think the code analysis is being overly cautious here there are plenty of places where you might want a mutable type stored in a readonly particularly if initialized in a static initializer and then never mutated within your the field is more of a risk of derived classes abusing personally i like all my fields to be on the other i know your code it could be that weighed that up against the possibilities and decided the right thing to really is less to worry other than the general impression of immutability given by the fact that the field is disable the warning for that and add a comment to emphasize that the object is mutable even though the field is	
 problem is that jtextarea uses a different default font than i had the same problem in an application i wrote that had to support reason for your problem is that jtextarea is normally used to show a such as courier normally java contains no additional mappings for a graphical font to display fix you have because there is no font named so the default is taken the font is internally mapped to a font family in the file of your this will be the same font that jtextfield have the following to ensure that the same font definition is used in all graphical you can also find the specific key for jtextarea and change this way you have to worry about the fonts of any they will be initialized with fontdefinition new new new new keys object key object value if instanceof

 problem is that the data keeps writing to the osream again and how to stop it when all the data is this is the danger of thinking in the passive reword the question in the active problem is that the data keeps writing to the osream again and how to stop it when i have sent all the you have almost answered your own large part of the problem is your what a complete jpeg representation of the image the length of the representation the first portion of the representation are three problems and you need to solve all the jpeg representation the length of the representation only track of what you have already sent and only send the first part of what you do all put the length into an nsmutabledata and append the jpeg representation to retain this new data and have additional instance variables for the bytes pointer and the length do all this you get to the when you do get to separately send the because put it into the data you need only send the bytes from your pointer instance variable with the length remaining as the max after you check that the number of bytes sent was not 0 or add it to the pointer and subtract it from the length the length remaining reaches you have sent assuming you want to follow the jpeg data up with you can then close the	
 problem is that the joins between and and need to happen in all that you programs and match against in boolean and or match against in boolean and because in your first query you can ignore those parenthesis everything is together and the tables join up in your second not what the database is really taking the rows in and crossing that with the rows in therefore normally you use joins i to limit that to a linear list of valid in your query you allow row to match instead of matching so for each row in one table that matches also selecting the rows in the other

 problem with inheritance is that the focus on the language mechanism makes people think about implementation rather than b inherits from it means that every instance of b is also an instance of in being an instance of something means typically that you should have a sensible response to its methods and at least support their you feel that b should not support one of the messages of then as far as i am concerned you have two throw an exception as you would get with the collections this is in my opinion poor accept that b is not a type of a and avoid the or restructure it using composition so that you have to rewrite the code but you do not use a subtyping if your application will live over you want to have semantic issues in your

 professional apps are in your you would probably layer it like the two distinct depending on how complex the app the service other layers to support client the database store would be something like some tables in an oracle or microsoft sql and would on your layer would be your code that retrieves and stores data your it might also contain business which are basically classes that have properties representing your data from your the benefit of the data access layer is that sometimes reading and writing to a database can require specialized and you want that code sprinkled throuought your so instead you can call functions in your data access layer that loads needed data into so the rest of your application is just interacting with a regular old these are called which stands for something like plan old clr there are lots of variations on this of as people have taken different approaches to the problem of isaloting database also it serves the purpose of minimizing breaking changes whenever the database since the database access logic is not sprinkled throughout the then there are fewer places that need to be updated if the database changes as adding new columns to a table or changing a the business layer will be own and would contain most of the of the it would sit between the data access and web service using concepts from service oriented architecture you might have an authentication and a web request handling these services are a lot like a class that is always there waiting to process your web request handling service would take a and maybe first call into the authentication service to verify credentials before honoring the soa is one of those things i think should be used only when it some cases just using object oriented techniques will give you the same not always when done is more so it really depends on whether soa offers you additional benefits that you webservice would be responsible for receiving requests from the and acting on those requests by making calls into your business layer to update or retrieve the concept here would be that you could have many users of your service who publish their song updates through your client would have a service layer which would be responible for formatting requests into sending them to the web and retrieving messages from the web you would put very little application in your web service all this is probably overkill and inefficient for what you are wanting to do since you just want something for but the basic anatomy of a lot of webservice applications and would be a good learning the whole purpose of the layers is decoupling and while more makes the application overall more it means each component is this means easier to wrap your head around problems when you are only dealing with one component which interacts with only a couple other sourounding so there is a careful balance between few components and many too few and they become monolithic and difficult to too and they become intertwined in complex i have heard it said something along the lines of a class is getting too big and too then split it up into a few more in start subdividing stuff for the heck of it just because it sounds like the right thing to evaluate how complex your component is going to be before deciding if you want to split it sometimes for simple cases your have a layer serving more than one for the sake of getting it done faster and making the overall design the point apply these concepts where you will learn what is appropriate with and you obviously understand that you can learn the most by vbscript call a com you can compile dlls with com many older things can call com vbscript got script and that safe to your webservice will be where you would be most concerned with safe only if you design with security in mind and screw we all screw up sometimes which means there is no guarantee of it being perfectly

 programming language has specific ways of handling relies a lot on so you might wanna check everything you learn about concurrency should apply whatever the os or language there are roughly 4 problems you must learn to directly related to your questions but these are subjects you should learn in parallel to learning a particular syntax in a given java is of course quite easy while might be a little your are also a number of known for synchronizing threads such list goes on and but are basically helping or variables that will help you solve the 4 problems

 projects have a development phase where active adding of new features occurs concurrently with bug and a stage where feature set is frozen and of the work goes towards bringing the critical bugs count to 0 fixing as many bugs until a fixed deadline as so the answer would depend on the stage your project is i i also make my best effort to claim at least one feature to work on at the same or encountering a particularly buggy block of request a mandate to refactor the entire thus i get to do some new development face most of us prefer to write new stuff to fixing the while reducing the bug

 put it the other way you might be risking overcomplicating something that is ridiculously simple being a bit as others are pointing is really just a minimal set of language extensions to when you are writing you are actually writing you can even access the internal machinations of the runtime support using some handy c functions that are part of the language i recommend you actually do this unless you really know what the only time ever had mildly tricky moments is when i wanted to pass an instance method as a callback to a c for using a cross platform library that has functions which accept a i might call the function from within an object instance to process some and then want that c function to call my instance back when its or as part of getting additional input etc etc common paradigm in this can be done with funky function and some other creative methods and if you ever need to do it googling method for c or something like that will give you the only other word of advice is to make sure your objects appropriately manage any manually memory that they create for use by c want your classes to tidy up that memory on dealloc it is than dust off any reference on c and have

 python project has a component which is compiled and distributed as a file inside a python noticed that it seems to be incompatible with only some of our our brand new 64 bit windows we have 4 identically provisioned machines each of them runs windows 2003 server 64 bit but 2 of these machines do not allow me to call functions in the some experimentation i was able to find a recipe for a reproducible the problem seems to occur when python tries to import the pyd copied the pyd to a temp folder and ran from that incidentally we are still using the 32bit edition of python since none of our libraries have been ported to 64 bit architecture next i try to import my module the first time i try this i get an error dll load the specified module could not be time i try this the python interpreter crashes no stacktrace at you are suspecting my pyd the odd thing about this is that already in use on thousands of pcs and 10s of other many of which are identical 64 bit the project is continuously tested both in development and after so if this thing were so unstable have known about it a very long time this component is considered to be stable code so surprising that breaking so suggestions to what i can do to debug this troublesome crazy ideas welcome at this point because exhausted all the sensible okay using process monitor i was able to compare one 64bit server that fails with another that works just i found that the breakage seems to occur due to a missing any idea what this component is and where i can get i can refer this back to our it provisioning people who can install does this pyd file not import on some

 question is a bit as it sounds like you want to get all of the original sequence but then you have both 4 and 8 mapping to and nothing mapping to you actually meant that to be a then what you are looking for is a random permutation of the original there are ways to do this with or without collecting up the set first need something that generates or keep track of where you note that n is not you can always use and then add n to everything if interpreted this correctly and you are actually looking for a shuffle algorithm random called shuffles by analogy to shuffling a deck of have a look at based on your the problem you face is you want to encode the permutation but you must encode it somehow in order to construct the easiest way is just to actually store the permuted indices in an but if you want to do that for some reason too you can encode it in various there is no free lunch as there are information theoretic limits on how simple this can you can get some ideas from looking up work on for example something like

 question is long winded because i have been updating the question over a very long time trying to get ssis to properly export excel managed to solve this although not aside from someone providing a correct the solution listed in this question is not only answer i found was to create a row named wide enough for my in the named range sample data and hide appends the data and reads metadata from the single is close enough for it to drop stuff in data takes the format of the hidden single this allows what a pain in the it will take over 450 days of exports to recover the time i still love ssis and will continue to use it because it is still way better than filemaker my next attempt will be doing the same thing in the report question you are in sql server integrations services designer and want to export data to an excel file starting on something other than the first lets say the forth how do you specify tried going in to the excel destination of the data changed the accessmode to openrowset from then set the variable to this fails saying it cannot find the the sheet is called thought you could specify in excel you can select a set of cells and name them with the name this allows you to select the name instead of the sheet without the dollar oddly whatever the range you it appends the data to the next row after the as you add it increases the named row odd thing is the data takes the format of the last line of the range my header rows are if i specify a range that ends with the header the data appends to the row and makes all the entries if you specify one row it puts a blank line between the header row and the but the data is not matter what i ssis samples the of the file and sets the metadata according to what it if you have sample data that has a value of zero but is formatted as the first it treats that column as text and inserts numeric values with a single quote in front i also tried headers that do not reflect the data types of the i tried changing the metadata of the excel but it always changes it back when i run the then fails saying it will truncate if i tell it to ignore it imports everything except that days of several hours a piece tried every a mostly working example is to create the named range starting with the column format your column headers as you want the data to look as the data takes on this in my these exist from a4 to which is my defined ssis appends to the row after the defined so defining a4 to e68 appends the rows starting at you define the connection as having the first row contains the field it takes on the metadata of the header not the second and it guesses at the data not the formatted data type of the headers are so all my metadata is if your headers are so is all of your even tried making a sample data row without i think anyone actually uses excel with the default ms ssis you could define the to with no header row and format those columns not without it skipping a row in this would be very from what i noone uses ssis to export excel without a third party connection ideas on how to set this up properly so that data is formatted the metadata read from excel is proper to the real and formatting inherits from the first row of not the headers in last update got this to work very one thing i added to excel was the in the excel connection this forces excel to look at all rows to see what kind of data is in this does not drop say for instance if you have a zip code then about 9 rows down you have a excel without this blanks that field entirely without with it recognizes that zip is actually a character field instead of of one more update will succeed importing data with missing contents in the first 8 but it will fail exporting data where no data have it on your import connection but not your export excel connection have to after so much it works pretty if you are using a x64 bit make sure you call the dtexec from sql it will load the 32 bit excel driver and work to export ssis to microsoft excel without additional	
 question is only looking for on the direction of mvc as a i truly am not posting it as my company is planning a major web application investment and we need to decide if mvc is the right head of posted this on his mvc is a microsoft product enables developers to easily build applications using as long as the above statement is true then mvc is safe to deploy mvc is released under the public is an open source the contains no platform restrictions and provides broad rights to modify and redistribute the source microsoft released mvc under open source licensing my first thought was that ms might soon drop support for and with that thought i want to invest in mastering it for obvious could be so i wanted to get some feedback before making any solid this a good friend asked a compelling question about this is mvc open source or shared that got me thinking about the difference between open initiatives and the open source if you open and this difference really gets at the niggling concern over microsoft open sourcing an important not that having access to the source is that is i wish we had access to win32 or even the entire source code for talk about solving problems the concern is over whether ms will now take a posture towards in that case i know if we should use it as it could take awhile for robust community support to build around a source collection originally owned by a company not generally known for giving away source mvc is now is this a good

 question relates to question on jena ontmodel i have jena models on two machines that need to remain synchronized over the main issue that i need to address is that the models may contain anonymous nodes which can originate in any of the am i on the right track or is there a more robust approach that failing to can think of 3 approaches to this the complete this is prohibitively expensive for synchronizing small since changes can occur on either i just replace machine model with the serialized model from machine i need to merge a partial use a dedicated model for serialization that only contains the changes that need to be sent over the this approach requires special vocabulary to represent statements that were from the when i serialize the model from machine a to machine anonymous node ids will be unique to machine a but may overlap with ids for anonymous nodes created on machine have to rename anonymous nodes and keep a mapping from machine anon ids to machine ids in order to handle future changes individual this approach requires no special but may not be as are there issues other than anonymous nodes that i just encountered globally unique bnode ids we can generate globally unique ids for anonymous nodes by prefixing the id with a unique machine i figured out to tell jena to use my id instead of its this would allow us to serialize individual statements without remapping bnode an example to ground this discussion a bit suppose i have a list on machine a represented serialize this model from machine a to machine because machine b may already have an anonymous node with id i remap id to a new id the list changes on machine machine b has never encountered machine id it adds a new mapping from machine id to a new id problem is further complicated with more than two if there is a third machine for it may have own anonymous node that is different from machine anonymous node machine b really does need to keep a map from each of the other anonymous node ids to its local not just from remote ids in general to local when processing incoming it must take into account where the changes came from to map the ids jena ontmodels with

 quicksort is often a better choice than merge there are definitely times when merge sort is thereotically a better the most obvious time is when extremely important that your algorithm run faster than quicksort is usually faster than but given the theoretical worst possible it could run in which is worse than the worst possible merge is also more complicated than especially if you want to write a really solid and so if aiming for simplicity and merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance

 read and find the concept of virtual library interfaces nice for runtime loading of however it seems that they available for is this and if i see what would tie the idea to mostly rephrasing here what rob already not after plugins or similar about plain old win32 what appeals to me is the idea to let the compiler deal with all the details of loading a dll at runtime no need to call getprocaddress for every function in the dll library interfaces for

 read most questions on stackoverflow with regards to but i am still not sure whether i have to override on reference i picked up the following from someones answer in another uses an field in the class generate the hash each created is assigned a unique stored as an it these keys start at 1 increment every time a new object any type gets this is still true in framework someone please then the only problem i see with the default implementations of reference types is that the hash code will have a poor break my so it it recommended to override to if it is used in a or does the default implementation perform just i have reference types where it would be easy to do since they have fields that identify them uniquely but what about those reference types where all members are also reference what should i do i need to override on reference

 real if you kill a process instant no chance to clean windows reboots often close a program by sending it a but it always work for whatever if your program delays for very the user if he wants to save before for the shutdown code will kill the if you want to guarantee that always call that event have to guarantee that you never use a modal dialog box or anything else that would block the program from immediately bailing out when it receives this is probably more trouble than alternative would be to do something similar to what firefox write the status data out to a temporary file while still and then when it check to see if that there and if the data indicates still in an if your program can know that its last incarnation got killed somehow and take whatever action is such as updating the status log whatever with the last available

 really are a couple things going on first thing you should look at is something like a compilers there are several old like the famous that are very i just discovered another one from the same guy who wrote the of assembly language on to write great only read the sample chapters so but it looks good and also seems to address just what you want without dropping immediately into the wonders of grammars and so is more programming in a systems programming you learn about using various system calls and other stuff to build useful you need to know that but a different track than it computer organization like the one aaronis refers is more about how the program gets from the assembly language level to actual gates and also called as the phrase was used when and brooks invented the instruction how and how you make quantitative choices in the design of the	
 really depends on the goal of your course teaching programming and teaching computer science are two separate and though they are not mutually introductory classes generally do not teach both equally an example of the say we want to learn how to sort a a programming course in would teach you to use the syntax of a function and homework might be writing several comparison a computer science course would explain to you what a merge sort what the algorithm looks like in and its and homework would be writing the sort function if you are teaching introductory then you should teach your students about you are teaching computer then there is no need to understand pointers at an introductory

 really do because arrays in c are stored such that the elements of each row are stored that means a row of an array is a continuous block of and as far as c is concerned it might as well be an independent array it work the same way with columns because the elements of a column are not continuous in rather they are spaced at intervals of where each row is bytes this means that you could efficiently access the various of a column of a 2d array by using pointer but no way to actually make a column into an array itself other than by copying the elements over into a new	
 really do it for all modes as there are indentation but you can set it it for all of the languages you care for something akin to the following in your should work for what you will set up tab stops at 4 characters and make 4 the default indentation level for all for other languages and their respective you have to look up their indentation variables and set them accordingly in that common some examples include and the easiest way to figure out what needs to be set is to should send you down the rabbit	
 really have a in that it has and symbols lispers call but it really doing it the way that article in answer to your it so much that ruby has the same thing done but rather that it does two different things notation unique ids and bindings in and uses similar overlapping terminology for article you link to gives the conventional definition of a symbol to each identifier in a source code is associated with information relating to its declaration or appearance in the such as its scope level and sometimes its this what symbol table it just provides a globally unique identity for a certain class of objects which can be written as in the source including things like and which merely using an identifier will not create a corresponding and none of the information listed in the passage above is stored in list of a coincidence of and reading that article will not help you understand	
 really idisposable from some classes need to be like and the most efficient way is to do it in the method to avoid the overhead of but this method must be called so exactly as in your example the classes that encapsulate or contain idisposable have to dispose so they have to be disposable as the only way to avoid it is using idisposable classes where lock or wait for events in single keep expensive resources in single them only when you need them and dispose them just after some cases idisposable can be ignored because it supports an optional for waithandle implements idisposable to support a named if a name is not being the dispose method does memorystream is another it uses no system resources and its dispose implementation also does careful thinking about whether an unmanaged resource is being used or not can be so can examining the available sources for the libraries or using a

 really is a loaded the biggest issue you are probably facing is that has a terrible separation of concerns regarding backend and another thing that i would not be suprised to hear is that your html developers cringe when they see server control generated really does have some interesting this suggestion then may offer you no but this is what our company has and we were in the same boat as switched to an mvc your best choices in are of course the new mvc and mvc web frameworks allow a loose coupling between server logic and which allows you to create less standards because have much less crosstalk in your html developers will simply receive the data the page requires and then will be able to frame their markup around making it entirely possible that they not need to write any server and your server side developers will not need to create the biggest reason for diving into others code is to do something you need to do but as if you simplify your connection to be simple classes passed to the markup this crosstalk should be we as a company realized a much higher productivity level by switching to

 really odds are if your program is this the it should be noted that you make a completely equal is more similar to this example will use it it qstring your code macro is able to do this by using some compiler extensions to get the type of the container also imagine that is very similar in reason why your example fair is that your version is adding extra are indexing instead of really if you are using a type with allocation suspect this might be the case with then indexing will be more expensive since the code has to calculate the item are indexing using the function instead of this function is usually implemented in such a way that is more expensive than this because least the are required to do bounds checking in this all indexes are in and potentially throw an does not have this requirement it is legal for it to do the bounds but that make sense in practice because that goes against being it the timing difference between those two pieces of code will be negligible if existent at waste your time worrying about write whichever you find more clear and as a currently i strongly favor the version of container it is concise and you code	
 really only one best be aware that strings and bytes are two fundamentally different and that whenever you convert between you are using a character encoding implicitly or which you need to pay attention problematic spots in the java api of these implicitly use the platform default which depends on the os and the locale a good idea to avoid this and explicitly declare an encoding in the above cases unfortunately so you have to use an your problems with the quotation marks and your use of a template engine may have a much simpler what program are you using to write your it sounds like one that inserts which are part of the cp1251 encoding but exist in the more global you probably need to do is to be aware which encoding your templates are saved and configure your template engine to use that encoding when reading in the also be aware that some texxt specifically explicitly declare the encoding in a and if that header disagrees with the actual encoding used by the invariable run into

 recent versions of sql execution plans are cached for stored procedures and parametrized the query will have a one time cost to create the execution but this will be very minor and lost in the overhead of even a few a performance perspective they will be almost exception to is if you are doing recursive or nested queries each row in query execute query where the round trips between the client and server will add in this a proc will be much companies still have as a but this is usually due to control of the database and not performance as linq grows in this may your application has a single points of then use whichever you on the other if you are deploying to many many then stored procs can in some not cases allow you to update database functionality without redeploying the client

 remember the old effective approach of studying a new it was always the best way to read a good book on the say when i tried to skip a lot of material to speed up coding it turned out later that it would be quicker to read the whole book there was no good ways to study a framework in small or at least i did not see them last years a lot of new things improved search results from programming much more people involved in internet a lot of open source now when we write software we much often depend on open and a lot of times we need to know only a small amount of their functionality to use just about finding the simplest way of using a small subset of the library without unnecessary do you do to study as less as possible of the framework and still use it suppose you need to index a set of documents with and you need to highlight search you care about storing the index in one file multiple fuzzy queries and a lot of other stuff that is going to occupy your brain if you study lucene in what are your tricks to save your will enumerate what i would though i feel that my process can be highlight and so try to estimate trust score of unofficial articles blog posts based on publishing the number and the tone of the if there is no a definite answer collect new search keywords and links on the for really quick newbie guides on official how valuable are javadocs for a highlight package for simple examples that come with a related to what you study about lucene search highlighting in lucene mail you can get no answer or even get a bad reputation if you ask a silly and often you know whether you question is silly because you have not studied the framework in it on stackoverflow or other qa service you give me a working example of search keywords highlighting in however this question is very specific and can gain no answers or a bad how easy to get the answer from the framework code if open are your search write them in priority order if strategies for studying libraries

 seeing is a bit of legacy code showing its the heart of the matter is the visual basic used the type for its boolean true for a is represented with the value which has the integer value during the conversion to it was decided that when using visual basic conversion routines to convert a boolean value to an integer visual basic semantics would be maintained on the return it would be first implicit conversion occurs with the b i under the hood this does an implicit conversion from integer to any value is deemed to be therefore the resulting value is the following line of code is doing an implicit conversion to an integer the hood this uses one of the visual basic conversion routines or to convert the value to an as such visual basic semantics are in play and the value returned is next interesting line is the this is using a conversion routine which does not use visual basic it returns the underlying representation for a true boolean value which is

 several parts to this i really know that how they affect my cert is like icing on the but nobody just wants to eat the best thing on your then a for if fresh out of college and you have zero then these certifications show that learned a technology new and colleges teach the same information footprint that these certs cover college degrees are great for the theory behind what and the certs are a little more applicable to what doing as a developer or dba on that particular not as good as real if 2 years of database development or then that probably trumps a cert in most of my not going to matter if you have the choice between doing four weekends of consulting versus four weekends of studying for the then going to make more out of the in the certs will raise your billable but if even asking that not at the point of your career where this is going to make a go ask your manager what they wish they could accomplish in the next two tell willing to take on their pet project in your side time to help both of deliver some new piece of some new clean up a save them whatever it and be more likely to get a raise than if you go get a when picking side pick something that you can put on your licensing costs by through a successful server consolidation says a lot more to employers than they truly that are easy to get are not some certs the microsoft certified are the ones you can get in a few weekends of studying not so they make differences in your but the studying that you do to prepare for these exams will make a difference in your in the course of learn tricks and features that you can leverage in your your position before and after you get you think going to get a raise simply by showing your on the wrong ask your manager for a frank and honest evaluation of your tell them that you want to make sure your career keeps and that like their advice on what you should do if you like your ask your mentor find a programmer already doing what you wish you were and ask how they got probably not by getting a	
 several pieces i agree with although i completely rather be able to write my code in emacs bt one of the things about smalltalk is that it really is very unforgiving of people who want to do things the smalltalk in this the smalltalk way is to use the part of the reason that this is the smalltalk way is that smalltalk in a lot of not other there is for all practical no way to make a smalltalk all you can do is make an image of smalltalk with some relatively small fragments of your own code added when you write code using an external as with the syntax you literally just hand typing an format that is somewhat easier to hand type than but only moral do it the smalltalk with the are some fairly good tutorials for smalltalk i usually use so the ones seen are using as in luck because smalltalk was the first place to get for called and a good tutorial using assertions there in what appears to be basically a by there has been work done on adding design by contract to as for simple you can add code as in so ablock an assertion error if ablock does not evaluates to ablock

 short answer is the long answer is there any great classes exposed to manipulate rich text items in however a few that you can research are the and notesrichtexttable to name a these classes help you define some rich text elements and add them programmatically to your rich text since sending is to use the notesmimeentity classes and build the email using html way some sample s new docmail as body as stream as db false do not convert mime to rich email to be docmail send to from from reply to set stream body html code goes used because of technote found on docmail body stream true restore need to turn the convertmime setting off in the then create a new set the mail that part is already in your vba create the mimeentity and a stream to hold your html finally call the setcontentfromtext method on your mimeentity then send your note the last call is to turn the convertmime feature back on for the not sure if this will all work via but it does work well in lotusscript agents in hope this

 solution is to use a licensing technology with a this is a small device that plugs into usb or another port on the and serves as a physical key to activate the third solution is to provide a that when the software starts it queries a server on the network on the lan or else accessed at your company via the that validates that the usage of the software is this is a good solution for so customers can install your software on many but you license it for simultaneous use on a limited number of is an example of a license management mac address of the network card is the solution i used last time i worked for a company that licensed software to run on a specific i want to offer a if you do this type of you have to anticipate that become an administrative to track your once you have a few hundred be amazed at how frequently you get phone calls with requests to change upgraded our server to a network and now the work because the new adapter a different mac else the customers may replace their whole and need an updated license to run your software on the new we got these calls practically every day at the company i worked also need to trust the customer to stop using your software on the old computer network if you give them a new if you trust them to obey the license in the first how can you trust that throw away the old you plan how going to support this administrative license your product in this only inconvenience your good who would have cooperated	
 solution is wrong because the methods are your even but if you add delimiters and set multiline it will work modifier allows to match the beginning of a logical line rather than just the beginning of the whole the anchor is necessary because without it the regex would match the newline at the end of every not just the blank you need the anchor because actively matching the newline but it gets the job but more complicated than it needs to the regex has to match either the beginning of the string multiline mode not or at least one newline followed by at least one newline in the special case of a string that starts with one or blank be replaced with blank pretty sure not the desired what it does most of the time is replace two or more consecutive along with any horizontal whitespace or that lies between with one the the author seems to expect to match just the space character when in fact it matches any whitespace a very common the actual list varies from one regex flavor to the but at minimum you can expect to match whatever in php you have a better matches any horizontal whitespace and matches vertical live demos and the site keeps changing back to so select the tab at the top to see it

 solution should you could also keep your links in the views pointed to evaluate the incoming object and then the appropriate controller based on the object unless performing completely different actions with each type of then wind up with duplicate code in your so you might be better off sticking with the pages controller and just adding some methods that handle the extra lookups that are needed for that

 solved this problem by chaining the use of an air html control in conjunction to use of swfloader to then load the desired remote wrote a javascript function on an html web page that my air app loads into an html instance the page complete event it is then safe to call the javascript function from air flex code the flex code of handle the html complete javascript function uses to login to the web site that uses spring security for a header gets processed upon a successful when the response for the is complete then a synthetic click event is dispatched on a dummy div object that has been placed on the web air flex code is able to register for and process this synthetic click processing the click the air flex code then knows it is safe to proceed to instantiate a swfloader when the complete event from the swfloader object then the object reference of the swfloader is placed in the air app display user then sees the remotely loaded swf file begin to execute and show its own it is running in a remote sandbox the feature is supported in flex sdk via the swfloader the air app is managing the cookie header that was established by the html that cookie header is emitted in the http request of the swfloader control when it is used to load the remote spring security filter sees this and finds the request to be from an authenticated user

 some more details of what environment you are using difficult to be but a few of pointers to things that can easily go wrong when setting up sure you have the camera set up to look at point you are drawing the this can be surprisingly and the simplest approach is to implement glutlookat from the opengl utility make sure you front and back planes are set to sensible off backface at least to start sure with production code backface culling gives you a quick performance but remarkably easy to set up normals incorrectly on an object and not see it because looking at the invisible to call glflush to make sure that all commands are drawing to the back buffer then failing to call glswapbuffers is also a common you can run into issues with buffer formats although if you copy from sample code that works on your system this is less likely to be a coding tends to be quite straightforward to debug once you have the basic environment correct because the output is but setting up the rendering environment on a new system can always be a bit tricky until you have that first cube or sphere i would recommend obtaining a sample or template and modifying that to start with rather than trying to set up the rendering window from using glut to check out first drafts of opengl calls is good technique

 sounds like you want to have the delegate methods received by multiple on mac os the solution is to use the notification i looked at the but it looks like it only supports a delegate out of the are great because they let an object broadcast information to any other objects that are interested in receiving objects register themselves with the notification center to be notified when particular notifications are you could very easily add this capability by implementing your own class to wrap what write your own class that has an as an instance you would set this class as the delegate for the when the delegate methods get you would post notifications to the probably need to stuff the parameters from the delegate methods into the the flip your view controllers would sign up with the as observers for the notifications your custom class every time the delegate methods each view controller will receive a notification of that some nsstring mysocketwrapper nsobject give this class a better name asyncsocket the asyncsocketdidreaddata if return socket initialize this however you return nsdictionary in your various view you can write code like if return do any initalization you need note that if you specify for be sent notifications for every mysocketwrapper return asyncsocket nsdata long tag do what you want with the data this code entirely and i may have gotten some method names wrong doing this from but this is a solution that should work for

 sounds like your main complaint so much with the abstraction of but with the language syntax for using prefer something like style this is the then the java language has relatively little to offer direct field access is until you need to switch to a getter or and then you will have some refactoring to do if you control the whole if the java platform is a but the language then there are other scala has a very nice property for along with lots of other features that could be useful for such a and best of it runs on the so you still get the same portability that get by writing it in the java	
 sounds like your primary concern how does the compiler know how much to allocate in the array if the size changes at answer is that it allocates the maximum amount of space note that this is for space in when the record is written to a only the relevant portion is pic table occurs 1 to 9 times depending on 03 fld1 pic will allocate 36 characters multiplied by for in working if is set to 2 when the record is written to a only 8 characters will be written and above the characters written for of when the record is read back both and the relevant bits of will be populated from the i believe that the unused entries are initialized to anything when that best to assume not and populate them explicitly if you need to add another item to the you may want to consider setting the to is

 statements are very rarely necessary in in you can just use objects like and do the lookup is equivalent to for is equivalent to which can also be written as f you need in order to select a variable or call a function dynamically based on its in when doing you should prefer to store the function in an object rather than at global scope in the assuming that and are fundamentally different and be combined into a generic you could do something like the following without changing your code var action if in if in else action in context else context in better is to refactor things to have have these functions be methods of objects for each like

 straight answer is that the behaviour of the wildcard characters is dependent on the ansi query mode of the interface being query mode uses the query mode server compatibility uses the these modes are specific to and bear only a passing resemblance to the and ado interface always uses query dao interface always uses query using odbc the query mode can be explicitly specified via the ms access user from the 2003 version can use either query so assume it is one or the other at any given time do not use wildcard characters in validation sql syntax has an which allows the query mode characters and regardless of the query mode of the however has the slight disadvantage of the keyword not being compatible remains highly the main is that i understand the keyword is not officially supported i imagine it will disappear or have altered behaviour anytime

 structure is just completely unsuited for but since you know you might be able to make some assumptions that help you tried working it in a manner similar to and i always got caught on the fact that you only have a binary piece of information or which for four you have possible but you only really have three branches 8 possible to store the swapped state you simply have a place to store this maybe you could write a traverser that goes through the tree and uses the number of leaves to determine how many swaps are and then goes through those swaps systematically instead of just leaving it to the tree each encode the permutation as a series of swaps from the run these swaps on the original do whatever processing is needed on the swapped might not be appropriate for your but you given that many details about why you need to do it the way doing the way doing it now simply since factorial number of grows faster than exponential number of bits you if you had 8 you would have 7 branches and 8 leaves for a total of 15 there are 40320 permutation of 8 and only 32768 possible combinations of 15 you simply cannot represent the

 suggest two methods of doing overlapped and ignore the third misunderstanding your you issue an overlapped a for you can specify an overlapped structure which contains an event and you can wait for that event to be signalled to indicate the overlapped has i is your approach as previously this scale well as limited to the number of handles that you can pass to you can pass a completion routine which is called when completion this is known as and requires that the thread that issued the call is in an state for the completion routine to be threads can put themselves in an alertable state in several ways or the various ex versions of the wait the that i have open in front of me says have worked with alertable quite a and be the first to tell you that alertable is horrible and should be enough said a third before issuing the call you should associate the handle that you want to do overlapped on with a completion you then create a pool of threads which service this completion port by calling and you issue your with an overlapped structure without an event in it and when the completes the completion pops out of on one of your pool threads and can be handled previously 2008 have cleaned up how iocps work a little and removed the problem whereby you had to make sure that the thread that issued the overlapped request continued to run until the request link to a reference to that can be found but this problem is easy to work around you simply marshal the wsarecv over to one of your pool threads using the same iocp that you use for imho using iocps is the best way to do overlapped getting your head around the nature of the calls can take a little time at the start but well worth it as the system scales very well and offers a simple and method of dealing with overlapped you need some sample code to get you going then i have several articles on writing io completion port systems and a heap of free code that provides a framework for high performance see an you really should read via by jeffrey richter and christophe nasarre as it deals will all you need to know about overlapped and most other advanced windows platform techniques and

 sure there are weighty against this bad have the wrong presumption that committing to the version control is a bad idea you wrongly phrased your it is is and very important to keep what you call in version more than you should also keep compilers and anything else used to transform the set of source files to a finished five years from certainly be using different compilers and different build that may happen to not be able to compile version of your for whatever what could be a simple small change to fix a bug in a legacy will transform into a nightmare of porting that old software to current compilers and build just to recompile a source file that had a there is no reason you should be so afraid of storing in version what you may want to do is to keep them in separate suggest separating them compilers go libraries go object files go sources go package1 sources go package2 sources go have to configure your ide or your build scripts to place object files in even recreating the directory structure under you give your users the option to checkout either to get the full building or to get the source of the and you must place the compilers and libraries that were used to compile the final the ones used to ship the software to the in 5 or 10 you will have them available for your use in some

 suspect that this will end up being a database design issue more than a query optimization the steps to analyze this query have all been outlined to consider the logic of your you may not need to run this query nearly as many times as you are or you may find that you need the data in the same format that currently producing allowing you to write a simpler and faster going to assume that you need this query generate the execution plan for the query for a sample the include execution plan button or for portions of the the execution plan that are taking a lot of and see if you can tie those back to a specific part of the this will give us the clues on where to focus our around with these portions of the query and see what you can come up thing that i can see that might help performance on the specifics of your is to try and force the order of data access to the dettaglioorarilinee for dettaglioorarilineeperiodi select idorario from where idorario in select idorario is still an inner from periodi where 0 as as and as as select as as as as over by order by as select from dettaglioorarilineeperiodi where idrellineestazionamenti as inner select idorario from dettaglioorarilineeperiodi where idrellineestazionamenti as on inner join on select idorario from where 0 or idgiorno on or as as and as as and or not in as as idorario from as as as as as 0 or idgiorno as row thing you could try would be replacing the or not in as as idorario from as or not like and not like and not like if you find anything that or you have a bunch of the next step would be to see if you can modify the indexes for these what recommend is loading sql profiler may need to install it from your sql and creating a new as soon as the trace has execute the operation that is taking too and then stop the save the trace to a and then launch the database engine tuning load the and select the database to and press this will give you a list of focus on changes to the dettaglioorarilinee and any other table that took up a large part of the execution plan with a scan strongly advise not implementing the recommended changes straight from this instead use these recommndations as a if none of the above give you the needed performance you could look into denormalizing the table dettaglioorarilinee so that each row has the data for the a and b this is probably not a good

 take a step back and look at this from a higher the advantages of any language feature lie in the ability to succinctly express the in a more natural way with respect to the problem mechanics of oop are easily implemented in plain c with structs and function you can even get a bit of oop feel doing it that oop idioms are not nearly as forthcoming in such an when actual language support for oop then the expressiveness of the paradigm comes and the way a language implements an idea has a very real impact on what is and for see differences in code using in in the end not about the components and underlying but rather how put together and used that make oo in what it	
 take a wild stab in the dark and say your worker threads are spending lots of time waiting on the condition to get good cpu performance in this kind of situation where your code is mostly cpu it is understood to use a task oriented style of where you treat the threads as a and you use a queue structure to feed work to they should spend a very small amount of time pulling work off the queue and most of their time doing the actual you have right now is a situation where they are probably doing work for a then notifying the main thread via the semaphore that they are the main thread will not release them until both threads have finished working on the frame they are currently you are using have you considered using it makes working with multithreaded code much and the api is actually kind of similar to but in a kind of

 talking about maintaining a sorted there is no advantage over some kind of just maybe it consumes less memory or is a simpler into a sorted list will involve a which means that each insert is therefore sorting n items becomes into a container such as a balanced is typically therefore the sort is which is of course for small lists it hardly makes any you might use an insert sort if you have to write it yourself without any the lists are small you care about	
 talking about some fairly advanced threading using the system control no way to prevent the message loop from completing any more than there is a method for interrupting another if this capability is very important to you could build all custom controls and within your painting code you could check a of a boolean value indicating whether or not painting should if i can take a stab in the going to guess that not actually explicitly doing any if this is the then the scenario that you describe ever actually as the process of refreshing the gui is going to complete before another one can begin this anonymous process describing that calls for another refresh or deems the current one because code on the same thread executes really no opportunity for an unrelated piece of code to cause an semantics of how and when repaints take place difference between and and their respective impacts on this for is a topic probably really not of interest to just know that if then to implement your own code whether or not the should continue this means custom controls logic in the paint then what can never this is

 tells an application to the other signals tell the application other things which are unrelated to shutdown but may sometimes have the same use if you want an application to shut tell it give it misleading so many seem to think more than one signal is necessary to convey that message is beyond if sigterm terminate it because the application has chosen to handle the which means it has a very good reason to not terminate got cleanup to if you allow it to finish no telling how it will behave the next time you start it or how much of its persistent data just more information on what the real meaning of the signals see and confuse with they are not the same only typical for authors of bad scripts to send and bad scripts are send if the application handles the it can take it a second to it can take a can take an depending on what the application has to get done before ready to any logic that an cleanup sequence has taken long enough and needs to be shortcut or sigkilled after x seconds is plain only reason why an application would a sigkill to is if something was so horribly wrong that something bugged out during its cleanup sequence or in which case you can open a terminal and sigkill it aside from which you really should never ever encounter unless the one developing the the only one other reason why sigkill something is because you want to prevent it from cleaning itself in which case you also want the sigterm first and after a timeout not because half the world uses sigkill after 5 seconds that not horribly

 template pattern is used when a particular operation has some invariant that can be defined in terms of other varying primitive the abstract class defines the invariant while the implementing classes defined the dependent in a the behavior implementations are independent each implementing class defines the behavior and there is no code shared between both are behavioral patterns as are consumed in much the same way by typically strategies have a single public method the whereas templates may define a set of public methods as well as a set of supporting private primitives that subclasses must two patterns could easily be used you might have a strategy pattern where several implementations belong to a family of strategies implemented using a template

 test collision detections between 2 oriented bounding use separating axis theorem in fact sat can be used for collision detection between any 2 convex this technique is not overly complex to understand and has a reasonable theorem can easily be extended to algorithm tries to determine is it is possible to fit a plane between two if such a plane then the object are and cannot determine if the objects are it is simply a matter of projecting the objects onto the of the and comparing the intervals and see if they there is obviously an infinite number of planes that can fit between two separated but it has been proved you only have to test a handful of can be shown that for the separation planes to be tested are the planes with normal equal to the axes of both so for 2 you only need to test 4 separation planes in out of the 4 once you found a separation plane that separates the then you know the box cannot and you return a no collision the 4 planes cannot separate the then the box must be and there you have a

 the answer is probably a combination of 1 and can take advantage of a lot of the tools and features that the framework provides for you by writing a or provider if the default options quite go as far as done just that on a number of client sites for example one of our clients has most of their users stored as commerce server and use the commerce server profile so we wrote a membership and profile provider to talk to those datastores a fairly simple people are probably going for 3 because of the need to authenticate over raw tcp this introduces a layer beyond that of the standard membership of what ms produce is or but there will always be edge cases where you want to do something quite that mean you end up rolling your i guess to have something beyond or that was simple for your average developer to they took the sensible option of just build this for the you take a look at the numerous ways you can authenticate against a wcf see what i mean these designed to handle different transport and are therefore much more the default roles and profile providers are fairly limited no so you need to check for each possible or explicitly assign each role to the all stored in one field as comma seperated values not easy to find all users got a value	
 the answer is thinking about the singleton pattern in php right now and have decided that although the singleton pattern can be coded in it is not really implemented since the instance is not shared across requests stored in the process memory which is the case for web server environments like java and ruby on you can serialize the singleton instance and store it in but not shared across i speculate that it would have to be stored in cache in order to fully implement the singleton pattern in but i done that so not

 the answer to your question depends on how your data member is distinguish two types of data members in a use the common term to refer to data are the logical state or of the attributes are rarely declared as have coined the protologism it denote members that are simply that are somewhat divorced from the state of the have no contextual relevance to the user of the exist in the class only to contribute to the efficient operation of the are usually declared in the class as mutable and are or example say your object is a linked you have a pointer to the first item in the would consider this pointer a contribute because does not represent the data in the if the list is sorted and is set to the new first item in the user of the list object could care less how the is only that the list data has modified or not and that the the list is sorted or not to the if you had a booean data member to quickly the list is in a sorted that too would be a it is the list structure itself which imbues the sorted variable member is used simply to efficiently remember the having to scan the another if you have a const method that searches the you know that typically the search will return recently previously searched for would keep a pointer in your class to such a item so your first check if the last found item matches the search key before entire list the method does indeed need to search the list and the pointer would be pointer i would consider to be a contribute because only there to help speed up the even though updates the pointer the method is because none of the data in the container are data members that are attributes are usually not declared data members that contribute to the functioning of an object will usually be

 the easiest solution is to only really working on one project at a if you work on multiple you could have another alias which changed the directories within those aliases use something game17 this is a useful thing to i decided to put together a series of scripts that can be all based aroung a configuration file that you place in your home along with aliases to source the file is of the lists all the relevant projects and sodoku in this and their directories may be different for each but have src and data in this first action is to initialize so the end of your and create the file sets up the four aliases to source the files which include usage list all directories in current list all show current set current project to show current and since they can get out of sync if you mix cd and set actual real directory to expected directory other get them back into set directory to actual script which just lists the allowed directories in the current project are broken into multiple lines for readability but they should all be on one directories grep sed sort sed shows all the possible projects grep sed sort sed the meaty sets shows the current grep if 0 echo project name export project is the same for directories within the grep if 0 echo directory name for project export cd sed head sed sed head sed project directory directory uses three environment variables which are reserved for its own and other than those and the files and there are no other resources the yet most adaptable solution i could come up best of

 the entity framework keeps data in do many then as with many collections there are probably internal as you add items to a the internal array doubles in if you have a collection like an arraylist containing 256 and add the 257th item to then what happens internally is a new block of memory is allocated for a 512 item they 256 item array is copied to the new 512 item and then the 256 item array is made available for garbage thus at the point of transition you will have 768 items allocated in memory just because you added the 257th i have run into headaches with this when using because you need almost 3 times as much contigous unfragmented memory than what you really this is the property you see on and it is almost always a power of it double in size as bet is there are internal arrays that double in size as needed to support your collections of in memory so objects of the same type would probably be held in an internal array of size if like similar techniques elsewhere in the then whenever the 262145th item was both an array of 262144 and 524288 existed in memory while the items were copied to the new a total of 786432 items in the old array would stick around until the garbage collector decided it needed might be some options in the entity framework regarding concurrency support that you could disable which might improve memory i am only speculating here but to support concurrency they store both the current version of the and original version for comparison to support would also look at filtering what data you are interacting try to find clever criteria to limit what is queried and loaded in for if you had an application that allowed a user to edit customer but only certain accounts were assigned to then use that as your filtering criteria so that you only load in memory those accounts that the user could potentially interact

 the getting of the controllers and actions seems to me to be the relatively trivial the hard part is being able to get all the possible parameter values that you might want to show in the urls of your if you have a url pattern like then not going to be able to determine through reflection what the meaning of or the possible the best you can do is determine the system occurred to me as i was looking at this is that a sitemap is really just another view of your so one random thought i had was that if you inherit from a base controller in your and you have a method on that base controller that has to be actionresult you could create a which calls each of the other controllers in the solution and asks them for their and then renders them all together in one final sort of a composite though not a concept been added to this framework

 the library is a shared object or then everything in the library is but at run the cost in extra memory is offset by sharing the library the code between all the processes in memory that use that this is a big win for something like less so for but you probably asking about shared libraries are a simply a collection of individual object each the result of a separate compilation and possibly not even written in the same source each object file has a number of exported and almost always a number of imported job is to create a finished executable that has no remaining undefined imported of if dynamic linking is but bear with to do it starts with the modules named explicitly on the link command line possibly implicitly in its and assumes that any module named explicitly must be part of the finished it then attempts to find definitions for all of the undefined the named object modules expect to get symbols from some library such as your you have a single module that calls the funtion which will result in the linker looking for module that exports say that the library named a probably offers and but you specify you implied that and do not call each which i will was built from and where each defines the corresponding single then the linker will include and ignore if included that defined both and then it will include in the satisfying the need for and including the unused function others have there are linkers that are capable of splitting individual functions out of and including only those that are actually in many that is a safe thing to but it is usually safest to assume that your linker does not do that unless you have specific else to be aware of is that most linkers make as few passes as they can through the files and libraries that are named on the command and build up their symbol table as they as a practical this means that it is good practice to always specify libraries after all of the object modules on the link command

 the main concern concurrent i will multiple instances of your app god other apps outside your be performing inserts you can probably manage the inserts through a synchronized module in your and avoid race conditions like joel change the i know you but the problem is as old as the and been solved well at the database if you want to fix it just going to have to loop check for over and over and over the fundamental problem is that you perform a transaction mean that in the sql but in the larger if you have support from the only further thought i have is that if you at least have control over who has access to the database only either written or approved by you could implement a mutex of where a is shared by all the apps and ownership of the mutex is required to do an that would be its own hairy ball of as have to figure out policy for dead where configuration and of course a client could do inserts without the talking stick and hose the whole

 the method syntax is like this for a couple of one of these is so that it is clear what the parameters you are specifying for if you are adding an object to an at a certain you would do it using the method is called and it is clear that an object is being inserted at a specified adding a string at index 5 of an called would be called as index also reduces ambiguity between the order of the method ensuring that you pass the object parameter the index this becomes more useful when using functions that take a large number of and reduces error in passing the the method naming convention is such because support if you want to write a method that does the same but takes different this can be for the this has several object creation a language such as you would simply overload the number method to allow different data types to be passed as the in this syntax allows several different variants of the same function to be by changing the name of the method for each variant of the

 the server waits for the email to be sent before giving the user any were there problems connecting to the mailserver server down the user request would timeout too and he be told anything about the status of his so i believe you should really do this you should check whether doing that is even allowed by if not the you may check if allowed if you purchase one of their surely a limit to the number of outgoing emails you may send within a given timeframe so if expecting your online store to be you may hit that limit and bump into some nasty if not the you should check whether your host offers email servers plans include them for as then using your isp would be the most obvious

 the short design patterns will often increase the complexity of the they add extra abstractions in places they might not be strictly in the long term they reduce complexity because future enhancements and changes fit into the patterns in a simple without the these changes would be much more intrusive and complexity would likely be much for example a decorator the first time you use it will add complexity because now you have to define an interface for the object and create another class to add the this could likely be done with a simple property and be done when you get to 5 or 20 the complexity with a decorator is much less than with	
 the shortest way i can think not but will work under	
 the simplest answer is what you are looking simply by getting a write lock replicated and making a transactional function that gets the current value of the increments it and saves it back to the certainly you will get increased overhead as the system but i would recommend writing a server that does this for you and run that on a subset of the so the lock contention is not directly linked with the cluster

 the solution looking foos bars for x in recommend using a list comprehension for x in over using map as it avoids the overhead of a function call on every iteration can be very if just going to use it in a for get better speeds by using a generator y for x in for z in print difference is that the generator comprehension is in response to this course you that you copy all entries are the same bars so if you modify any one of them original you modify all of suppose this is a valid there are two solutions to this that i can think the most efficient is probably something like for x in tuples are this will prevent bars from being modified through the results of this list comprehension generator comprehension if you go that if you really need to modify each and every one of the you can do copy import for x in this can be a bit expensive both in terms of memory usage and in so recommend against it unless you really need to add to each one of

 then have no reseatable type which can not be you included 3 types of which would just complicate the language for very little gain then why not add the 4th type reference which can be better question may why would you want references to be if they that would make them less useful in a lot of it would make it harder for the compiler to do alias seems that the main reason references in java or are reseatable is because they do the work of they point to they are not aliases for an should the effect of the following i j with it is j is an alias for and i ends up with the value references had been then the third line would bind the reference j to a different it would no longer alias but instead the integer literal 43 of or perhaps a simpler at least syntactically i k j reseatable j would point to k after evaluating this j still points to and i is assigned the value references reseatable changes the semantics of the the reference can no longer be an alias for another instead it becomes a separate type of with its own assignment and then one of the most common usages of references would be and nothing would be gained in the newly gained functionality for references already existed in the form of so now have two ways to do the same and no way to do what references in the current language

 there absolutely are situations where it is better to not catch an an exception can sometimes tell you that your program is in an unknown there are a number of exceptions where this is pretty much intrinsically true given the exception a essentially tells you is a and by catching such an you may hide the which sounds good in the short but in the long term be happier to fix the product may not but it certainly have the expected this is also true for exception types we invent for the fact that exception a has been thrown should be and yet it has so a something very important happens when you catch an the blocks for the whole call stack inside the try block anything it will be what do those finally blocks and if the program is in an unknown i really do mean they could erase valuable customer data from the they could throw more they could corrupt data in making the bug impossible to when an exception indicates an unknown you want to run any more so whatever you catch the let it fly and your program will terminate and windows error reporting will be able to capture the state of the program as it was when the problem was originally if you catch the you will cause more code to which will screw up the state of the program should you throw an exception knowing it be i think that question misunderstands the nature of reusable the whole idea of a method is that it has a that it it accepts certain parameters and returns a certain plus also it throws certain exceptions under certain the contract up to the caller what they do with for some exception a might indicate a recoverable for other it might indicate a and from what i said it should be clear that if an exception indicates a must not be if wondering what this means for the enterprise exception handling pretty they tell you to and then decide whether to rethrow based on your too late the blocks have already executed by that do

 there any real issue such as performance when the hibernate object model and the database physical model no longer any should they be keep in current system was original designed for a low number of users so not much effort was done to keep the physical and objects in the developers went about their task and the architects did not now that we are in the process of the legacy system into the new a concern has been raised in that the legacy system handles a lot of user volume and might bring the new system to its comments below the concern was about relationships in the data layer vs the object if there is no dependencies between the then there is no performance hits if these relationships do not is that concern from my view is that the development team spends a lot of time the hibernate but nothing at the database layer to improve the performance of the i would have assumed that they would tune at both these issue be from just a poor initial design of the database to begin with and trying to up the difference by the use of am new to this project so playing object vs database physical

 these data classes set one level above the primitives constraining data to make it they sit just above the and which is where talking about refactoring the validation code into a separate problem with refactoring the validation is that the regex necessary for validation exists only in the subclasses of since each subclass has a different this means that the validation data is only available to the not any of if i factor out the validation callers would need access to the class internal static readonly regex regex public string value regex enforced by so no values public password original original public static explicit operator string value new value when reading a value from the database or reading user the password constructor forwards the to the base class to handle the another trick is that it trims the end characters in case the database type is char rather than so i have to remember to do here is what the main constructor for regexconstrainedstring looks string regex if if throw new meet minimum length of if if throw new exceeds maximum length of if throw new value specified must match callers would need access to the i think my best bet is to implement a method in the which forwards the data to the method in the base in other i would add this line to the password static bool string value like this because replicating the subclasses constructor having to remember to trim the string again and pass the same lengths when this requirement would be forced upon all subclasses of and not something i want to these data classes like password is so because regexconstrainedstring handles most of the implementing there are other complications with factoring out the the validation involves running and storing a regex match in the since some data types may have properties that report on specific elements of the for my sessionid class contains properties like which return a matched group from the match stored in the data class the bottom line is that this static method is an entirely different since essentially incompatible with the constructor the constructor cannot use so i would end up replicating code once could factor out the validation code by replicating it and tweaking it for a static context and imposing requirements on or i could keep things much simpler and just perform the object the relative extra memory allocated would be as only a string and match reference is stored in the everything such as the match and the string itself would still be generated by the validation so no way around i could worry about the performance all but my experience has been that is more because correctness often leads to numerous other for i ever have to worry about improperly formatted or sized data flowing through my because only meaningful data types are which forces validation to the into the application from other be it database or of my validation code was removed as a and i find myself only checking for nulls having reached this i now understand why including nulls was billion dollar seems to be the only thing i have to check for even though they are essentially in my complex objects having these data types as fields cannot be constructed with but i have to enforce that in the property which is because they otherwise would never need validation only code that runs in response to changes in simulated the clr function calls both and found that when all data is the performance difference is only fractions of a millisecond per thousand which is when roughly half the passwords are throwing exceptions in the three orders of magnitude which equates to about 1 extra sec per 1000 the magnitudes of difference will of course multiple as multiple clr calls are made for multiple columns in the but a factor of 3 to 5 for my is an extra 3 5 second per 1000 updates acceptable to as a trade off for keeping my code very simple and that depends on the update if my application were getting 1000 updates per a 3 5 second delay would be on the other i was getting 1000 updates a minute or an it may be perfectly in my i can tell you now that quite so i think just go with the instantiation and allow the errors of in this test i handled the errors in the clr instead of letting sql server handle marshalling the error info to sql and then possibly back to the could definitely slow things down much i guess i will have to fully implement this to get a real but from this preliminary pretty sure what the results will

 thing i would suggest is rolling your own method of signing the xml i was originally using the signedxml class for but then realized that it was incredibly easy for anyone to deduce what i was doing just by looking at the xml file itself the algorithms and such are i combined each piece of data license and version in my hashed and signed the rather than the entire xml then i obfuscated it a bit more and added the data as a single element in the by looking at impossible to see any kind of indicator as to what algorithms or processes i of anyone could easily open my assembly in reflector and see how being since a copy of each license is kept on if i suspect that a customer has changed the license to give them more i can verify their copy with mine and deny them any further support take legal

 thing you could do if you have the disk space is create a second table with the correct clustered index copy the rows over over to the new table over several days via an incremental once all the rows are there execute on both tables would require just a few minutes of if your apps were referencing a view instead of the physical table you could have this done with zero downtime to your i hope this also have to deal with the update to the you need to have a or last updated field available on the source table so that you can sync the updates once you have all the rows copied

 thing you may try is having your installer call and then respond with in in your activex this might get you though i wonder if ie may still try calling back into your unloaded simple enough to could also just write a stub dll that implements all the interfaces you have that touch ie and then just thunks through to your dll that actually implements the then you could have your installer broadcast a message that says the real then you broadcast another message when your done and it loads the new while the update is ocurring your stub draws a wait while i	
 thing you must consider is wait time on the other end of the having multiple threads will allow you to be waiting for a response on one while preparing the next transaction on the at least how i understand so i think a few threads will turn out better than the other hand you must consider the overhead involved with dealing on multiple the details of the application are important part of the consideration

 think a simple for instance on the platform implements connection pooling by so it will automatically adjust a of connections and them so not constantly creating and destroying expensive say you were writing a data collection application that monitored 200 separate input every time one of those inputs you fire off a thread that records the event to the i would say that could be a bad design if a chance that even a fraction of those could fire off at the same suddenly having 20 or 40 active database connections is it might be better to queue the and as long as there are updates left in the a singleton connection picks them off the queue and executes them on the more efficient because you only have to negotiate the connection and authentication once no activity for a while you could choose to close down the this kind of behavior would be hard to implement without a central resource manager like a

 think adobe tries to access the cross domain file on port 843 and if it cannot the file on that port it tries the port that trying to connect to 80 if not sure but you might want to check to make sure that your server allows access to the worth mentioning is that you should allow full access to the directory where your local swf application do this with the adobe settings a side i think the settings manager is one of the worst ui atrocoties in the flash eco just the fact that they need to clarify in a text underneith the manager that it is infact not a screenshot really takes the	
 think all putting it before or after matter except against a very specific threat fact that there is supposed to defeat rainbow threat model i alluded to would be the scenario where the adversary have rainbow tables of common salts to the the guessing they either have it appended or prepended but not and a poor be better to assume that they have the capacity to store these rainbow but tables with strange salts interspersed in the middle of the in narrow i would conjecture that interspersed would be i pick a different salt per a long and include odd characters in it like symbols and ascii

 think confusing your operator precedence and of you want to say in c the has a higher so your expression as it is and or my speed is lower than you have an extra pair of which suggests that you intended to prioritize things mention that code that has a bunch of similar looking if statements is fairly poorly a better way to implement it would be either with tables or data structures to represent the or at least a better that posted the it really looks like working too hard on of if or switch based on year should only be about 4 for each call a separate function to do the that will already be return return know but there should be some sort of switch you can manage each year your conditions are in an ascending order of you could do something return return return return is still far from but it will already be a lot cleaner and looking at your it looks like you even need that many you are paying 50 why not just calculate the diff and then just return the result of the know just guessing at the

 think find yourself backed into an uncomfortable corner if you try to use any metric to definitively predict or control the outcome of your your project will ask the questions the best you can do is a that is based on your current knowledge of the project at this point in time and this just comes from experience and literally the your estimates will likely be off by several orders of they only become more accurate as your team understands the problem domain and they estimate no more than weeks barry boehm steve illustrated this effect with the of further you are from implementation of a system or feature the greater the innacuracy of your estimates as you get and understand the problem domain estimates begin to take on greater accuracy this is in software projects where there is a lot of or almost every we want to leave concrete estimation until the last responsible moment no more than weeks can also expect one thing with absolute specifications will change over how you plan to adapt and manage that change will measure your the best judgement that can be made to scope your work would be to assemble the team who will work on the project and the to collaboratively work out the big brush strokes the major features of the write these as user stories that the team estimates using relative weight points mike book on agile estimating and and devise a release plan that will give the customer a forecast on what to expect they can then decide if the investment will generate the return they are looking assuming that be releasing so that your customer is always in possession of some functional increment of the final product vital for their continued valuation of the r

 think of it this way the username is the way of figuring out which account a user is trying to login the password is the way of figuring out whether the user is actually allowed to login as that in this means going to look up a row in your accounts table using the username as an by encrypting the simply making it harder to find the right if using the same encryption scheme to encrypt the username and they are pretty much equally secure if you can break you can break the encrypting both makes it harder to lookup the but add any additional in your question you talk about decrypting your password you probably want to make this impossible most people encrypt their passwords using a hash function of some sort and sha256 are along with a the part simply means that once you run something through the you use what you get out to get what you started if you start with the same always get the same the salt is a secret that only your application knows of like an encryption which is added to whatever you are before it is run through the this makes it impossible to do things like match two encrypted passwords from two different sites using different

 think that i can explain this there is a better explanation somewhere in one of either or but i feel like i believe what you are seeing is a consequence of how virtual functions are implemented and the pay for it until you use nature of there are no virtual methods in then a pointer to the object points to the as soon as a virtual method is the compiler inserts a virtual lookup table and the pointer points to this probably missing something my brain working since i could not get this to occur until i inserted a data member in the base if the base class has a data member and the first child class has a then the offsets differ by the size of the vtable on my an example that shows this t this a char void a virtual void virtual void b virtual void a b c return this on my machine prints the this this this this this this this interesting thing is that both and exhibit the address change as between calling methods on and or the difference is that contains a virtual this allows the compiler to insert the additional table necessary to implement function the other interesting thing that this program shows is that and is different in when it is called you can also see a size increase using as soon as the virtual table is your as soon as you made the vtable is inserted and it actually pays attention to real type of the object as well as inserting the bookkeeping structures this causes the offset to the base of the object to i really wish that i could find the reference that describes a mythical memory layout and why the address of an object is dependent on the type that it is being interpreted as when inheritance is mixed into the you have heard this classes always have virtual this will help eliminate little surprises like

 think that the most important letter in mvc is v for working with ajax with and js is part of presentation layer so by theory it is place for view is responsible for what you send to end and mvc patter is there not only to separate view and controller but to enable us multiple views for the same data model it is best to encapsulate code in a class and use that same controller code to render different in first case that could be drawing of a static but in other scenario it is view specially designed for ajax calls and data may be in json or other standard format it as long as you respect responsibilities that every layer

 think the answer to this will depend on what you want to do in the event a symbol does come in at exactly the same could create a unique index on the symbol and the datetime column but this would cause a unique key violation for one of the two if designing for this could be an expensive option is to have a timestamp which would insure that even if you do happen to get two identical symbols at the exact same your insert will not real question is what do you want to do with that second identical can you afford the expense of checking to see if an identical symbol and datetime already exists in the table before you write to so you could then log and discard the

 think the best solution here is to break up the address class into two address information person information it would be fairly simple in the person class to compare the core address information without creating a this does create a bit of coupling in your code because person will now have a bit of inner knowledge about how occupiedaddress but these classes already have tight coupling so really made the problem no ideal solution would be to completely decouple these

 think the check makes sense when you want to be sure the file was there in the first as you said settings there is a file i will try and merge the existing settings instead of blowing them cases would be when a user tells me to do something with a yes i know the openfiledialog will check if a file exists this is i vaguely remeber back in vb6 this was not the so verifying the file existed that they just told me to use was rather not program by miss the you might try and access the an exception is thrown and then when you go to create the the file was already placed which now causes your exception handling code to go on the so i guess we could then have an exception handler in our exception handler to catch that the file changed yet rather try and prevent not use them to control another time to check for attributes such as size is when your waiting for a file operation to yes you never know for sure but with a good algorithim and depending on the system writting the file you might be able to handle a good deal of cases a system running for five years which watched for small files coming over and it uses a the same api as the file system and then starts polling waiting for the file to stop before raising an event that the file is ready to be

 think the premature optimization quote is used by too many to avoid thinking about the hard stuff concerning how well the application will i guarantee the users want you to think about how to design it so it will run as fast as is not to say you should be timing but the design phase is the easiest place to optimize and not cost lots of time are often several ways to do you should pick in the design phase the one which is most likely to perform the best it turns out to be one of the times when it the then optimize this should trump the need to have easy to read you considering performance in the design you going to have a well designed that mean it should be the only concern in a database rate it as 3rd in right after data integrity and but trying to fix a system where poorly performing techniques were used throughout because the developers thought they were easier to understand is a being a user of such a system where you have to wait for minutes everytime you want to move from one screen to another is a nightmare reallly should spend all day everyday for at least a using their for everyone who is stuck with the badly designed it costs less to design properly than to fix later and considering performance is critical to designing work somewhere where the orginal developers drank the koolaid about premature optimization and did everything the way they thought was simplest which in almost every case was the wrong choice from a performance now we are at 10 times the size we were three years ago and every screen on every website takes 30 seconds or so to load worse times and we are losing customers because of but changing it will be too hard because at the base they designed the database without considering how it would perform and redesigning a database with many many gigabytes of data into a new structure is way too time consuming and if it had been designed to perform from the start it would be both easier to maintain and faster for the we talking about the need to performance tune the top 10 slowest queries we are talking about the fact that the overall structure requires a drastic change that would affect virtually every query against the to perform do micro optimization until you nmeed but please do the macro consider if is this the best way before you commit to the write cursors to hit tables with millions of records when a statement will try to have as few tables as possible becasue that seems to be a more elegant solution when the tables are storing disparate items as and causing every single query to hit the same table and causing every delete to check all sorts of foreign key tables that will not ever have a record for that type of entity takes minutes to delete one record from the main table in our a real joy when something goes wrong in an import data from a client and we have to delete let me tell

 think you are looking directly at module when you jit it show up under your dll it shows up in memory the runtime the module pages you are looking at are mostly metadata and which is why they are still an i wrote a small program that generates 30k static methods and calls on my the jit version of this program has mb of private comitted while the ngen version has within your module ngen does help with memory when the runtime is able to load an ngen it have to read the metadata of your module in order to jit the the jit version of my test application is using of working the ngen version is using 32 should also help your startup impact to warm startup time can be but the impact to cold startup time reading all those pages off the can be

 think you are on the right i usually do in a situation like this is design a simple language that captures my needs and write a ll1 parser for the language has to have syntax in i can either quote or just wrap it in brackets that i can and just pass it through to the output can either have it generate a parse tree and generate say 3 different kinds of code from or i can just have it generate code on the either using a mode variable with 3 or just simultaneously write code to 3 different output more than one way to do if you are afraid of writing parsers some programmers there is lots of help elsewhere on	
 think you can define it in your application connection i googled for access and record a that might see the accepted answer for real details on how access and jet get	
 think you can easily do giving the sax parser a resource to read and then closing it and the sax parser still expects to read from it hence throwing an document you want to do this i think your sax parser that implemented should silently swallow events once decided to ignore further your implementations of should perform a check to see whether still interested in these events before way the sax parser can run cleanly to the end of the document without you processing any more why not record the fact that closed the input and then when you get an document see if it in fact and only log an error if it really was	
 think you can get a packaged solution to do exactly what you but you can use two different approach to solve the diffstat on the two then use a small shell script to extract the filenames that have more of difference and then use a full diff on those and your is quite good and flexible for but i doubt that you can teach him to do the you can see a recursive difference between two directories and you can teach him to ignore lines with

 think you generate members except by declaring them bite the bullet and declare a constructor for i think static reflection is a the only thing static is the lookup of the member you want to reference a good thing as far as it but not very	
 think you have a good this will eventually move most of the code into taking advantage of the better the vb6 code comprise com mentioned that the code be stopped for a complete but you have to one by you can replace each piece of vb6 functionality with the equivalent this would allow you to make one change at a time with automated tests to prove you broken	
 think you have a problem in you want a pointer it should be	
 think you have it all well modularized code is as flexible as it look at the tons of libs available for the libs that are used a lot a cleanly they solve one problem and they solve it gives the developer using those the to decide what he needs and pick the libs necessary to do the single lib is in the sense that you can use it in many different big blob of mud sorry if statements not at it is hard wired to all the stuff it you want to use it in a different do that without changing the you are really seeing considering the implementation and architecture of code as flexible in the sense of can change it at no matter if he knows anything about results in ugly which soon is so rigid and that you only can throw it a and it even go down the because it is so

 think your best bet would be to check the context where you see the swf embedded within web pages so if that page has 100 occurences of the word then it might be a as an detect an ad it might be trickier but i think that checking the domainname where the swf is hosted might do the also html tags around the swf will be of great	
 think your conditional is looking for or i think you need to move a outside the grouping if you want to look for or

 thinking that maybe being added twice and only removed would that is is there any way i can see the handlers in the do not think that is if you do not know the number of times the event handler was taking them off is not a straight forward i presume you can use reflection to achieve would instead recommend you study the code and understand and you have multiple event so that you can manually remove them if need might want to note suggested by that onrowleave is a method of the datagridview and is not an this method is not exposed to the user but instead is responsible for raising the rowleave event which the user can i am not quite sure why you use the term	
 thinking through data access for an coming from a company that uses a lot of windows applications with client data sets there is a natural dendancy towards a dataset approach for dealing with more keen on a business object approach and i like the idea of caching a dataset in the session then applying an anyone have any experience help to pass on about the pros and cons of both dataset vs business objects	
 this a covariance a static versus dynamic dispatch static dispatch means an overloaded method call is bound to the appropriate type at compile time based on the type of the passed base derived base void base a new prints derived b new prints dispatched based on declared base c new prints void void dispatch means the function is bound at runtime based on the actual type of the object stored in the public virtual void derived public override void void base a new prints derived b new prints dynamically dispatched based type of object stored in base c new prints void void last print shows the difference between the like most oop only supports dynamic dispatch for the implicit parameter to as in other words methods are dynamically but methods are typical solution to fake multiple dispatch in single dispatch languages is by using the which would work for you	
 this a definitive or textbook and i might be serialization needs to be seperated out into binary others or an xml derivitave binary serialization is mostly a to but it allows the object to be serialized and restored in their current xml serialization typically only serialized the public of an unless overriden by adding a custom iserializable the case of xml serialization i believe uses reflection to determine which fields and properties get converted to their equivalent adding an attribute will implement a default behavior which can be adjusted by applying other attributes at the field level as metadata reflection depends stores all the object members as well as their attributes and which allows the serializer to determine how it should build the

 this code there is a lot wrong with elementtype is an enum in the not an so this has to be a custom annotation it uses a common class name for an creating it uses a long instead of an or at least a declared constant to define a type which is most likely not to be understood as a and it declares a class name in all lower

 this instead the are usually considered to be valid so if your application specifically needs ok to filter in a loop using

 this is a bit hard to answer without knowing how detailed guidance you but an makes such applications quite since both and threading are readily my solution would probably involve a global stack containing new and a farm of a constant number of threads that pop urls from the store the urls as a custom so that i could keep track of the think your main issue here will be with sites that or follow the http noticed many times in similiar applications that sometimes these time out and eventually they end up blocking all the unfortunately i have any good solutions few useful classes as a starting	
 this is a fixed list it seems it or else you store it as an i use main reason to use over is for ease of use with querying actually go with a variant of store the value as an integer and map to an enum on data also create a table representing the enum with the value as the pk and the name as another that way and efficient to use with your but also easy to get the logical value with querying and other uses that use your data access

 this is my first question on so hopefully this something been beaten to death and i been able to find developing an application that is going to be distributed we have gotten the rights to distribute sql server 2008 express edition with our but exactly how to do this is a little more right now using a standard visual studio setup and i was obviously hoping for something very like a configurable merge but obviously no such thing exists or i be posting here road i had started going down was to include the exe with our then use a custom install action to extract it and pass command line arguments to the sql installer to create our named where the problem comes is i can run the script from windows and it installs sql server just as it but i run the sql installer from my custom action because saying that there is already another installation in this other installation of my and it going to end until sql server so essentially at a deadlock until sql finally gives up and errors i want is a named instance of sql server for my application that is installed with it and gets uninstalled with writing my own installer is not an option because of and my coworker says installshield is not an option because of complexity never used so take his word for does anyone have any a named instance of sql server 2008 express with my

 this is not a conflict on the theoretical level but a conflict on an implementation problem is not having domain models as versus more complex object map where order has orderitems and some calculatetotal the specific problem is for that order needs to grab the latest wholesale prices of the orderitem from some web service in china so you have some spring service running that allows calls to this pricequery service in order has calculatetotal which iterates over every gets the latest and adds it to the how would you ensure that every order has a reference to this pricequery how would you restore it upon loading from and fresh this is my exact easy way would be to pass a reference to the calculatetotal but what if your object uses this service internally throughout its what if used in 10 it gets messy to pass references around every way would be to move calculatetotal out of the order and into the but that breaks oo design and we move towards the old way of domain objects require references to many but these objects get persisted or so any references they hold to outside components beans in this are transient and get wiped they need to be when the object is or loaded from the but this is extremely ugly and i see an elegant way to do a while now practiced loose coupling and di with the help of helped me a lot in keeping things manageable and a while i read design and some martin as a been trying to convert my domain models from simple dtos simple representations of a table just data no into a more rich domain my domain grows and takes on new my domain objects are starting to require some of the beans that i have in my spring this has quickly become a nightmare and one of the most difficult parts of converting to a rich domain there are points where i am manually injecting a reference to the application context into my object is loaded from repository or other responsible entity since the component references are transient and obviously get object is created from factory since a newly created object lacks the component object is in a quartz job or some other place since the transient component references get ugly because passing the object an application context reference and expecting it to pull out by name references to the components it this direct ugly code because in all of those mentioned places i need logic for injecting an error prone because i have to remember to inject in all those places for all those which is harder than it has got to be a better way and hoping you can shed some light on can i resolve the conflict between loose injection and a rich domain

 this is really misstated or just not getting application requests the web page and gets it and has to ascertain if it is another or this is to say that part of the web request to return the true or false at the beginning which is where my first confusion why you doing a similar comparison on the false cases and seeing if there are sufficient similarities to create 3 buckets of results for some random page page is more similar to true and thus is viewed as page is more similar to false and thus is viewed as page more similar to either and thus the result is something like a null or exception situation as it possible to discern which result makes of where that 3rd case could the page contains an integer and if positive the result is true and if negative the result is what if the result is does 0 count as positive since it is equal to its absolute value or does it count as a negative for some am i way off in what you are trying to do

 this originally started as a question about 404 but now a question why the patch that i applied would make a do you get a cached action to return a 404 on all requests that raise an not just the first if you start an empty rails add a product model and setup your setup your cache backend in rake then start in production and hit the site for a productcontroller def render first time the page is it returns the 404 page as every subsequent hit to that url returns a blank page with 200 how do you get it to return 404 every are the curl followed by the curl 404 not 20 apr 2009 curl 200 20 apr 2009 second response is clearly is a copy of the log for the 2 at find product with at chain halted as chain halted as in 12ms 200 ok if you pull the cached action out of the it has some sort of empty garbage in am i doing wrong confirmed that rails and exhibit this but the older versions store an empty response into the cache and they indeed throw a 404 for the subsequent having trouble testing against edge because loading it causes the following error when starting the uninitialized constant tested against the current head of the and it too exhibits this attempted to track down when the change occurred in the rails codebase to determine if it was it seems that seemingly innocuous is where the bug are the details of the where 404 denotes the desired 200 being 375e8976e3 b1c989f28d beca1f2e15 f1fff0a48 f1e20ce9a7 a5004573d8 2e1132fad8 200 the difference seems to start at this c69d8c043f d961592886 276ec16007 0efec6452 13c6c3cfc5 fb2325e35 3cb89257b4 is a patch that reverses the which when applied to tag fixes the am not smart enough to fathom why this seemingly small change would actually make a someone smarter than me could shed some light on the module actioncontroller do include include include include include patch seems to also fix the related showcased where the in xyms 404 not found did not show up in the above patch broke other things in so i delved in and generated a fix for the issue that cause collateral the patch and any subsequent updates will be at rails is the difference between include and include

 this question is certainly going to open up to some interesting in reply i quote the oft used small companies this might just be simply a matter of being the developers are also likely to be the most technically so it makes sense for them to adminster their own a fan of the which can be used when necessary noticed this approach was very similar in principal to uac later you are developing desktop software not a bad idea for developers to work within the confines that their end will experience limited or restricted if you build the software under limited a good chance that hit the same problems your target users would face given the same set of said if you have a good testing lab a decent qa team this might be a moot point especially if you have a half decent alm finally i develop without mainly because i trust myself and my in a team put it to a in larger organizations you might not have this the enterprise admins often have the final say

 this varies by and my example is overly it basically comes down to heap managers having linked lists that could be and you can use the linked list pointers to overwrite random parts of the i have a naive heap implementation whose control blocks are like int actual heap buffer follows this the heap gets this control block goes back into a list of freed by modifying the if i overrun a heap i can overwrite the pointers in the next control block with data i suppose i override these links to point to a pointer to code just in the buffer i and to the return address of the function on the when the heap manager tries to link the block back into a freed it will actually overwrite the return address on the stack with a pointer to code i article has a nice overview on heap overflow article describes some of the hardening that went into heap manager to prevent this sort of on possibility to run code from yes many platforms now make heap memory by default which raises the barrier to getting arbitrary code to you can still do a to style attack overwrite the return address to a known function which will be

 thought i could work this one out myself but i seem to be moving forward at the need to create a huffman tree of codes from the information provided by the dht huffman header in a jpg the dht header defines the huffman table in this a series of 16 each byte defines how many symbols have a huffman code of n amount of bits where n is the position of the byte in the that make any for example the raw data in hex 01 05 01 01 01 means of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 16 of 00 01 05 01 01 01 01 after the list of 16 bytes come the actual symbols for 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a combining the two parts we see that their 00 codes with 1 01 codes with 2 so take the first symbol from the 05 codes with 3 so take the next 5 symbols from the 01 02 03 04 and so finally we have to work out the actual huffman codes from the information if a mathematical you may have spotted already that these codes can be worked out by simply incrementing a binary number with the appropriate number of bits for every new code at a certain bit when the bit length simply increment the binary number and then double it and carry it becomes obvious to everyone else when drawn out a number of these binary trees by so this is the code i used to work out the huffman codes and store them in an i read the data at and put it in an int binarycode count stringbuffer codestring new array with code for contains the number of codes that have a certain number of for the binary number into a 0s until the code string is the right the created huffman code in an count binarycode binarycode i have generated the huffman codes and stored them in i can just add the symbols that they refer to in order as they come along in this may not be terribly elegant but it seems to work at least and creates the correct if anyone is still following you deserve a now the problem is like to store this information in a binary tree so that i can efficiently decode the jpg image data later rather than searching through arrays unfortunately i figure out a nice clean and efficient way to do this directly from the information provided in the jpg headers as only way i can think of is by working out the huffman codes as above then implementing some method that creates nodes as needed and saves the symbols in the appropriate using the codes as an address of however this seems such a round about way that is also duplicating the information i sure there must be a much better and simpler so if anyone understood my be very grateful for some i realise this is a very specific but if nothing else the info above might prove helpful to i am still very new at this so excuse my easy to understand code is especially to create huffman tree from ffc4 header in jpeg

 time taken to do a square root is much greater than the time taken to do an if you have been taught to avoid conditionals because they are then you have been they are a good deal slower than trivial operations like adding or subtracting integers or bit shifting which is why unrolling loops can be of benefit only if you are doing such trivial but in the grand scheme of things conditionals are good and not bad and to do something as complicated as call a function or calculate a square root to avoid a conditional statement is instead of x why not do 0 maybe the compiler will optimize them the but the second one simpler

 traditionally serial numbers are serial so the first example off the production line has sn 0001 then the next one is 0002 and the next one is i think that most people can work out that think actually asking about product which use a similar mechanism to public key message signing the product key is the encrypted the program has a public key which allows it to verify that the key is but only the software vendor has the secret key to the product the wikipedia article on has the general the only proviso is that for a key to be entered by the user it has to be quite a bit shorter than a pgp you are restricted to a very short serial then unlikely to be big enough to store the result of a typical signing in which case quite common to just use some variant of checksum on that has the disadvantage of being easy to reverse engineer security is because the algorithm is rather than due to any cryptographic each product would have its own and they usually get cracked quite you have 5 blocks of 5 you have which is bigger than so could use one of the standard digital signature algorithms which generates a 128 then convert that value to base

 tried compiling anything from source but bet that it just compiles all to one directory then i run it from that traditional apps and libraries based on the model also spew themselves over so trick is you can change the usually by passing it to the app will plonk itself into and so prefix defaults to which is left as a place for to install any programs you want all users to have access but which are not part of the all your local programs into is reasonable where there are only a few of but starts to get unmanageable when there are or some of them start dropping insane amounts of mysql and apache both dump a horrible mess of little tools into this case you can make a single prefix for each such as this allows you to deal with the application as a single so you can get rid of it by deleting but not a standalone unit you can rename or because the linker likes to know full can as an unprivileged drop into a prefix in your home directory such as you can then add to your path environment variable to be able to run it just by typing its if you are building a library other applications are going to have to link things are more complicated as you will have to tell them where to find it so they can get the and files they packages are compiled into the prefix contains all the commands provided by all the programs on the contains all the and so each folder containing a thousand programs mixed together in a confusing with these directories at your managing this maze is what package managers as are a hard and sometimes the package manager gets confused and screws up leaving you in dependency analogue to dll course this is all absolutely but you criticise it because the unix and if you like it you should go back to you there are some efforts to improve the unix packaging such as and but still pretty much fringe activities at the most distros think that their package manager is the only tool ever and imagine that you might want to install something that come from their

 tried it roughly about halfway through the project i realized that my models were hopelessly out of date from my code and were so complex that keeping them up to date was prohibitive and slowing me problem is that software is full of edge models are great at capturing the larger picture but once you start to actually code the implementation you keep finding all those edge cases and before too long you notice that the model is far too granular and you have to make a choice between maintaining the model or getting some code maybe the boilerplate generation is a benefit for starting up but after that the benefits quickly vanish and i found that i got a drastic drop in the models eventually disappeared from that

 try to force a corporate environment style agile programming workflow onto your but i do think that some level of agile methodology could be i actually think that some of your would be mitigated somewhat by some of the agile but would require some level of commitment from every one on the example the daily meetings have to be a large thing especially in a student project say making it smaller is having a trac site recommend over sharepoint if using svn with a single place a wiki to just track the standup info in one sentence can still be without taking more than minutes per day somebody misses a day or two here and not a big but if the team agrees to doing it can actually help the procrastination issue people to just say did doing has a benefit it keeps people at least thinking about your which tends to reduce the amount of as well as having people work in different locations but still stay in is also easy enough for to and can help keep the mechanical and electrical teams working and everybody moving being make sure to keep it short and sweet try to keep the burden to a but i still think value in some of the agile programming even in a student

 type inference used by thus i presume other is very precise the compiler will only allow the statement if the type is clear and the outcome is not really a loss in precision it is merely that saving the developer from stating the type more than reducing duplication in the it is important to realize that the result is strongly the compiler at exactly what type the variable there is like a variant if you type x it simply figures out that x is an int because you put an int on the thus saving you some typing and only reason future maintenance programmers might not understand it is if they simply understand the language feature of type inference in the first but i think it is more sound to expect and require that maintenance programmers know the language than it is to avoid good language features out of fear that future programmers know guess if in a situation where you that future programmers are junior and not very knowledgeable about the then maybe you would avoid some but that makes me wonder if you should consider some other or even a like access which is a hybrid of and something that a can do some things

 typical purpose for this style is in use for object pperson pperson new the second more traditional style one might forget if the first value passed to the constructor was the age or the this may also lead to multiple constructors based on the validity of some the first style one might forget to set some of the object properties and and may lead bugs where objects are not class property is added at a later point but not all the construction locations got updated to call the required code evolves i really like the fact that i can use the compiler to help me find all the places where an object is created when changing the signature of a so for that reason i prefer using regular constructors over this pattern might work well in applications that maintain their datamodel over time according to rules similar to those used in many database can add a to a that is null by upgrading existing data requires just a new null column in the that is not changes should still work the same with this null field

 unless performance is an issue it sounds like this is most likely the sort of job that will run occasionally and maybe even scheduled outside work i would loop over the existing cpu is invariably cheaper than time and maintenance considerations should override efficiency unless there is an impact on the business by not doing either way you should document why you have adopted whichever approach you choose in the if you already have a documentation regime i would suggest setting up a simple documentation table within the database with sp name and descriptive because of the nature of stored defined functions keeping overview control over what functionality has been implemented where can be tricky unless some strategy is adopted and seen far too many databases where there is a mass of stored and no simple method of groking what functionality has been implemented version control and full documentation is to be applauded if your group supports but if that available then documenting the database inside itself is and a quick

 used pointing to shared code in practice for a few years we have had some interesting problems with it that you should probably consider before using it here is the structure that we directories in both and in a project contain external definitions that pull in the common svn pget on lib1 lib2 problem that run into is multifaceted but related to tagging and branching our source as the projects change throughout the externals definition that i showed above has a few pretty severe problems if you want to have reproducible refers to a dynamic target refer to an explicit you branch using the externals are copied verbatim since they are really just properties attached to the some of the other svn commands and actually interpret the when you tag a you really want to preserve the state of the project for all this means that you have to the externals to a specific revision so you need to change the externals definition to explicit refer to the revision that you want this solves one facet of the you have to maintain multiple incompatible branches of the common then you have to specify which branch you want explicitly along with the to this can be a bit of a luckily someone out there in subversion land write the script that automates some of this we are still have struggling with some of the difficulties supporting this in a field deployed product with a bunch of shared code and a mandate of three different versions in the field at any you do go down this then be sure to consider how you will maintain the linkages as the projects grow and found that a little bit of time thinking about a process will go a long way

 used to be in the question would be very useful is a non trivial example of an app which uses events it really helps testing so far use events or publish number of classes can be notified when an event is subscribing classes do not need to know how the metronome code and the metronome does not need to know what they are going to do in response to the publisher and the subscribers are decoupled by the this is highly desirable as it makes for more flexible and robust the metronome can change how it detects time without breaking any of the subscribing the subscribing classes can change how they respond to time changes without breaking the the two classes spin independently of one which makes for code that is easier to static void setup the metronome and make sure the eventhandler delegate is metronome metronome new wires up the method to the eventhandler listener listener new listenerb listenerb new class a so every time tick is the runtime calls another in this case and public event eventhandler virtual so can override default behaviour in inherited classes protected virtual void null guard so if there are no listeners attached it wont throw an if public void while because using eventhandler need to include the sending object and eventargs although we are not using class public new private void eventargs class public new private void eventargs heard article writing on my some of this text is from

 used with boolean operands the operator is a logical operator just as but the difference is that the operator does short circuit evaluation and the operator does means that the second operand is always evaluated using the but using the operator the second operand is only evaluated if the first operand evaluates to result of the expression is always the same for both but if the evaluation of the second operand causes something else to that is only guaranteed to happen if you use the a b x 0 here b is still as the operand was not y 0 here b is as the operand was evaluation of the operator can be used to write shorter as the second operand only is evaluated if the first operand is instead of writing like has to be at least three else if has to be at least three can write like null has to be at least three second operand is only evaluated if the first is so you know that you can safely use the string reference in the second operand as it can not be null if the second operand is most cases you would want to use the operator rather than the if the first operand is there is no need to evaluate the second operand to get the a lot of people know that you can use the operator with boolean so they would get confused when seeing it used that way in the

 user data denotes the primary key denotes a	
 users are involved mostly when there is no there is only the illusion of not a lot you can do about you could have security questions but even they are prone to exploitation since some people put everything out in the public channels like email offer a reasonable solution to the if the user requests a password reset you can email them a password reset still not as others have but exploiting this would require the attacker to be somewhere in the line of sight between the its mta and the users technically easy but i suggest that the reality is just too much for them to bother on anyone except very high profile the user to supply ssl or gpg public keys at account creation time will help but clueless users know what those things are be able to keep their private keys secure and backed up so they lose the user to supply a second emergency password of like on mobile phone sim could help but likely the user would use the same password twice or forget the second password unless you want to educate your users on security and then hit them with a cluestick until they realise that it is necessary to be secure and the slight amount of extra work is not simply there to be a pain in the

 uses while it uses il as an intermediate has compiled to native il is never directly interpreted for execution as java bytecode you can even the il before if you really want to performance is normally better the long if you idea that is slow is some of the are but if you know what doing itself is a very speedy in this day and age it generally comes down to the algorithm language choice help you if you implement a bad bubble if helps you use more efficient algorithms from a higher level in my experience it generally that will trump any of the other speed on your i also want to explain the compilation path is compiled to this il is distributed to local a user runs the and that program is then to native code for that machine the next time the user runs the program on that machine running a there is also a jit optimizer that can muddy things a but the general reason you do it this way is to allow individual machines to make optimizations appropriate to that you end up with faster code on average than if you distributed the same app to first thing to note is that you can to native code before distribution if you really want at this point close to the same level as if you had distributed a native that stop a determined also largely misunderstands the economics at someone might perhaps your but this assumes that all the value of the app is in the very common for a programmer to the and undervalue the execution of the interface connecting with and if you do all of that a little extra competition will help you as much as it hurts by building up demand in your if you do it hiding your algorithm save more worried about your app showing up on warez even more show up there a much better strategy is to those the the biggest impediment to adoption is that the framework redistributable has become mammoth in hopefully address that in a relatively near

 using sql server 2005 to track a fair amount of constantly incoming data updates per we noticed after it has been in production for a couple months that one of the tables has started to take an obscene amount of time to table has 3 autonumber guid generated before the insert used to group the types the type name of the queries we run is a distinct on the distinct from with field has a ascending index on the table contains approximately 200m records at the when we run this the query took 5m 58s to perhaps not understanding how the indexes but i think we them test this a little we ran the following distinct from top 1000000 from with as query returns in about 10 as i would scanning the there something missing why does the first query take so my the first query returns 76 thank you thank you all for your it makes more sense to me now know why it without an doing a table scan across 200m with an doing an index scan across 200m server does prefer the and it does give a little bit of a performance but nothing to be excited rebuilding the index did take the query time down to just over 3m instead of an but not just going to recommend to my boss that we normalize the table thank you all for your distinct query in sql server over large

 usual pattern for a page you must have personally i hate is your download will begin if it the same with a instead of the either way should behave pretty much the meta refresh approach also but still the address bar changes to the url of the file and the underlying window is blank after the file is there a version online that can be when the browser is pushed to a direct file download by any normal method it should keep the previous page environment allow me to set so p3p is have to use headers to set p3p an html tag works just as why would you need if the target url is just serving a there is no need to set a cookie at so why bother with desperately trying to avoid to dodge any popup blocker you in response to a user there are no blocker that you should need to open a just to download a file i am beginning to think there is something highly strange about the file download destination you are linking not a file download at all but some kind of odd html web linking to a download is not you just link to the job you seem to be making this much harder than it intrinsically only usual problem with just linking to a file is that if it contains xml or an the browser will display it inline instead of downloading the only way to defeat this is using the either by serving it through a script that sets this or by configuring your web server to send that header for all file if you do either of those in your server there is no

 volatile keyword should not confused as to making and see for a better the manualresetevent does not have any bearing on the of and you have to manage that with this i am attempting to distill all of the information that has been put in various answers and comments regarding this basic question is whether or not the result variables and will be at the time the flag variable returns a assume that none of the variables are marked in this it would be possible for the result variables to be set the flag variable is set in like private void possibly work goes is clearly not what we so how do we deal with these variables are marked then this reordering will be but that is what prompted the original question the volatiles required or does the manualresetevent provide an implicit memory barrier such that reordering does not in which case the volatile keyword is not really i understand position is that the function provides an implicit memory barrier which fixes the that seem sufficient to the main and background threads be executing on two separate if does not also provide an implicit memory then the function could end up being executed like this on one of the processors with the volatile private void possibly work goes have searched high and low for information regarding memory barriers and the and i have come up with the only reference i have seen is the one wekempf has made to jeffrey the problem i have with this is that the eventwaithandle is meant to synchronize not access to i have never seen any example where eventwaithandle is used to synchronize access to as to believe that eventwaithandle does anything with regard to memory i would expect to find reference to this on the this is a response to response to my managed to read the section from jeffrey book at from page 628 quotes this i should point out that whenever a thread calls an interlocked the cpu forces cache so if you are manipulating variables via interlocked you do not have to worry about all of this memory model all thread synchronization locks call interlocked methods it would seem as wekempf pointed that the result variables do require the volatile keyword in the example as shown since the manualresetevent ensures cache closing this there are two additional points like to my initial assumption

 was wondering if there are any source control systems that allow administrators to define custom keywords which are replaced on check in with different behaviours similar to or only familiar with svn and cvs which have a set list of but there would be applications for something like or sure there would be other use the idea would be to create a plugin architecture where the behaviour of a keyword could be defined or my question is is there a tool or open that already has something like doing it as a part of the build is a valid way of solving the however would cause issues if a developer did not do a build prior to imagine for something like if the build was not in sync with the source the value could easily be for keywords with more static behaviour though replacement on build is a valid source control systems that allow custom defined

 wasting two days with trying to make it decided to take a step back and ask a more basic because apparently something i know or doing requirements are need to make an http post a few over from website given the appropriate will return some simple html and a response show these really the i have a php sample that works and successfully connects to i also have a dephi application source that also and finally i have the demo application from the company that has the that also works of i need to do it through that that sounds so it is not testing purposes created a simple console app and a simple connect tried like 7 different ways to create an http all more or less the same different implementation using method when the uri begins with get a webexception saying that the remote server returned installed fiddler suggested by a so and investigated a little bit the the 404 is because i am passing something because as i mentioned the talk about the fiddler results url where i have to post the data this is the post values are server might return a lines response about the but the company is from a sample of a possible 200 100 200 20 autentificacion habido un problema en la ante el corrija sus datos de 1st one means and the 2nd one is auth you can see the task is quite only it if i use i see that some sort of ssl stuff going on in the connection and then everything works as far as handles all that stuff for us added the callback to always validate invalid i understand what doing i can the but what like to know is very can you make a post over ssl using and a httpwebrequest and later have the response in a for me when i say been googling and stackoverflowing for two i have any sort of the connection passes through my standard nothing my machine is inside a vmware virtual machine and is windows but given that the sample applications all work without an i cannot see that as a different samples the are available if anyone wants to take a look at appreciate any if anyone wants to try with a i have a demo user and i could pass you the for testing i only have demo user one they gave and why not pasting it i want to flood the user with tests tried the using post from over	
 way i understand it is that you want an internal clock which gets updated according to the progress the real clock then you would create something like mytime mytime return using inittime you set the current time you want to this gets linked to the system time at that moment in when you call gettime using that it updates the starting point with the amount of time i tested the code and you can either use the struct directly if you subsecond precision replace and by the gettimeofday and for ascii breakdown to anything else than a second counter you can still use the unix

 way to access the winhttp apis from is via the windows sdk name for the platform and using those apis you article you linked to suggests that installing the sdk is difficult the good news is its an old article from 2006 and things are much easier these just do the the latest sdk iso image from worry about it being called the for windows server also for server xp and to the on the select full installation and let it run for hour or goto start programs microsoft windows sdk visual studio registration windows sdk with visual studio may even be prompted to run the integration tool during installation been a while since i installed it so i recall visual compiler will then be able to find and in the appropriate as usual things are never as simple as they should emk has pointed out that the windows sdk configuration tool work properly with visual studio 2008 and crashes after installing visual studio 2008 details and workarounds are reported and

 way to handle this very flexibly is to have a build directory under revision not try and svn your actual home directory has its own inside this you keep a structure the makefile can contain logic for specializing files be heavier than you but if your actual setup is complex done this across 3 or 4 different unices at a then worth doing something like	
 way to learn	
 way to look at this concept is that the state is represented by the current page and the links embedded in traversing a link changes the state of the application which is represented by the next it is a little hard to the links that are available at any point in time define what actions are available based on the actions that have already this is one definition of current trick is to represent the available actions are uris which on a retrieving the representation associated with a uri implicitly performs the action and retrieves the representation that uris are embedded in the representation and the user understands the action associated with a specific the various http methods help define the that occur and specifies when no action is this is usually what people are getting at when describing the whole restful

 way you are doing it should work although using jquery to populate a div via the function may be a cleaner way to do in order to get your current implementation there could be a few things you want to look assume enablepartialrendering is true on your scriptmanager worth sure the eventtarget for the call is set up as an async trigger for your update panels or that it is inside the updatepanel if you are only using one here for returning false from the javascript code that executes in the onclick event handler if you have attached this to a to make sure the form is not being submitted normally by your browser when you click the

 we allowed to say support oracle until it supports the standard sql it seems the least way in many you force a single or maybe a unicode zero width space then you probably have to go the whole hog and use something implausible such as 32 to indicate that the data should be blank but because the dbms in use is

 we have a collection of events in this where each pojo is possibly different we need to process this using different rules for each pojo class if the classes of pojos are stable often just described the motivation for using the visitor because you want to do different things to your collection of you can create an abstractbasevisitor and extend it to handle the different things you need to will require putting a tiny wrapper around each with one wrapper class per pojo to add a function that calls back to the

 we have been adding automated tests to our existing java we majority of these tests are integration which may cover a stack of calls post into a servlet validates the request and calls the business business layer does a bunch of stuff via hibernate etc and updates some database servlet generates some runs this through xslt to produce response then verify that the servlet responded with the correct xml and that the correct rows exist in the database development oracle these rows are then also have a few smaller unit tests which check single method tests are all run as part of our nightly seems good because we are checking the boundaries of our servlet on one end and database on the if these then we are free to refactor or mess with anything inbetween and have some confidence that the servlet under test continues to problems are we likely to run into with this see how adding a bunch more unit tests on individual classes would that make it harder to refactor as much more likely we will need to throw away and are the pros and cons of automated unit tests vs automated integration

 we use code behind then there be any methods properties added to a so would web page have problems any of user properties so why would we need include a class name in can embed any code behind code in your in new mvc there be any code behind by i think code behind is just a nice way to separate one class into two partial class is used in code if you use code behind you can still inherited properties from base then by declaring a you will be able to access those properties

 web servers limit the length of the data that can be passed as part of the so the get request may break in odd ways that are hard to most server software logs urls in the access so if you pass sensitive information as in a get this will in all likelihood be written to disk in a rest get requests should have no they modify if just getting a resource by this makes but if committing changes to a you should be using or update for the http

 webformview type eventually calls there is not an overload or other function in buildmanager to take input from a stream instead of from a virtual if you do not want to implement iview you will need to actually unpack the files to disk so that they can be compiled by you could still distribute your dll as a single but the aspx files need to be produced in order for buildmanager to compile see for	
 week at mix the final version of was of the stated benefits of this framework separation of support for control over html and microsoft are being careful to tout this as being not a for web but given the advantages mentioned long will it be until web forms is considered to be a you were kicking off the development of a new web project why would you choose to use web forms instead of the mvc mvc made web forms a legacy	
 week my boss ask my team to evaluate for next of us working with webform since we have no mvc experience before all of my colleague are interest in mvc no luck our finally answer is believe although you are you can build a complex application in short but if you change to the development time will take every things need to using html no web and many question opening the firefox tab with forum for ask had see many times people say mvc provide better project management but if it is a complex web i can imagine there are hundred of tag in one and keep open controller to see what to and keep opening model to see the can say it is not mvc it because webform is strong mvc suitable to complex web

 well tried to solve that problem i wasted two month on a solution that tried to solve the zero overdraw as already found out you deal with all degenerated cases and have zero overdraw at the same can however use a hybrid yourself a routine that checks if the joins can be constructed from simple geometry without to do so you have to check the the width of the line and the length of the joined that are shorter than their width are a with some heuristics you should be able to sort out all the trivial know how your average looks but in my case more than of the wide lines had no degenerated all other most probably already found out that if you tolerate generating the geometry is a lot do and let a polygon csg algorithm and a tesselation algorithm do the hard evaluated most of the available tesselation and i ended up with the glu it was never crashed most other it was free and the license allowed me to include it in a commercial the quality and speed of the tesselation is you will not get delaunay triangulation but since you just need the triangles for rendering not a i disliked the tesselator api i lifted the tesselation code from the free sgi opengl reference rewrote the entire and added memory pools to get the number of allocations it took two days to do but it was well worth it factor five performance the solution ended up in a commercial openvg implementation btw rendering with opengl on a you may want to move the from the cpu to the gpu and use or tricks to remove the a lot easier and may be even faster than cpu

 wethercotes wizard stores the connection string when you set up the but that mean you make it how depends on which version you are but in general if you expand the files under your dataset you will find a file like or you can open those files and search for this is usually a private variable and is set in an init function in the can make the setting dynamic by adding code like the string get return if new that if you regenerate the dataset you will likely lose this section of and without refactoring the dataset you may have to add it to several

 what you are describing is not that you probably already have the requirements written in a functional document if you use a requirements tool like doors then you get those 2 for that you have to sell off your requirements to a customer then mapping the requirements to test cases is how do you prove the system does what it is required to do and each requirement is requirements to design sections has always been a mystery too only on very rare occasions does it add value as timing but the mere fact that you can prove the requirements are met by the test cases makes this mapping nothing more than a lot of one can argue that it helps the but imo the overhead costs much more than it saves and most of the mappings at this level end up being very arbirtrary of the 4 sections you the only one that requires an inordinate amount of time to maintain is the mapping to design i know it is easier said than but try to get your company process changed so you required to do the design section if you get it changed at the company then you can change the software development plan for the project to specify that you be performing that particular

 with most if the joins are relatively inconsequential a small number of joins on and you are storing especially complex it may be better just to stick with the more complex also a matter of in many cases the purpose of many joins is to bring together very disparate that data which varies widely in its relative it can add complexity and overhead to keep a pair table synchronized when a small slice of the data across a large number of pairs is system complexity can often be considered a form of performance the risk and cost to make a change to a complex system without impacting performance is often far greater than a simple best solution is always to what works as simply as you in most cases say this means create a fully normalized database design and join the crap out of only revisit your design performance becomes an obvious when you analyze the it will also be obvious where the problems lie and what needs to be done to fix if reducing then so be know when you need to

 work for a billing service that uses some complicated billing software for core we have all kinds of codes we set up that are used for tracking payment provider each type of code has a completely different set of data items that control what the code does and how it am tasked with building a new system for tracking changes made to these we want to know who requested what it was and and what the exact setup looked like for that the current process only tracks two of the different types of this project will add immediate support for a with the goal of also making it easy to add additional code types into the same process at a later my design conundrum is that each code type has a different set of data that needs to be configured with of varying so i have a few choices could give each code type own and build them considering we only have three codes concerned about at the this would be this concept has already failed or i be building a new system in the first also weak in that the code involved in writing generic source code at the presentation level to display request data for any code type those not yet is not a db schema capable of storing the data points associated with each code not only but what type they are and how they should be displayed list from an enum of some i have a decent db schema for this but it just feels overly complicated to query and and it ultimately requires a custom query to view full data in nice tabular for for each code type the data points for each code request as this greatly simplifies the database design and will hopefully make it easier to build the just set up a schema for each code then have code that validates requests to their transforms a schema into display widgets and maps an actual request item onto the what this item lacks is how to handle changes to the questions how would you do am i missing any big design any other to those current inclination is to go with the xml given the schema updates are expected but extremely infrequent less than one per code type per 18 should i just build it to assume the schema never but so that i can easily add support for a changing schema what would that look like in sql server 2000 moving to sql server but that be ready until after this project is supposed to be reason thinking xml is that some of the data will be enumerated drop down but i really need to query any of so i was thinking it would be easier to define this data in xml le point about introducing a whole new technology hit very close to we currently use very little xml slowly but at the moment this would look a little out of also not entirely sure how to build an input form from a and then merge a record that matches that schema into the form in an elegant it will be very common to only store a record and so i want to build the form from the record a topic for a different on all the comments so far xml is still the leading separate tables may be as good or but i have the feeling that my manager would see that as not different or generic enough compared to what currently design help with varying	
 work in a bigco as we have a growing curve here taking over both from vb6 and from there is and will be a lot of java written which is i really think that the will be technology is i understand why people go that but in a typical large shop it seems to be far too suggest instead of trying to combat java on the just look for the opportunities for where it is clearly better for a particular if you are writing a small app to do some crud used by 10 or less it makes a lot of sense in my mind to do it with winforms instead of as a webapp because so much quicker to write them and with so few users you have a distribution you also get the full integrated security thing if you use ad been the approach we have here it has allowed to penetrate all in other it is clearly better to go java team so any large company is going to have a lot of microsoft and a lot of javaesque hardware sitting around to run stuff on so it seem to me that in bigco it should matter much at all which of the two big platforms you sometimes is sometimes i think a big shop should foster think in a few we will be seeing python more like or ruby as a viable alternative

 working on an application that happens to be the bootstrap for an installer that also working the application makes a few msi calls to get information that i need for putting together the wizard that is my main which causes a progress window to open while the info is being gathered and then go away once then the wizard is set up and my problem is that the wizard from does not want to come to the front and be the active application without me adding in some calls to do solved the problem of bringing it to the front with the following code in my force window to lose the topmost status that the previous line gave problem is that i still figured out how to make the window make itself be the one that has the work in this i need something that will force the window to the top of the and activate preferably in as few calls as guess is that the progress window opened at the beginning by the msi calls is causing the main window to screw but i have no way to prevent that window from it make sense to hide because it lets the user know going on before the main window do i force my app to come to the front and take	
 working on an flex application which uses many gauges created in the objects internally consist of several small movieclips and have their own logic one of the initial requirements was that the objects have to be loaded at thus they were exported as not we ran into problem when we tried to duplicate loaded it turned out that movieclip class have neither copying constructor nor method that would allow us to clone existing this way end up loading an object every time from which involves a lot of is it possible that language like actionscript 3 have such a have we missed something if am i correct that the only solution is to use flash component make some custom components and include them as swc at compile external swfs in a flex application duplicating

 working on the backend for a flash game and i need to the data going into the game is going to be hosted on many sites in a banner the user will play the game in the advert then click through to the main site to save their the moment i am thinking along the lines of plays the game and clicks to submit their the the banner sends the score and the originating domain to a script on the main script check the domain is one of the valid domains the ad is being hosted everything is the script creates a hash of this score and domain and stores it in the database along side the script returns the hash to flash which cobbles it onto the querystring of a geturl which opens the main scoreboard page checks the referer to make sure it is one of the valid it is it then checks the database for the hash to if a valid user then fills in their details and the record is updated based on the time i checked flash send referer which kinda throws a spanner into my is there an already established pattern for this kind of sort of should i use in step what is the correct name for this kind of is it a a checksum or something understand that being a clientside flash will never actually be that but in my something like the above is about as dificult as going to make it to hack this kind of my main objective is to make it harder for people to find the url of the script that adds the score to the database and simply spam it with fake fraudulent submission to a	
 working on the gui point of the new version of is based around an most of commercial work done with appmaker has been the other porting macintosh applications to no reason why the same principles be applied in v2 had a very good importer for powerplant ui resources and traditional mac as it is only able to run on that code base has been discarded really want to and the final generator languge i wrote for appmaker v2 is an xml exporter which dumps the entire object model to an extended already have a xaml ui generator and am currently working on a cocoa xib generator one of the reasons for going to wwdc in the focus at this time is on suites before returning my attention to a gui wrote to allow powerplant applications to be compiled for windows a solution needed because no other framework or tool at the time would perform well enough for the hardware since discussed an opposite program with someone i could chase up and sure an mfc portability layer could be created to map to cocoa whilst many developers have a poor opinion of the heavily api sits on top of a reasonably clean oo is the kind of project where you need to think about maintainability do you want something which ends up as large chunks of mfc code working with cocoa or do you want to migrate to an idiomatic cocoa further discussion should probably be taken off so contact me at dent at but happy to debate technicalities and feasibility on the combination of code generation and skinny framework adaptor layers works better than most people

 working through the opengl if opengl is new to is negating the effect of use to achieve independent the spheres are no longer then you need to provide your viewport and projection matrix setup code so we can determine the on the other if you have not setup the viewport and projection at all then see the tutorial above and fix you are rotating the matrix by 80 degrees every time you render the is that the intended how frequently is this function i would consider maintaining a desired rotation in a variable and then loading the identity matrix and rotating by that angle on each pass for angularvelocity is also ambiguous whether you are calling this function only once and expecting the glrotate call to continuously update the scene very incorrect or are calling this function repeatedly to render the animated if it is the former then please read the tutorials i linked to if it is the latter then you should consider performing the file once and building a to be called in the render

 works by fading a solid color rectangle in and out instead of fading the actual this works especially when you wish to control the color to which the component should sometimes you need transparency and thus must use there is a little trick to get fade to work neatly with both device fonts and embedded use a blur filter with no when you set a bitmap filter the player internally creates a bitmap copy of your object to which it then applies the if the blur is set to not so to it will still look good and be able to fade perfectly this breaks the zoom feature of the player though since the text is now

 worry about garbage collector is and never had a problem with not closing read operations at you did want to explicitly close the just store the in one then call on for you can use the which was added in python as a and added in python import for python not required for as print as print file will automatically be closed at the end of the there are other more important things to worry about in the snippets you mostly stylistic try to avoid manually constructing paths using the module contains lots of methods to do in a more you are using two variable and both of which are is a good tool to spot things like in this case it would give the redefining

 would add column to your table and update value each time new record is inserted or then you will be able to get data from the table based on that from where	
 would add that it is unlikely for you to find lower level functions like these in the if you were confused as to why the suggestions both pointed to then you probably could use some details on there are ways to define functions that them to windows api functions that do not exist within assemblies they are typically implemented in and available as a standard this process is considered to be platform can be a bit wobbly at first to match up all the data types between and style but there are others out there that have paved the suggested has a over at this wrapper when available in your will allow you to call sendinput as if it were a is basically a pinvoke wiki for well known api calls in and typically has a wrapper of api	
 would add that you also need to instantiate an instance of the class for your project addtion to adding a reference to the namespace as noted by easiest way to do this is to drag an inputpanel control onto your windows form in design whatever you name your inputpanel instance would be what you reference in the event handlers for your form	
 would agree with but as you commented on my answer if you have no grouping column and several entries in your table it will be difficult to find a matching you have only one ip entry 4 then you the lineid in to the 4 lines the first solution can be used to parse several ip but it needs sequential inserts in the	
 would agree with i have used many reports engines but when i used i look else would add about has support for delphi is faster than they delphi 2009 before other took longer and cases too much time access any report components or use any inside your you compare fr with others it has much features with lower file format is a for web has very powerful script engine with more java end tool without extra think you need standard version or	
 would agree with your initial idea on this one however it does depend on the create the base rule and add to the stylesheet with exceptions to that example if you are sure that a table within a table will definately never need the same style applied to it then use the selector to set the if however that may only occur once then set a class on the parent table and amend your selector to be something along the lines of should be changed to a descriptive name for the like calendar as that is what it you should not name a class after a particular style because if the style changes it makes no sense any	
 would also add c j other book on	
 would also consider not showing dynamic pictures since neither the server nor the client can effectively cache these	
 would also go for the single view option as provide specific properties on your viewdata to indicate what to if for	
 would always suggest knowing at least one only be it even if you do most of your developing in an if more productive in an ide than in another then by all means use the my reasoning is say installing a graphics driver on and the driver is not being your version of x start correctly using the new and you need to edit your x you could copy the backup of the working configuration over the edited start use a gui editor to edit the x and then restart or you could do the edit very quickly using an editor that depend on x command

 would assume that of the sharepoint means you use visual studio to extend not sure whether using sharepoint designer would count or sharepoint can be pretty powerful for something that requires no if trying to solve a complex the ootb sharepoint application will likely have some very rough you may also run into a wall where ootb functionality simply allow you to mimic a particular data structure or process in a useful you ever have to get into customizing and extending the learning curve gets sharepoint development takes some dedication to be likely become a primary focus of you or other programmers on your the book microsoft windows sharepoint services is a good introduction to the development side of you commit to make sure to get a fairly clear roadmap of where the application will be take some time to get familiar with the basic ootb features of wss3 has an virtual pc to make sure it will handle you want to clearly set up expectations for what you can and do out of the and how it will affect your team of programmers if you have to go beyond	
 would assume the equality operator actually compared the two strings hash rather than the actual content least as a the prefix matching would require a substring creation before hash value comparison then it follows that prefix matching should be much slower than full equality you have enough strings you need to prefix you should look into implementing a trie structure

 would be interesting to know a little do you create the imageprotocol is it a local variable or a class member or do you allocate it in unmanaged memory with is it sent to the c directly as stack variable or as a really tricky it feels like the delegate data is moved around by the gc which causes the access the interesting thing is that the delegate data type is a reference data which stores its data on the gc this data contains things like the address of the function to call but also a reference to the object that contains the this should mean that even though the actual function code is stored outside of the gc the data that holds the function pointer is stored in the gc heap and can hence be moved by the i thought about the problem a lot last night but come up with a

 would be the best to find a programmer that has already designed some known framework for the language in your users think is irelevent i becuase you judge about framework by asking arbitrary programmer his toughts about his answer will depend upon his level of knowledge and personal methodologies while api is being designed for wider population am assuming this is your to finish this in my firm programmers that use think that is lame language becuase of like you write button in and let the compiler automatically find default property for you want such person judging your designers experienced in different languages may be of help because wider used apis should be implemented with the help of well known programming patterns people are already familar

 would bet the linden labs will soon be supporting more languages than they have already moved to using mono to turn its lsl into it seems like a logical next step to allow other languages that can be compiled and run with mono to be perhaps putting a library or two out to support the built in this is my i think if they did open the languages available up to they will get more adoption and more interesting	
 would build the ancillary tasks into the first feature that requires is important to distinguish the difference between the product backlog and the sprint the product backlog contains user stories that represent not when a story is selected for a the story is then broken down into the tasks required to build would be a task for the items to no harm at the sprint planning level for tasks to have dependencies in most of the time there will be tasks that make life easier for other product backlog that

 would consider the possibility of it being a linq2sql bug with self referencing its a wild but i recall linq2sql documentation saying somewhere it support it that perhaps there its the linq2sql designer that gets the generated properties you you can tell it has it backwards candybar has is pointing to instead of the other way look at the generated code for other relations that work you confirm it and that by them in the designer sets them open the properties of a working association in the designer and make sure to have the association between candybar and deliciouscandy configured in the same

 would definitely go for and the code you write once will compile and run without problems on mac and the new ide that comes with qt qt creator is works and looks the same on mac and you need to anything else to start writing tried wxwidgets but find good the best one was code blocks but gui designer is not perfect and has different problems on different systems and the ide itself is still under heavy options are java and but those are not those are platforms although you need to compile code for each platform there will a lot of different issues on the	
 would definitely use mmap for the this would make it easy to directly access the data and flush to disk when the only thing you would have to control is where the file is mapped in the address so you can move it possibility for memory management is to create a different file for each and use level defragmentation rather than implementing it you never mentioned what you are but if it already has online defragmentation i would use if you are using linux and can use you can use i would expect defragmentation to be highly optimized and it would take a lot less effort than to implement on your own in one big

 would doubt one of the main ideas of a source control is that a repository does not loose any you delete the best you can do is get an older version and overwrite the current one with but the history logs will still show your what kind of ide are you using that does something like	
 would essentially write the same as you static this int32 return checked it with one of my entity framework models and it i assumed a simple many to one relationship as your code note that this is a bit confusing many parents for one could it be that you have a many to many one parent might have many childs and one child might have multiple then the proeprty in your would be a collection and the code must be changed as static this int32 return third posibility is one parent with many the second method will work for this case but always return at most one parent assuming the child ids are	
 would favour a third into two but do not by are less they require the user to become aware of two options and figure out what the difference between them and if so to also check the documentation or the code to ensure which is would have one function that takes the one that is called or something like that naming becomes easier with real this violates the responsibilities for rule gives it a long i believe this is preferable when your function really does do two things vector and foo	
 would give a try to something paste something to your actually makes the event loop of the qt application process all pending events something that happen if you call as in your first example and is very similar to what you do in your second one were you actually do something equivalent with a timer i tried it though and this is also way off what the documentation suggests the clipboard as a response to user input	
 would go with me compound key is obviously the correct way to go in so far as reflecting the meaning of your data no i have had all sorts of trouble making hibernate work properly unless you use a single generated primary key a surrogate i would use a logical and physical data the logical one has the compound the physical model which implements the logical model has the surrogate key and foreign

 would go with the second like have the name of the table in the primary but it need to be on every also mentorid would be how name a foreign key as well mentor is the name of the table pointing way the mentorid field in the student table has the same name as the mentorid field in the mentor some people like it because it can be a bit confusing when joining but i prefer to explicitly name the tables of the fields in joins

 would not create a thread for every inserted instead i would have a single cleanup thread or use a timer when the thread wakes up it can walk through the list cleaning up old would also overide the index operator and any other accessor methods to not allow items that should be cleaned up but have not yet	
 would not expose repositories directly to the the first big problem as you mention is you trust the so you cannot expose your data access api to potentially hostile your repositories with services on the server and create a thin delegate layer in the client that handles the remote your entities is not necessarily a bad practice just that it becomes problematic when you start to factor in things like lazy sending data over the wire the client if you write a dto class which wraps one or more entities and delegates calls you can actually build up a dto layer pretty especially using code generation available in most key to all of this is that a set of patterns should really only apply to a part of your not to the whole the fact that you have rich logic in your domain model and use repositories for data access as part of ddd should not influence the client in any conceptually the rias that i build have three uses something like mvp or mvvm to present the the model layer eventually calls i might call the this is a contract of services and data objects that exist on both the client and server to allow the two to usually the ui design drives this layer so that only the data that the client needs is passed to it and data access can be one method call for all the state needed for this set of using whatever it wants to handle business logic and data this might be ddd or something a little more old like a data layer built using stored procs in the db and a lot of or point really is that the client and server are both very different animals and they need to vary in order to do you need a layer inbetween that is a fair compromise between the needs of the ui and the reality of how things might need to be on the one big advantage that and javafx have over flex anything is that you can use a lot of logic in the first two because you have the same vm on both sides of the flex is the best ui technology hands down but it lacks a server component where code could be shared and more	
 would not typically organise your sql database in quite this what you are describing are two entities that have a a meeting can have zero or more to model this in sql you would use three a meeting a participant table and a meetingparticipant the meetingparticipant table holds the links between meetings you might have something like this any sql syntax table meetingid name location table participantid firstname lastname table meetingid participantid populate these tables you would first create some into into into create a meeting or insert into insert into now add some participants to the into into into into you can select all the meetings and the participants for each meeting meeting m join meetingparticipant mp on join participant p on above should participantid location firstname 1 room 1 tom 2 room 1 dick 2 room 2 dick 3 room 2 harry you want to find out all the meetings that is in you would write something like meeting m join meetingparticipant mp on room room have omitted important things like primary keys and missing attributes such as meeting but it is clearer without all the	
 would not use selenium for this type of test and suggest that you solve a variety of testing issues with different what we do unit tests to test methods and tests to test how application components hang simple functional test framework like canoo webtest some to assert things like http cache basic page simple redirection and cookie setting tests to ensure validity of pages to w3c to test javascript classes and methods we created to test ui and the integration of those worth spending time breaking out the responsibility of testing different aspects of the system using these different tools since using only selenium can cause bigger the the slower they indeed selenium is inherently slower compared to the other tools handles testing well but nevertheless xpaths can be brittle and may require increasing amounts of time and effort to requires you setup data with your app to step through user scenarios can be messy and take a lot of are also some techniques which you may or may not have come across which you can use to make your selenium tests	
 would not use this method of conditionally inserting line if there is a possibility of something that might be a single line or use an html element that is used for and preventing but use the intended this could making them either or could also use but that caused side effects like float clearing that add nothing to your specific best to use the correct html and proper classnames and css to get the markup that you for some ideas on this	
 would personally recommend using this is the next gen command line from microsoft and sits right on top of it was built to do items like batch edits across large sets of	
 would personally upgrade not just the ide but the target framework if you possibly the benefits of being able to use linq are huge in my for a wide range of you really want to stay with you can use the option of vs2008 explained by but be aware that really means if you accidentally use a type then your code run on a vanilla if using can still use most of the	
 would prefer the i adding something in the url creates the however that collide with a query string parameter that an app wants to a custom header would be third option could be to have ssl connections redirect to a different say so on the back end you know that port 80 connections were http to begin and port 8080 connections were 443 to begin even though both http at that	
 would presume that when one property changes it is indicating that it may have had an effect on another thereby resulting in that property firing an update as quite property change events fire for an object even when it changed because the developer want to actually check for a and so just fires the event in scenarios where it might have my gut instinct suggests this may be what you are it could also be that whatever is listening the the propertychanged event is not actually checking the name of the property that has this would also cause the same	
 would probably override the and methods on the controller class basecontroller controller called before the action is public override void start called after the action is public override void stop	
 would provide a neat solution to your depending on the user ask the user to fill more from your problem statement its looking that you know how many projects need extra fields and which do if you know this data then feed this data into a database and then accordingly generate your form however even if the data is available dynamically with the use of an interactive javascript and ajax you can easily achieve a neat	
 would rather use the following class to generate random prov new	
 would really recommend using stl or containers for you must use then i would recommend using a typedef to define the could also return then you would need to typecast it to the correct size in order to index it does not support dynamic multiple dimension as others have suggested you return an object on the stack local	
 would recommend doing asynchronous a little bit easier to set up and require you to create new threads programming is where you for a file stream you want to write to but does not want to wait for it to you might want to be notified when finished but you want to you do is using the and functions that are available on the stream your method you start by calling beginwrite with all the data you want to write and also pass in a callback this function will be called when beginwrite has the callback function you call endwrite and clean up the stream and check for will not block which means that if called from within an event handler that thread can finish that handler and continue processing more event as other gui private static filestream static void stream new const string mystring asciiencoding encoding new data sleeping 5 public static void sleeping is pretty important because the thread writing stuff will be killed if the main thread is killed this is not an issue in a gui only here in this small has a good on how to write this and also some on asynch programming in general in case you go for the or	
 would recommend going with something that has an perhaps the flickr is an library written to help with accessing flickr but not sure if this api call is	
 would recommend looking at which is what most modern distros are using to accomplish	
 would recommend queuing the which is then sent via a separate process a service or a worker its a bit more effort to implement but pays off in the long servers can go or be so forcing the user to wait may give them a bad experience with your for sending a signup verification you might also need to send additional email later if they verified for some say 1 this becomes easier with the infrastructure supporting a queued	
 would recommend taking a look at this eels which gives an example of another using the sample statefulobjectbinder it is possible to bind collections of business objects which must be retrieved from the since the controller is implementing you have access to a which can be used to hydrate the required objects and add them to the object	
 would recommend the jquery	
 would recommend using a hosted service for email you may find just the right software for the the main issue is a mailing service increases the chances of your mail reaching the it also provides very useful reports of how many opened and who clicked the price of those services is very much using and happy with their they have an easy to use so you can control your campaigns invoking it from java and in the process of packing my code to post it	
 would require spoofing a ip address in requests to your local instance of i think probably spend less time just making a demo build than trying to make that	
 would say definately would look ping commands between the two servers and see if there are any the servers are next to each other you should have 1 on the could be network traffic network cards not being configured for or other things some analysis on some queries and see if you can identify indexes or locking which might be a problem if any of the selects on the read database might be blocking the with and see if this makes a difference on one or two queries you have a complicated system which you have a problem you need to determine which component is the problem and fix replication is probably best if the reports selects you need to run need to be up to if they you could look at log although that would add some down time with each make sure on seperate drives so the performance is	
 would say it depends on what exactly you are trying to afraid you cannot avoid a post unless they support some query string variable or have a way of setting a in a cookie or that have to figure out by a standard you will have to mimic user actions in some form and which means sending initial get request to extract all form field and then creating a post to simulate the post this inside a regular browser would be i i remember if javascript allows to set headers and i guess you could use ms active if your goal is to extract data in some you can do it relatively are plenty of samples on how to use httpwebrequest or webclient for screen including simulating logins and i would use send a get get preserve extract form create a post recreate headers proper form proper post reassign and you should be see what needs to be i suggest using a fiddler run then browse to the click on a the filder will show you all traffic and all necessary information on both the initial request and subsequential post	
 would say that both will work equally well but the advantages of one over the other really come down to whats more convinent for how have your intranet site collection	
 would say that if you can you can then use it to multiply and divide using should i assume overflows will be simply seem to recall a method of adding variables using i am looking for that answer this will point you in the right if i can find that xor i will post it for it disjunction is often used for bitwise xor 1 xor 0 xor 1001 0111 is equivalent to addition without the reference	
 would say that if your database is storing a currency value it should be hanging onto the units at the same it sounds like doing that can you add the locale to the database at the same could be a decent	
 would say that the easier to use and more complete distros are debian and have been a redhat user i switched to fedora when that project started simply the open version of some releases are some are just but on average i have had much less critical problems than with other distros i have right now i am using fedora and since my mother has been able to use i guess they have made real progress in user interfaces and	
 would say that you cannot avoid either of these having few overloads for your parts and having a statement somewhere down the also having to modify your code when adding new class might be your only being said you can get help with some other patters namely factory that could aid you in the building also sensible use of polymorphism all parts inherit from the some type be it class or can reduce the amount of and this	
 would say use prefixes or suffixes for the names very close to hungarian which is widely regarded as even by the creators of it at the sole exception to this rule is which many regard as ok to prefix with but i am of the opinion that interfaces have a prefix you should group classes that are related into namespaces to prevent	
 would seem to be the sort of thing for which a hashtable would be storage and retrieval of hashtable entries is possible in and can be used quite effectively i would recommend trying something like the following a is effectively a generic available from this will be used to keep track of the occurrences of each keywords value will act as a bit each text file and read all the setting the appropiate bit for the corresponding text file in which the keyword is would vary from 0 to 3 in your over all entries in the looking for the appropiate value in your because you are looking for a keyword that appears in the files but the last the value you want to search for is 0011 3 in find this entry and you have your this algorithm runs in where n is the total number of keywords in all your text i think going to get better than that let me know if you need a few more i seemed to have missed the bit about your possibly containing more than one actual if these are known to be shorted than a certain number of then i think this solution may still be viable with small need something a bit more it would	
 would somehow use flash that would draw to a then encode them as an image then upload them to your a few minutes of i found has an activex	
 would start with the even a using sql compact as an offline data	
 would start with the the only tool you have is you treat everything like most important is to know many different programing languages and inform yourself well about the tools on your any problem can be solved in almost any language you be it full blown mainstream language with its huge default library or small specialized language like the first job of programmer is to determine what to use according to the specification of the some concepts provide better approach to whatever your main goal may be small code size you will finish like some of programmers who desperately try to do something in a 1 language they while the problem could be trivial to solve in different programming advice goes along with todays tendency for projects web applications for which may involve several languages in single like and even different programming paradigms introduced recently some concepts from functional programming the basic thing is	
 would strongly suggest using it is or recommended by can be very difficult to write a regular expression that works in all are some cases have to comment void comments can be foo void match signatures in strings underscores are but void identifier override void have to recognize defaults to explicit more comments signatures can span void void string forget the int approach will throw away everything that it so you will in fact lose all the that you are splitting forget that signatures can have commas in can be your current regexp could consume more than it is a lot of other stuff that can show up in so just because something is between two method signatures does not make it part of a method	
 would suggest getting a good editor so that you get bitten by for i just use packages which include an editor and all of the win32api they are pretty fun to get into if you have been using the win32api in python can be a little bit you need to do the whole ddlimport download activepython comes with open it and start entering some stuff at the you will pick it up fairly easy after using for some more interesting python try which has all sorts of which can allow you to very simply see different things that you can do with	
 would suggest going different compiling driver from using nice myself a command line person and using makefiles everywhere i find build utility not useful for complex is tons of limitation within ms build utility and i would recommend using vs environment for compiling your not sure if there is a howto in the but straight forward to integrate into vs custom build

 would suggest putting those tags back in and making sure it still if you want to take them do it one at a time until it i question the wisdom of taking them if your xml you should understand it if a xml you really be fiddling with it you understand it better	
 would suggest starting by migrating to first step would be to slowly refactor to move all the collections to generic this will help and ease the migration into the especially with it should also have a nice impact on your since any collections of value types will perform wary in this of converting hashtables to since the behavior is different in some but etc are useful moving helpers to static and potentially extension would be a good next step to this can make the code more	
 would suggest that you use one of the good ruby parsing libraries or you need to log in on the site you might be interested in a library like using hpricot puts using puts

 would use files with to widgets begruessen sie zu widgets your setup you detect the locale and require else if require gives you the benefit of constants and makes localization reasonably transparent to your application in that you have to do all over the if anything is just put it in the locale you want to add a locale file just copy an existing one and change all the references rather than trawling your codebase for can also put code in these files like correctly formatting numbers and dates for these locales the right names in each language but also the use of periods and so currency conversions and

 writing a module and want to have a unified exception hierarchy for the exceptions that it can this allows users of the module to catch those particular exceptions and handle them if but many of the exceptions raised from the module are raised because of some other failing at some task because of an oserror on a i need is to the exception caught such that it has a different type and so that information is available further up the propagation hierarchy by whatever catches the but i want to lose the existing and stack all useful information for someone trying to debug the a exception handler is no since trying to decorate the exception before it makes its way further up the propagation and the handler is too is partly solved by deriving my specific exception types from the existing type but that make it any easier to wrap the existing exception instance in a new nor modify the chaining and embedded discusses a change accepted in python for exception to indicate that a new exception was raised during the handling of an existing trying to do is i need it working in earlier python and i need it not for but only for what is the right way to do exceptions with a different type and preserving existing

 writing a system as the client is asking for a convenience your credit card told them that this is in all likelihood a i did have a good idea just and seeing that good ideas in are actually bad ideas i thought put it up for review here and see what holes can be punched through thinking of the credit card information plus some message signature using a one time pad generated per this pad is stored as a cookie variable on the next time that user tries to place a the pad is sent to the and if the server can properly decode its encrypted it shows the credit card information as already being cc info actually transmitted the server will never store the pad in anything more than memory or page in i intend to have the pad be sent once upon arrival on the cc page the server checks if it should ask for cc and once on cc submission to get the actual user will also be instructed that their information is in their cookie meaning that they will expect that if their cookies are their cc information is me know where you think this scheme is horribly client credit stored on server but with one time pad encryption stored in client

 writing it but keep in mind its weird to free the ptr by doing delete could be mistaken for a variable that was not created by should check out gotw for good practices passing around i dont remember which lesson it was was more then but reading through that is more valuable then anyone realize will be less of a should try writing code that never use i do it but once got stuck when i needed a container of there was no working around typically i used the stl containers and have most variable alive on the stack myclass or as a member and pass it around as quiet easy to remove pointers once you start passing reference instead of pointers and use stl containers instead of note that i never use list and map should do most of what you there are other	
 writing some code where i defined the following base virtual virtual int void void unsigned int double rtaudiostreamstatus void virtual void virtual void want to use this as a base class and not actually do anything with it on its so i have two seperate classes which are derived from this class i wanted to do this to simply provide some basic constraints as to what any derived chorus class have to be considered usable in my i build my project studio i get unresolved external symbol errors on all the virtual functions from this chorus guessing the typical error where i make forward declarations of these since they are virtual and i want them to actually be defined to do anything until they are defined within the deriving what do i do to resolve this virtual functions in a base	
 writing the entire then your reasons are your i can think of a few situations where you want to throw the exception and let the app most of them are not very good reasons best reason is usually when i frequently disable exceptions while debugging to allow me to know better where something is you can also just turn on thrown exception breaks in the debugger if running it on a machine with the possible reason is when continuing after an exception is thrown make sense or would result in possible irrecoverable data corruption or worse robots with laser but then you should be damn sure your applicaiton deals with these situations crashing the program is just the lazy writing api or framework code that you use then you have no idea if someone will catch your

 years ago i worked on a web site that grew in popularity beyond our initial expectations and it got us in trouble since we were all relatively inexperienced in web based projects it posed a significant strain on us about what to do beyond usual database separation onto separate load balancing day thought of something pretty since site was based on their profiles were stored in a database table the usual way someone would do it user lots of info variables and stuff like that which would show up as a users profile page which other users could look flushed all that data into a simple html already prepared as a users profile page and got a significant boost basically a i even made a system that when user edited their profile it would parse original html put it up for and then flush out html back to the file system got even more made something simillar with messages users sent to each basically wherever i could make a system bypass a database avoiding a insert or i got a significant it may sound like a common but it was an enlightening it is not an avoidance of relational setup per but it is an avoidance of the database altogether

 you are depending on external resources such as your database and the configuration files when using the you writing very effective unit you will have to keep everything in sync including the data in the this because a maintenance you want to test this i recommend setting up your configuration to have membership can grab this from your you then will also want to set up a test database to connect it needs to be populated with fake so need scripts to make sure the data is would however recommend that you take the approach of doing more proper unit when we refer to a we mean testing a very small piece of code at a this code should not depend on anything so what you need to do is use interfaces and use or mocks so that your tests scope is enclosed to a single unit of you want to go this route i highly recommend reading effectively with legacy there are also plenty of other books and resources which talk about how to find seams and decouple your code so able to test once you get the hang of unit testing be glad you looked into

 you are going from bright colour to bright colour as the hex values then you may wish to interpolate in rather than rgb hsv space approximates how we think about colour saturation and rgb space approximates how the light sensitive cells in our eyes upper gradient is linear rgb interpolation from ff0000 to its middle value is a muddy middle gradient is a linear interpolation in hsv as both ff0000 and 00ff00 are fully saturated and have the same value the interpolation keeps the same brightness and saturation so the centre value is bright yellow third alternative would be a vector rotation in rgb which would mean the is b4 hex 180 dec 255 which is somewhere between the two this is done by calculating the magnitude of each end then scaling the result of the rgb linear interpolation so it is the same effectively sweeping the vector in an arc in the plane of the two colours and the as we actually weigh different colours equally for or see not but it does have a fairly even intensity across its whereas the hsv one is a bit lighter in the as got two values at where you have hsb support the algorithm is simple get the hsb of the end linear interpolate them as in the other rgb then convert create a colour with the color hsvinterpolate float color color c1 hsv0 new hsv1 new float alt hsv0 hsv1 float h mix hsv0 0 alt hsv1 0 float s mix hsv0 1 alt hsv1 1 float v mix hsv0 2 alt hsv1 2 return v believe has the conversions built so the code much use color vectorinterpolate float color color c1 float alt double x0 double y0 double z0 double x1 double y1 double z1 double mag0 double mag1 double x mix x0 alt double y mix y0 alt double z mix z0 alt double mag mix mag0 alt double scale mag return new color clamp x scale clamp y scale clamp z scale int clamp double value int x round value if x 255 return if x 0 return return probably want to find the intersection of the vector with the edge of the rgb cube rather than simply clamping but in this case it matter either

 you asking if you can find out before you call malloc how many bytes are available for you to the answer is even if you the answer may not be very valuable to the reason why is you can never know how much memory is you can only know how much memory this is a very important distinction because it has an affect on the way you can properly utilize an lets assume there was such a function called this code looks correct but is horribly size size no need to check the answer because there is enough p reason why is that some other thread could come in between the if statement and the malloc statement and do own that could reduce the overal memory in the system and hence change worse is the available amount of memory in the system does not determine how much memory can be allocated with important for malloc any other memory alloc is how much contiguous memory is

 you can change the signature of your then try changing it const char const int int will result in a more reusable and more efficient added const qualifiers will make sure you mistakenly alter the input this function is a so i assume it is never meant to have suffix to compare against is passed in as a so you can save this function for later reuse with other signature will give you the opportunity to pass the lengths of the strings in if you already know we call this can define the function like const char const int int str suffix return str suffix return lenstr 0 lenstr lensuf 0 lensuf return lenstr obvious for the extra parameters is that they imply more noise in the or a less expressive

 you can do not sure if call it a best but certainly a good idea to make rather rudimentary arrays a bit more if you need dynamic almost a requirement to group the various fields needed to do the bookkeeping you have two sizes in that one and one this is a tradeoff where you trade fewer allocations for some paying with a bit of memory times arrays are only used and are of static which is why the operator is so handy to determine the number of your syntax is slightly off with by the how it usually i sizeof array sizeof do stuff with each that is not a the parenthesis are not always one example of a wrapping exactly as that which you describe is the type provided by the part of the declaration is exactly what you struct gchar guint are expected to use the provided api to access the array whenever not poke these fields

 you ever been frustrated by visual studio not certain watch expressions when stepping through code with the have and does anyone here care about pure methods with no so many great things about that i but i write pure that static methods with no if you were to build your own compiler where you could write something like int somereftype int int return only is the above a free i call it a the function is assured to not have any the keyword could here be used to indicate just and provide a contract for pure these kind of functions can always be without causing side this being a way for visual studio to always evaulate my functions in the despite the faulty assumpation that all method calls and user operators have side a method where all the parameters are copy by value can never have side visual studio fails to recognize love for what you can do at and i miss these things in i think is dumbing down on the user a bit and basically not allowing certain hurting many things which actually relate what you can do at compile like to actually see more meta programs which are programs run by the compiler to compiler your original while has booleans and allow things like a obj as it generate the approriate i did some digging around and noticed how fails to generate approriate il for branchless for example y 1 an il instruction for just that which the compiler you or be instrested in an which looks like but is something entierly more and more and totally in terms what you can do with of methods in evaulation and custom

 you have two bounding boxes with some arbitrary orientation i assume means some then i would do the at an initial position i assume the bounding boxes are not translate each box forward based on its velocity applying movements over the coordinates of the corners of each translated bounding these 4 coordinates define the endpoints of the 4 line segments that make up the edges of the bounding bounding box test for an intersection between each of its line segments and the 4 line segments of bounding box you can do this using standard equations for computing the intersection point of two as discussed for there was an figure out the fraction of a move that was successful using the coordinates of the intersection points and the known translation you the above steps for each a rough pseudocode what was discussed in the would look as for intersections between the obb any intersections are code for when obbs are partially p line segment whose endpoints are the obb for intersections between p and obb if p intersects edges of both code for when obbs are not code for when one obb is completely inside the	
 you have two user controls with the same file name in diferent folders of your web sometimes will cause this i set the site to debug the never the compiler batch when it does batch compile and may cause this read this is a conversation about the same if your application is in then april pm by robbie coleman we did an error for a usercontrol that reported it could not load class due to versions in the temp identified that we had two controls with the same file name diferent folders of the same web the also had diferent namespaces never through this exception until set we even wiped temp directory clean on only way we could fix the was by renaming the ascx file of of the this was there a way to fix your have been very helpfull to development and we appreciate all the information have given if your application is in then april am by tess hi for the nice am assuming that you are defined in multiple definition or problem basically occurrs if are using src rather than and your cs or vb files contain definition for exactly the same in exactly the same error is really the same as what would get if you tried to compile dll with another class defined in the same reason i am saying it happens you use src is because if you use codebehind you would have an error at compile the usercontrols are really same i would avoid creating a and instead using the one from other if they are different would either give the different if and if make that the source classes are different such reason you are seeing it now not before is because you are everything into this

 you override you basically become responsible for making sure that your nested controls get created approach seems pretty for your simple i do not think you need to be calling if you picked this up from the msdn docs on the take another look the property example that they give is retrieving the text value from one of its child which means that the property accessor needs to make sure the child controls cannot guarantee when someone might access your which is why you would put in calls before any access to a control in your controls in a normal page will get called when gets around to adding your composite control to the this may not happen until prerender on the first page load if nobody touches your control and it databind or subsequent createchildcontrols will be called during viewstate or any code might touch off a composite control to start creating child will do it for example and this could happen in that i think on the right

 you should consider creating custom activities for each of the major the custom activities will be composite activities that can be composed of many this will help things a bit and allow you to continue working with the workflows at a relatively workflow while is not really designed to scale very as of vs the best way to work with technologies is to use the text editor and the xml it down into several workflows not be the best approach unless you can break it down into a few activities and are working at the xaml keep in mind that if the logic and flow is nearly identical for all of you will now have to maintain 6 different this is a nightmare if your workflows are complex and you need to fix a common logic error across all of should also consider the use of the this may allow you to have one workflow and one set of but the implementation of each step can be isolated into a in this you would need to instantiate one workflow per load the same workflow into and inject different not necessarily the best but something to

 you want to process an xml document in its parsing xml into a dom will almost always be the least efficient in terms of deserialisation cpu usage and memory to a dom requires around times the amount of memory as the xml document requires disk for a 1 megabyte xml document will parse into a dom taking up megabytes of ever parse into a dom if you intend to modify some or all of the data and then put the result back into an xml for all other use dom is a poor is often significantly less resource but this does depend on the length of the document how many elements you and the location in the document of the data in which you are memory usage and completion time tends to increase the further down the document you for say you have an xml document with childnode each childnode has a unique identifier that you know in and you want to extract a known childnode from the extracting the childnode would use much more memory than extracting the if you are using xpath to extract all childnode you may find it less efficient than parsing into a xpath is generally an easy way of extracting a portion of an xml not recommend using it for processing all of an xml far the best if you are indeed looking to extract and process all data in an xml would be to use a this will be both orders of magnitude faster and less resource heavy than any other it does also depend on the volume of data you are dealing for the example xml document you you notice any practical dom will be and sax will be but talking or can easily be hundreds or thousands of times faster than however if the difference between 2 microseconds and 2 milliseconds not going to when dealing with a document containing childnode 2 seconds versus 200 seconds will become more of a

 your grid bound or hard to tell from your but i imagine that if your are having this problem then probably the other answer is the button the recordnavigator that is built into the control or is it a separate the reason i bring this up is that i have seen issues in the vb6 applications i support where a toolbar will often intercept and interfere with how the janusgrid should get around this i have added the following code in the click handler of any toolbars where there is also a janusgrid control on the then way any changes are immediately applied to the current this does not then i have also seen problems where the recordset that is bound to the grid gets out of sync with the internal recordset in the you can check this by comparing the bookmark of the grid to the bookmark of the one point i may have also used something like you can try setting a breakpoint in the events of the to see what record the grid is really on when clicking on the

 your i think i see what you are trying to on the right track with although i would probably use in this because it has a property that allows you to use sql to specify exactly what record to it sounds like you want to implement a to type functionality in your where the user selects a record id from a list and the form changes to display the selected possibility is to switch to the new record each time the user selects an item in the you can handle this in the use a simple suppose you have a and a for records in the the has a combobox that is bound to the column via when you select a student id in the the will switch to display the corresponding student the event handler for the you can code this to functionality with something like the sub dim recordid as itemdata property will return the value of the at the specified recordid to the this assumes we want to use the same can change the form name if you want to open a different form user selects an id from the david fenton points out in the you can shorten the following the default value of the combobox in this case will be the value of the bound column at the current in this you could just remove altogether and code the event as sub

 your question has so the solution will here are two ways to do the quick and dirty way will only partially solve your issue because it be able to account for the more odd permutations like missing spaces or misspelled the quick and dirty a new table call a text field in it you want to replace it for this example all the char or char combinatios that you want removed in this and run the query that it will only remove at a but you can also versions of the in it too like this example i created a table called with a field called top 1 char from tchar where order by as better much more this explanation is going to be general because it would be next to impossible to put the whole thing in if you want to contact me directly use my user name at a table of qualifiers that people enter like of here you every wierd permutation a table with qualifierid here you would say goes to which a query that joins the your table with mistaken in use instr so say in the a second query the count field and use it as a entry with the highest score will have to hand enter the but pretty soon be next to none as you and more entries in the have a couple different in access there is no case in you need to use not quite as elegant as the solutions in the more robust db engines and needs to be nested for this but it will get the job done for as could also do it using the sql to limit your as shiptoplant btst left join select shiptoplant from btst where shiptoplant not as abtst on you know vb you can also create your own functions and put them in the that is another
