 3 million records is way too much to handle at my guess is that you are performing an export or something like that which requires that many records to be sent down the one method you could use to reduce this issue would be to have the generate an export and then deliver that file to the client compressing first using zlib or something you are pulling data back to the client for viewing then consider sending summary information and then allowing the client to dig thier way thru the data a portion at a the users would thank you because your performance will go way up and they have to dig thru records they care about looking records is way too much to handle at if you had that many would you be able to carry them but if you made it into larger you if your sending data to the client for a then i strongly suggest a summary give them the large picture and let them drill slowly into the send grouped data and then let them open up this is a search results then set a limit of the number of records to be returned for example to display 100 set the limit to still only display the last record means that there were more than 100 records so the customer needs to adjust thier search criteria to return a smaller

 a couple of issues going on when you are using sql notifying the workflow of events and having the workflow publish events is persistent and asynchronous and the underlying plumbing of the workflow is not in the way you might something horrible happens somewhere in the sequence of events that will eventually cause your workflow to transition to a new then the workflow will revert to the state it was in before attempting the activity this keeps the workflow in a consistent state since being is a bad a transaction scope as done above is but you have to remember that the only time transaction scopes actually work is when the classes within the using block are aware of the the transaction you can do is have your call to wrap things in a when something goes you can vote for a but this still the method on your you can give some specifics about what trying to accomplish at a higher there may be some things intrinsic to the wf that might better suit you than trying to shoehorn a transaction scope into the did some digging and found a couple of different places where we are told that is no api to manipulate the scheduler work unfortunately for us what this means is that any sort of rollback behavior that we want going to have to implement by hand on our i knew more about why you were trying to rollback work queued through an edes i might be able to suggest some potential architectures for accomplishing your task without the wheel times out of 10 when i run into problems like this where it looks like wf just support what trying to the problem is because either kept too much code the workflow or tried to put too much code it and refactoring where my work is done often fixes my problem without requiring me to write new

 a diagram that should make things more developing a plugin for another program that adds relationships and properties not already included in the these are defined in my tree trying to define this structure abstractly so that i could create implementations of the plugin for different as well as access the information from multiple implementations in a single methods are defined in the but the framework does not know about all the i was hoping i could avoid having the implementation projects pass a list of types to the methods in the framework but it seems i avoid i guess that make sense the methods must have access to the types they are this really explain the problem with as it is a concrete class in the framework i think what is happening is when i serialize the datacontractserializer has access to all the objects and their knowtype parameter and saves them but when i deserialize i create my datacontractserializer with dictionary as the so it only knows about but not the derived classes of tell it what all the derived types are because like i said they are in other projects that the framework project know soooooooo seems like the best solution is to have each implementation pass a list of node types it uses to the serialization and deserialization methods in the framework this make is there a better way to do

 a is what you get when you put the three the model handles the data the view handles the actual html the user sees and the controller decides how they interface together to show the desired my choice as to use a separate controller or another method to an existing controller hinges on how close the operation is to the other that i say i wanted to have a useradmin now that would handle adding a deleting a changing if i was adding functionality that dealt with changing a account in some way i would most likely put it in if i had separated them out into their own i would naturally add another controllers allow you to house similar tasks together so they may leverage what is already in the rather than having to recreate what has already been a lot of it is how the programmer thinks it should be what makes sense to you may not make sense to that is the the

 a lisp programmer i would wish that the java community understands the following as objects can be named or but they can also be objects of this allows functions to be passed around as returned from functions or stored in data this means that functions are first class objects in a programming functions add much to the they just allow you to write functions in a shorter closure is a function plus a binding closures can be passed or returned return this allows the function to refer to variables of its even if the surrounding code is no longer you have in some then the question comes up what to do about there are languages that have but not in the functional programming world a and b as is nowadays the smalltalk had are anonymous for a long but then some dialects of smalltalk added support for as can imagine that you get a slightly different programming model if you add functions and closures to the a pragmatic view the anonymous function adds some short notation where you pass or invoke that can be a good closure plus allows you for example to create a function that has access to some variables example to a counter now you can store that function in an access it and invoke the context for the function object is now not only the objects it has access but also the variables it has access to via this is also but you can see that variable bindings access to object variables now is an when should be something a variable can be accessed in a and when should it be a variable of some object when should something be a closure or an you can use both in the similar a usual programming exercise for students learning scheme lisp is to write a simple object system using result is a more complicated programming language and a more complicated runtime too

 a mistake to assume that learning c will somehow automatically give you a better understanding of programming in a lot of cases even c is too high level to give you a good understanding of efficiency classic is versus so perhaps most people know the implications about performance between these two but learning c magically teach you this by guess i understand arguments about when string operations are made deceptively people often use them in inefficient but knowing that strncat exists give you a full appreciation for the efficiency a lot of c programmers probably even thought about the fact that strncat has to do a strlen operation using important to understand going on behind the scenes if efficiency is a people who know c tend to view things in a assembly and machine code are the building blocks of while c is a building block of higher level specifically but obvious that c is to the than many higher level this has at least two efficiency concerns as hidden behind implicit and easier to screw you want a specific example of how knowing c gives you an i think there is i think what people when they say this is that knowing going on behind the scenes in whatever language happening to write for helps you make more intelligent decisions about how to write a mistake to assume that c is going on behind the in for

 a to an is something known in the c standard as a arithmetic so not an reason compilers often issue a warning on this by default is because so commonly done in code there would be far too many warnings issued in there is an awful lot of code out there that works with values to deal with things that are inherently unsigned buffer sizes for also very common to mix signed and unsigned values in not to say that these silent conversions responsible for it might not be a bad idea to enable the warning for new code so from the i think probably find it rather overwhelming to deal with the warnings issued by existing

 actually compiler a few people here are saying as easy is unfortunately only half of the yes that would space on the but there are a couple of the compiler had emitted references other to instead of if you compile with then need to be even with frame compilers do this by space allocated with must when the function big one is point because you the compiler to emit code to symmetrically add to at every exit point of the most likely case is the compiler offers some intrinsics which allow library writers to ask the compiler for the help in glibc implementation of the implementation of is simply define thinking about the minimum i believe would be required would be for the compiler to use a frame pointer in any functions which usees regardless of optimization this would allow all locals to be referenced through safely and the frame cleanup would be handled by restoring the frame pointer to i did some experimenting with things like do char unfortunately not after analyzing the assembly output by it appears that optimizations get in the the problem seems to be that since the optimizer is entirely unaware of my inline it has a habit of doing the things in an unexpected order and referencing things via the resultant push mov sub sub this and the line below are our mov dword ptr mov ptr mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via esp call 8048338 mov ptr mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via call 8048358 mov ptr mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via call 8048368 you can it so i stand by my original assertion that you need compiler

 actually think this is a pretty good there are a few ways of looking at this could be seen negatively for one one thing you can do in a normal interview to sort the wheat from the chaff is ask them what they know about your company and the good that are keen to work for you and generally eager and have looked you up and at least gone to your website you have and found out what it is you so by asking them this upfront you are losing the opportunity to see how much initiative they of course you make up for this in other areas eg by asking questions that a reasonable person may have looked up other potential negative is that it can often be hard to understand an a business or a product from the outside looking i worked in for and not until you get to a place like that that you can see all the different teams new call centre and so and get an understanding of what they do and why they do understadning the culture is also hard without being a part of brann is right in that you want someone who is capable of understanding it rather than someone who actually you might be excluding good potential hires who will pick up your business quite being i like where going with the forcing a candidate to think about things like that is a good perhaps you could narrow the focus to a single aspect of your which is more digestable in a typically this will also allow you to give you the opportunity to see how much initative they took beyond the scope of the original	
 actually what you do is to deal with conditional is when a get request does go from client to asking you have anything newer than and the server say 304 if do avoid the server generating the and the traffic of the js however the cost of the request is sending an http request from browser to is still stuff is being handled by the headers for one for the etag is a different thing that is when the browser decides not to issue the get request at it is being managed by the header or the might have a header being setup somewhere and it makes the client disregard the setting or something like and see if the request is being cached about fb instead setup a breakpoint or logging on the server to be sure that not being said that when dealing with files you might not actual that is because if the browser does decide to say for a then you cannot force it to reload a new so if you deploy a new version to the the client see it until the week has no matter what the new time of the new resource is cuz it will never even issue the conditional get solution you really want to relieve network is to setup caching for maximum time a and when the resource you change the uri is add an arbitrary querystring this will force the browser to reload the new js and never bother the server at least until the next update next resource uri	
 actually wrote the code mentioned by airsource ltd at so pointing me to my own code much thx my but who use different screennames on different it was approved after submission to the and imho it is very useful when dealing with long paging is something commonly used on the and i like to force a user to scroll a list with i say what about agree that a horizontal swipe on a list enable the user to a row as a default but that i as a user am the of the i would expect to be able to delete but would i expect to be able to delete rows in a list of apps in the or a list of books in an amazon horizontal swipe on a list is just a depending on the it should do what the user would the scenario of a list with what would you show the first 25 rows with a me then have 50 and so in the have 527 unless you go you the table will draw choppy too on top of but even if scrolling this resolve the problem of scrolling 2000 miles of put a with page next thus only showing 25 rows at a then force the user to scroll to the top or bottom to switch to the previous or next open for any it appears just as a natural gesture to me to swipe left or right on something that has a

 advantage could be that using htmltextwriter one could format code in a cleaner maintenance and that htmltextwriter supports encoding html html new may argue that the code in the second example can be written in a possibly but this could be seen as an advantage of htmltextwriter because it basically enforces one canonical way of formatting again improves in i actually made a mistake in the second and i needed to go back and fix the this confirms the point i wanted to	
 advantage is that if you have many calls to these functions in your it will quickly become tedious to have to repeat the calls over and over returning the out pointer makes it possible for you to do things your new the equivalent code is quite a lot more	
 advantage of declaring it const is that you modify it in an obscure way which code inspection might for example by passing it by reference into a function which modifies its arguable disadvantage is that you pass it into code which takes reference that it actually if you really believe in this is actually an advantage in because it encourages you to make the rest of your code but if you have to make quick changes when or if already published the api and change then it looks to you like a darn good functions are then you really need to tell you whether or not a local variable is going to be explicitly modified by you can see all the uses of the variable right in front of but in real where functions sometimes get and where people use reference parameters and sometimes even and where you want to read and understand code as quickly as then it can help a tend to use it when i and not sweat it if i i get most use out of it when i need to remove const from a that tells me that my original conception of that variable was and i need to carefully check that no expression using it actually relies on it not given that has the const if going to write code that relies on a variable not you may as well get the compiler on your usually not worth worrying about compiler a good compiler can tell that if you modify a and take any references to then it can apply appropriate optimisations whether you mark it const or

 after much playing around with mapping files i have found an undocumented issue least i could find no mention of the error i was using subclassing the parent class cannot contain a mapping for a property that is the discriminator if you look at the second mapping document i posted it shows the super class and the sub the super discriminator is the objecttype i also map this as a property to the abstract class you cannot do once this line was removed everything worked correctly saving the bag seems to be an issue that is not controllable through anything i have found in i cannot find another instance of where the abstract class is saved through the it appears that nhibernate does not know that the linking class is a userinrole object and not a objectinrole researching all the options that are provided for the bag node there was no apparent way to tell nhibernate what type of class it was linking through to make the from what i can tell it but more or less treats the table as just a not a mapped if there was a way to tell it append something for the insert then maybe it would be but i have not seen any information regarding

 agree with charlie about tests corresponding more to user actions and the correctness of the system as a i do think there is alot more value to unit tests than just localizing failures more tightly unit tests provide two main values over integration writing unit tests is as much an act of design as if you practice test driven driven development the act of writing the unit tests helps you design exactly what you code should it helps you write higher quality code being loosely coupled helps with and it helps you write just enough code to make your tests pass your tests are in effect your the second value of unit tests is that if they are properly written they are very very if i make a change to a class in your project can i run all the corresponding tests to see if i broke how do i know which tests to and how long will they i can guarantee it will be longer than well written unit you should be able to run all of you unit tests in a couple of minutes at the

 all in the in many not databases will need some level of customization for individual but generalized databases can provide a basic level of it is possible to design something that is general enough to serve many basic but the problem is that that generality of design tends to lead to high for you can design your database to be for a large set of potential user but just better to customize the schema to the individual needs of the are significant tradeoffs involved in designing for a reusability usually they involve time and easier to design something that is not and the additional amount of time invovled in making the general design and using it is not worth the

 am assuming that when you make the call to execute the query you have the and you receive the so at that point you have it seems like you could do your analysis maybe catching things further what you might do is on your own custom subclass of add a triggeringsqlstatement member with a getter and and then at the place where you attempt to execute the catch the original exception from create a new set the triggeringsqlstatement to be the statement you just and call on the databaseexception to set the exception caught from postgresql as the cause of your then throw your databaseexception and the calling code which catches it will have an object that prints out a very decent stack trace of what happened plus provides access to the sql statement that caused the for more information on this you might want to research java exception even if you use all of what i just i think you should definitely be using java exception chaining not a spot anywhere in the code where you have access to both the sql statement that caused the problem and the exception that gets be very curious as to and how that is and suggest you redesign your code so that you do have such a since wanting to see the sql statement first thing in the you could probably also override your method other appropriate not sure what gets called when an exception is printed to print out the included sql assuming you included it as i described

 am currently tasked with creating a consistent architecture guide for software we have a lot of smart people doing the right but just not consistently and are using application architecture guide as a starting hence coming up with an application architecture is fairly say straight possibly because i have a couple of years experience as a developer so i have a pretty good understanding of this realm and there are also loads of examples and our organisation has a couple of applications that form 1 or more systems which we then install we thought it would make sense to create a system architecture and an enterprise architecture as and this is where the problems is no consistent guidance out if you search for architecture the stuff that you get back is so different that i am wondering if there is a way to do my understanding of it the system architecture is an abstraction of 1 or more application architectures depicting how they work together to form a an enterprise architecture is a further abstraction showing how your fit into a organisations enterprise and how it interacts with the business it strategy and how it integrats into other systems in the i have it completely there any standards out there where can i find there be or would a system architecture simply be any document in any format which is clearly and easily understandable and useful to its would the seasoned architects think of that approach want to simply list a set of soa related patterns that may be like to make it a little more focused to what we which is the build financial solutions on a service orientated what about does anyone have experience with it at all and is it worth the effort of trying to understand it in systems and application architecture

 am in a similar working on a web app that is targeted at it and required to support the same set of minus general things learned so in as many of your target browsers as you make sure you have time for this in your development can get you part of the way to but will eventually miss something on some plan some time for debugging and researching fixes for specific you need something not in a toolkit and find a free code invest some time to write utility functions that encapsulate the yourself about known browser so that you can steer your implementation around few things conditional code based on the only as a last because different generations of the browser may have different test for behavior first then common functions and if you look at the for a specific browser type version when the dom is for script access is different in just about every a good toolkit will abstract this for handlers are different in just about every a good toolkit will abstract this for dom particularly form controls or elements with can be tricky with and while not standard kinda using with strings that contain bits of html seems to be more reliable across browser i have yet to find a toolkit that will let you use to add a to a form element in differences are just as important as js javascript features array seem to be pretty reliable and consistent across especially relative to the some small joy in the fact that the language entirely different on every really run into any js but always one of the first browsers i

 am looking for a good way to keep a design document up to date with the latest are a small team game graphic project sales most of our projects last a couple of at the start of the project a design is made but we generally find ourselves making changes or new decisions throughout the most of these changes are so we want to keep our process like the changed design results in more time needed this is generally taken care so that part is at the moment we have no nice way of capturing the changes to the initial design document and this results in the initial design quickly being abandoned as a source while this is of course a waste of our documents are and the best way to track changes in those documents will probably be adding a changelist to the top of the document and making the changes in the text in parallel not really an option think as looked at requirements management but that looks way to the documents could be stored in subversion but i think that is a bit too low level to give insight in the anyone know a good way to track changes like these and keep the design document a valuable resource throughout the at the moment we mostly rely on changes to the original design being put in the that way they are at least related version control applicable in document changes to a design

 am trying to play fancy games which have the compiler synthesize hash values of constant strings at this would let me replace the string with a single with a massive savings in code size and programming clarity and be awesome if i could examine and compute at compiletime with simple inline character strings like which are compiletime constant pointers to compiletime constant i can index into these at i can make a template metaprogram to do what i but it is unclear if the standard treats a index of a array as by another const char quite valid but the value v a compile time already believe the answer is but in practice some compilers accept it without even any much less for the following compiles and runs without even a single warning from char void c const char the tricky and interesting compiler will not compile at giving a reasonably coherent error message about using a template with an object with internal suspect the answer to my question is you assume any array reference even to a constant array with a constant index is constant at does this mean the intel successful execution is a bug in the intel a compiletime constant index into a compiletime constant array itself compiletime

 am writing a linq provider to a hierarchal data i find it easiest to design my api by writing examples showing how i want to use and then coding to support those use thing i am having trouble with is an way to express or recursion in a linq in other what is the best way to distinguish item in where select item in where select please note neither of those examples above necessarily reflect the structure of the query i i am interested in good way to express i am not asking how to implement such a or how to write my iqueryable or ienumerable in such a way that allows i am asking from the standpoint of a person writing the linq query and utilizing my provider what is an intuitive way for them to express whether they want to recurse or data structure resembles a typical file a folder can contain a collection of and a folder can also contain a collection of so represents all the folders who are immediate children of and contains all the items immediately within a basic example of a site much like a filesystem with folders and i item in where select is the most intuitive way to express an intent that the query get all items underneath light or only the immediate the way to distinguish between the two goal is to be able to turn this linq provider over to other developers who have an average understanding of linq and allow them to write both recursive and list queries without giving them a tutorial on writing recursive given a usage that looks i can code the provider against am really sucking at communicating this linq provider is to an external it is not simply walking an object nor in this specific case does a recursive actually translate into any kind of true recursive activity under the just need a way to distinguish between a query and a what do you think is the best way to express or is there a standard way of expressing it that missed out recursion in

 an using the stl spits reams of incomprehensible and compiler reason for this is essentially if you use templates stl you will get of error so if you implement your own template based collection classes you will not be in any better could make non template based containers and store everything as void pointers or some base class but you would lose compile time type checks and sucks as a dynamic it is not as safe to do this as it would be in python or one of the reasons being that does not have a root class for all classes to all introspection on all objects and some basic error handling at instead your app would likely crash and burn if you were wrong about the type and you would not be given any clues to what went

 another way to look at assume you understand the concept of an array something that supports the operation of where you can get to the ith in one no matter how large a for if you want to store information about a group of people who all happen to have different a simple way would be to have an array that is large and use each age as an index into the thay you could have access to any of course there could be more than one person with the same so what you put in the array at each entry is a list of all the people who have that so you can get to an individual information in one step plus a little bit of search in that list a it only slows down if there are so many people that the buckets get then you need a larger and some other way to get more identifying information about the like the first few letters of their instead of using the basic instead of using any function of the person that produces a good spread of values can be the hash like you could take every third bit of the ascii representation of the scrambled in some all that matters is that you want too many people to hash to the same because the speed depends on the buckets remaining

 answer directly but as you are designing your database structures you might want to take at some of the the objects in the in particular look at the assignment and gradingassignment for how to store the you could use a rdbms or perhaps database if this is just a small personal project you could just serialize the data to something like csv or whatever and storing it as a it might be better in the long run to use a database a database format will probably scale a lot

 any graphics compression algorithm is going to do what you heavily optimized for compressing 2d arrays of numbers into the smallest possible to other thing to since looking to use compression to reduce processing is that getting really high compression ratios generally involves more calculation to compress and decompress the you may reach a point where spending more time compressing and decompressing the array than running the neural again to on your it sounds like what you may want is a use the curve to turn your array into a 1x2500 line and then come up with a formula that approximates the values you want for each cell of the the array have to be it may be much easier to fill with a space filling curve if a square of slightly different the hilbert curve works nicely for dimensions that are powers of for

 approach is a bad idea for a couple of but first some is an array of 0 which i even think is permitted for stack when declaring an array like this you must specify the maximum number of values you will ever is super if you do specify a number less and you use then you will cause a memory overwrite which at best crashes and at worst causes strange bugs that are a nightmare to track next problem is this i this line does is take the value stores in the address specified by and add what you want is to get the value at nth element of the address specified by like but you should take five minutes to think about a better way to do reasons i mentioned a bad idea need to iterate over the entire array anytime you require its can never store the terminating element this case in the i would suggest you maintain a separate value that stores the number of elements in the a very common way of doing this is to create a class that wraps this concept block of elements and the current standard library comes with a template class named which can be used for this not quite the same as an array must add items first before but very it also provides support for which is handy your program written to use instead of the function added something to print out the using namespace for i i cout cout return	
 approach is fine use that quite a long you control the it work with java clients if you know you will never need to support then it can be but it breaks some purist soa in an intranet scenario is one where i might consider this and the ide have options to types from existing assemblies to do exactly another advantage of this approach is if you want to use the same validation logic at the without coding it twice for example

 apps or tools do you use for data entry into your trying to improve our existing system that uses a php web based system for entering data one item at a current solution to this is to use a it works well with text and numbers that are human but not with foreign keys that are used to join with the other that i want a row of data to include what city someone lives the column holding this is which is keyed to the table which has two id and name envision being able to extend the spreadsheet capabilities to include dropdown for every row of the column that would allow the user to select which city the text of the city but actually storing the city id this the spreadsheet show a great deal of data on each screen and could be exported as a csv file and thrown to our existing scripts that manually insert rows into the have been playing around with ms excel and as well as but have not found something that gives me the functionality i mention items on my dynamically fetch the name of cities that can be selected by the allow the user to push the data directly into the backend via external if any of the columns of the rows of data gets changed in the the user could refresh the data on the screen to reflect any recent you know how i could improve the process of data what tools do you i use postgresql for the backend and have access to ms as well as web based i would love a solution that is and require much time to develop or deploy dream know that pgadmin3 has similar but from what i have it is more of an administrative tool rather than something for users to applications do you use for data entry and retrieval via	
 are a couple of other differences have any concrete abstract base classes this allows you to provide concrete implementations this can allow an abstract base class to actually provide a more rigorous wheras an interface really only describes how a class is abstract base class can have members defining the which gives more control to the base class than one interface can be implemented on a a class can only derive from a single abstract base this allows for polymorphic hierarchy using but not abstract base this also allows for a using base classes can be modified in without breaking the changes to interfaces are breaking unlike abstract base can be applied to value types structs cannot inherit from abstract base this allows behavioral guidelines to be applied on value	
 are a desktop software developer point of view to that of a web rich web application such as flash or look like better tools for doing wysiwyg text editors for the they are capable of more sophisticated data representation and they are consistent through the browsers and platforms maybe not silverlight and moonlight but at least flash seems to the developers prefer to go with with all their toiling diligently to work around every particular quirk and using numerous hacks to make these technologies do what they never originally supposed to be able to are some generally accepted arguments why you should not use flash for a as well as a generally accepted the embedded video how is a rich text editor flash control lives in isolated does a wysiwyg text of a flash control be indexed by the search who cares about indexing the ever changing unsaved content of an all users may have flash so not all of them may have javascript here the question what are the advantages of choosing javascript over flash for implementing a wysiwyg what would be the disadvantages of choosing there are no wysiwyg rich text editors in

 are so many possible answers but take a crack at issues should an application designer take into consideration when devising the error and exception handling you have multiple it should be easy to your error handling otherwise people use transactions wisely to maintain data i see apps all the time where a failure could occur halfway through a process and cause wierd data inconsistencies because the entire operation was not rolled back criticality when you handle for if you have an online ordering system and part of that workflow is to have an sent to the site owner letting them know that a new order was if sending that were to should the user get an error and the whole order be the strategy will differ depending on the software type business hosted web embedded is the software type desktop type or embedded recording information about the environment other apps can be very useful when investigating error enterprise apps and web things like error sms messaging and integration with eco tools become very political and legal only thing i can think of here would be for desktop apps type applications are generally frowned especially if they submit information about the users machine that could be perspectives on error handling business a user try to avoid errors by designing the interface in such a way that it is difficult for them to make ask questions that the user probably be able to answer fail a developer want as much information as possible to help diagnose what happened stack environment a business support management want to know what to do about the error in an enterprise who is responsible for the application do i as well as the criticality and any possible side effects if this batch job what business processes will that written documentation is your friend

 are usually run with a resource limit ulimit on the stack but not on the heap malloc will manage the memory increase of its heap area from the operating and the operating system will arrange for this page to somehow get allocated physically and correspond to your heap for your if there is no more ram in your computer then most operating systems has something like a swap partition on when your system starts to need to use swap then things gradually get if one process leads to it may easily be identified with some utility like ps your code is to run with a resource limit or on a system with a poor size of memory and no i think one may program with the assumption that malloc if not just make a dummy wrapper that may someday do the check and simply an return value does not make as your program requires the memory it already has if your malloc fails and you check for your process will die anyway when it starts accessing the pointer it with malloc does in most cases not arise from but from a logical error in your program that leads to misbehaved calls to malloc and this usual problem will not get detected by checking malloc

 assignment operator is not required to be made discussion below is about but it also applies to any operator overloading that takes in the type in and any function that takes in the type in below discussion shows that the virtual keyword does not know about a inheritance in regards to finding a matching function in the final example it shows how to properly handle assignment when dealing with inherited functions know about signature needs to be the same for virtual to come into so even know in the following is made the call will never act as a virtual function in d because the parameters and return value of are function and are completely different and seen as 2 distinct virtual x return int d public virtual x y return int values and having 2 overloaded can though define a virtual function to allow you to set default values for d when it is assigned to variable of type this is even if your b variable is really a d stored into a reference of a you will not get the the below an assignment from 2 d objects stored inside 2 b the override is same b as d public virtual x y return virtual x return int char d b d b b2 return 99 99 shows that is never the virtual keyword on you would have the same results as above but the value of y would not be it would use the last step to tie it all can use rtti to properly handle virtual functions that take in your here is the last piece of the puzzle to figure out how to properly handle assignment when dealing with possibly inherited virtual const d x y x y return

 basicly seen 2 types of async you give a call a callback which should be performed after the in such way works gio of previously mentioned it is relativly easy to program with it but you usually have the thread in which the callback will be run changed if it is intergrated with main loop as in case of you check if the data is in such manner bsd sockets it has an advantage of not necessary being integrated with main loop and running callback in specific you program for gnome or like to add that seems to be a very nice i used will have better support for async

 been reading up on linq lately to start implementing and a particular thing as to how it generates update queries that bothers the entities code automatically using sqlmetal or the object relational apparently all fields for all tables will get attribute which means that for every update and delete get sql statement like table set a where and and ad call me a but this seems extremely inefficient to and it feels like a bad idea even if it i know the fetch will be done by the clustered primary so not but sql still needs to check every field after that to make sure it in some very sensitive applications something like this can be but for the typical web app stack it seems like would be a more appropriate and personally prefer since linq will only update the actual fields that not all and in most real the second person editing something wins does mean that if two people manage to edit the same field of the same row in the small time between reading that row and firing the then the conflict that would be found be but in reality a very rare the one thing we may want to guard against when two people change the same thing be caught by because they click submit at the exact same time so there will be no conflict at the time the second datacontext reads and updates the record the datacontext is left open and stored in session when the page is or some other seriously bad idea like as rare as the case really like to not be getting exceptions in my code every now and then if this my first question am i wrong in believing for web not for banking i missing some reason why having as default is a sane second question can i change this is there a way to tell sqlmetal or the ord which updatecheck attribute to trying to avoid the situation where i have to remember to run a tool have to make take some regexes and edit all the attributes in the file because evident that at some point run sqlmetal after an update to the we run this and all our code will break in very subtle ways that we probably find while testing in stories are more than love to learn from other experiences on you very conflict setting updatecheck

 been teaching a class on unit refactoring and so and this is probably the thing that most people get refactoring is just changing the it is changing the code without changing the external functional that is a very important other you need to have some way to verify that the external functional behavior is intact after the lacking divine insight i find unit tests very useful for in his book on martin fowler stresses the use of automated tests for this your code was developed using tdd you will have the necessary test suite as it is developed during the development of the code if you need to refactor code for which no tests are your best approach would be to set up automated tests before you make any changes to the i realize that setting up tests for existing code can be but you will learn a lot about the code while doing may also want to check essay on strong typing versus strong as it discusses the feedback you get from the compiler versus the feedback you get from your test

 came back to this after a few days busy with other and figured it out right sorry i post the code but it was hard coming up with minimal example that displayed the root problem was that i left out the return statements in the recursive i lots of code it should have lots of code return worked through the magic of the right value happened to be in the right register at the right and made it to the right bug was originally introduced when i broke the first call into its own at that the extra nops were the difference between this first case being inlined directly into the general recursive for reasons that i fully inlining this first case led to the right value not being in the right place at the right and the function returning	
 came up works in all cases except against the empty i thought it would work because the last star matches the previous token or more if a much better way of doing this please let me know and explain it in solution must be a regex as the place where it will be used is a hook which requires a has to match a string without quotes as as zero is an even to match a string with an even number of	
 cameras produce a jpeg or mpeg4 or that you can my cameras do not let you download unlike earwicker they send images by or write them to an sd use the software on my synology rackstation to record streams on the i have not really looked at the software that they but i am almost certain behind the it is some linux software that is freely you could look into

 can actually reproduce the behaviour of const in you just have to do it the only way the caller can modify its state is by calling methods on it or setting is of type public void public string get set in your happy for them to get the but not set and definitely not happy about them calling that define an interface describing what allowed to public string get left out the mutating method and only left in the getter on the add that interface to the base list of in your class with the you have a fooclass a property ifooconst get return basically reproduces by hand precisely what the keyword would do in a reference of type foo is like an automatically generated type that only includes those members of that were marked as translating this into some theoretical future version of declare like public void public string get const set all done is merged the information in back into by tagging the one safe member with a new so in a adding a const keyword add much to the language besides a formal approach to this if you had a reference to a fooclass f would only be able to call the const members on that if the definition is the caller could cast an into a but they can do that in too called away and involves a special operator called t also the issue of interfaces not being very easy to evolve between versions of your if a third party may implement an interface you define they are free to do if they can see then you add new methods to it in future versions without requiring others to recompile their but only a problem if you are writing an extensible library for others to build maybe a feature would solve this	
 can add a makefile project to solution a which would build your solutions b and c msbuild for and make all the projects in a dependent on that makefile this way you be able to add project references to projects in b and but you can use dll references and they will always be built from latest

 can also create a which will store the that you want added to your files are copied to the and any directory in that file will be added to your pythonpath at question accepted	
 can also do this using dom level 2 css all but which uses its own is a theoretical advantage in this compared to the in that you have to worry about putting special html characters in the but in practice style elements are cdata in legacy and and are rarely used in stylesheets do need a stylesheet in place before you can started appending to it like that can be any existing active embedded or it if there the only standard way to create it at the moment is with	
 can also just use a create a delegate for the method that does the then call begininvoke on the passing it the and a callback function to handle the return values you after the begininvoke you can wait a designated time for the asynch delegate to and if it does not in that specified move public delegate list callerservicedelegate callsvcdel datetime cutoffdate iasyncresult ar put while if returntype returnvalue whatever else you need to do to handle whatever you need to do to handle as written asynchcallback could be as the code retrieves the return value from the but if you want to you can have the method call the asynchcallback delegate and pass it the return values	
 can also mean that you can tolerate some hiccups every once in a is the reliability my experience with more operating systems like linux in embedded is that they tend to experience random hiccups due to their smart optimizations that try to avoid starvation and similar for individual

 can answer that question since i wrote that dictionary an enumerator on the dictionary will get a reference to the internal kvp you would have to hold the read lock until you are done which could be a long reason i say to enumerate the keys or values is that i the list of keys and values when it is therefore i am not returning a reference to the dictionaries internal which if you altered out of could cause i suppose you could implement the same pattern on the as well if you wanted since they are read public virtual using return new public virtual using return new	
 can append the current information being received to the file it will be a performance but will allow you to get back to the last item being the application starts detect if there is a pending and provide the option to load the data saved in the file you have all the when you are doing the process that happens when make sure to record any significant changes in the process if you are hitting external record when you are initiating the operation and when it comes back right in the above there is always a window of time when it can but you want to keep it as short as possible and to have enough information for the recovery worst case if the system automatically you want it to have enough information to determine where in the process it

 can be but i would use ajax to make the experience you would call your method and it would return the identifier for the it have to be the thread but you need some sort of unique identifier that can be passed between you return from that you would execute your when your client checks on the it would check the or some other shared which would have the result keyed on the id you returned it finds a value corresponding to the then it displays the result removes the result from the shared it checks again in a specified period of	
 can be checked if it is thats all i	
 can be combinations of or white really think a regex is what you want not always the order of the data might vary between descriptions sometimes style comes before sometimes then a very good indicator that you want more general parsing using multiple regexes as suggested by you know the order is then you can probably construct a single regex to do but i think it would be more effort than there are probably better options it would help to know what language	
 can be done a lot of different depending on what you are trying to optimize memory pattern ddd 1 like similar to generate a random number between 0 and number of possibilities convert number to ddd random random query db for existence of id and increment until a free one is 2 feedback shift see seed with a random number in range below why you seed with generate subsequent random numbers by applying the following to the current id num skip ids larger than range convert number into id format will need to save the last number generated that was used for an but you need to query the db to see if it is this solution will enumerate all possible ids except due to the way the lfsr since your range is actually larger than you you can get back by subtracting 1 before you convert to the id and have your valid range be

 can be super beneficial on even a single core machine is parallel disk io is a pretty large factor in the build spawning two compiler instances per cpu core can actually increase as one compiler instance blocks on io the other one can usually jump into the cpu intensive part of need to make sure got the ram to support this be a problem on a modern otherwise end up swapping and that defeats the gnu make you can just use where is the number of simultaneous processes to make sure you have your dependency tree right before trying it though or the results can be tool really useful the parallel make is it works a treat with gcc you can use gcc or something with a similar command line distcc actually breaks up the compile task by pretending to be the compiler and spawning tasks on remote you call it in the same way as call and you take advantage of option to call many distcc one of my previous jobs we had a fairly intensive linux operating system build that was performed almost daily for a adding in a couple of dedicated build machines and putting distcc on a few workstations to accept compile jobs allowed us to bring build times down from a half a day to under 60 minutes for a complete os userspace a lot of other tools to speed compiles you might want to investigate more than creating ram something which looks like it will have very little gain since the os is doing disk caching with os designers spend a lot of time getting caching right for most they are smarter than you so i like to try and do better than you chew up ram for ram disk the os has less working ram to cache data and to run your code end up with more swapping and worse disk performance than otherwise you should profile this option before completely discarding

 can store values smaller than 8 or 32 you just need to pack them into a struct and use unsigned int a can be 0 through bool b the stores 0 or unsigned int c can be 0 through unsigned int d can be 0 through most your compiler will round up the total size of your structure to 32 bits on a 32 bit the other problem like you pointed that your values may not have a power of two this will make for wasted if you read the entire struct as one you will find values that will be impossible to if your input ranges all powers of feature you may find interesting is a they work like a but share so if you write to one field it overwrites the if you are really tight for and you want to push each bit to the there is a simple encoding say you want to store 3 each can be from 0 to bit fields are because if you use 3 bits waste some values you could never set 6 or even though you have room to store lets do an are three example each can be from 0 to int one two three pack them together most we should think in base 6 each value is from so packed into the smallest possible space packs all the values into one from 0 could be any value from 0 there are no pack one 6 how it looks like encoding in base each number is multiplied by place like where n is the place at to int one pack int two pack int three schemes are extremely handy when you have to encode some fields in a bar code or in an alpha numeric sequence for human just saying those few partial bits can make a the fields all have to have the same if one field is from 0 through use 8 instead of 6 in the proper there is no requirement that all fields have the same

 classic break on double recursion is to use a state variable to determine if you are already inside a my sub a return if nothing if or someone calls can do whatever you want if is but or returning is if you are using perl or later you can use the function instead of nesting the function in its own a state return if nothing if or someone calls	
 classic example that joel spolsky uses is on of strcat and and spotting the algorithms in not that you need c to solve problems that languages that knowing c well gives you a perspective on going on underneath all those levels of languages that allows you to write better because just such a perspective helps you avoid writing code which unknown to actually for some clarification based on c is not a prerequisite for such there are many ways to acquire the same c is also not a guarantee of these you may be proficient in c and yet still write kludgy code in every other language you is a yet it still has modern control structures and functions so you always getting caught up in the fiddly very difficult to become proficient at c without gaining a mastery of certain fundamentals as the details of memory management and mastery of which often pays rich dividends when working in any always about the is true in many pursuits as well as software it is not secret incantations that make the best programmers the rather it is a greater mastery of the experience has shown that knowledge of c tends to have a higher correlation to mastery of certain of those and that learning c tends to be one of the easier and more common routes to acquiring such

 constructor is a defined method on a type which takes a specified number of parameters and is used to create and initialize an object initializer is code that runs on an object after a constructor and can be used to succinctly set any number of fields on the object to specified the setting of these fields occurs the constructor is would use a constructor without the help of an object initializer if the constructor sufficiently set the initial state of the an object initializer however must be used in conjunction with a the syntax requires the explicit or implicit use and of a constructor to create the initial you would use an object initializer when the constructor does not sufficiently initialize the object to your use and a few simple field property sets	
 constructor is a method accepting parameters and returning a new instance of a it may contain initialization you can see an example of a class private someclass public s new consider the following class public someclass s public could achieve the same result as in the first example using an object assuming that you can access with the following s new you can an object initializer allows you to specify values for public fields and public properties at the same time construction is and especially useful when the constructor supply any overload initializing certain however that object initializers are just syntactic sugar and that after compilation really differ from a sequence of

 correct and i was stuck with the bloated vhd to but somehow managed to screw that up and lost the is what else i is a great article explaining why differentials are so apparently each byte is written into its own 512 byte sector waisting tons of presentation explains how to use disk compression when storing differencing disks and that undo disks utilize less in placing you differencing vhd or vud into a ntfs compressed folder will save you tons of created a differencing disk for the wssv3 image from microsoft booted it up and installed just the boot processed added 300mb to the installing tortoisesvn added and installing wspbuilderextensions added 1gb to the end result was differential from installing i merged it with the base and resulted in only adding 29mb back to the then created another differential vhd inside a ntfs compressed started it up and created a new wss web application through central the file size jumped up to but only resulted in 90mb on the file system do to the ntfs i then created a renamed to vhd and completed the same the file size increased to 300mb which resulted in 12mb on the file the differential vhd is highly ineffective and has no intelligence it in what so but the bloating allows for some nice development you should also create a new attach it as a secondary drive and move your file here since any and every file io is captured in the differencing or undo

 creating a website and i want to have people using the site can do things like vote and flag questionable is the only way to identify and prevent users from doing this repeatedly by using realize a user can just clear their cookies but i think of another for this a website with no are cookies the only way to prevent people from repeating	
 creating a website my pattern often is the infrastructure talk to domain services or infrastructure and domain services may talk to infrastructure services will wrap things like smtp i handle identity as an infrastructure if an infrastructure service or domain service needs to find out the invoker it will request an identity service at the identity service will have methods properties to identity the this way i have for a that determines the identity by session cookie a little stuck about how to handle results of service for i may have a service that has a method that simply takes a string comment and an identifier for the target application service calls this service perhaps like actionresult string commenttext this method may fail if the current identity or pass policy that the articleservice checks as being able to comment every 30 seconds throwing and catching exceptions from service calls like this seems very because my calling code has no way of checking if it can actually invoke this action successfully fatal app initially i started to make the services return a the result would be uniquely identifiable so the caller would know if the comment was indeed made additionally i would return the comment entity in the the results would also identify things like not post as user is not or not post as specified period has not been actually return strings but you get the reasoning behind this is that the application service be in control of if an action should imagine say i moved all of the user identity checks and everything out of the domain service and into the application have tons of replicated as well as giving the application services completely power over what can guess my question is given that infrastructure services will enforce additionally what is the best way to inform the calling code the action did or and in should secondary data as authorization be handled in an

 currently a software engineering familiarity with the following list of things helped me get an interview and an offer right out of these are just markup and chances are barely be glanced at if you put them on a flash so and java are more but you might want to look into the following additional to really spice up that comfortable with oo principles abstract vs concrete is a great beginner programming primarily a developer so i tend to favor but i started with java in my college days and picked up on it very and lambda anonymous you can start with the express edition of visual but may eventually want to get the full on to higher level programming concepts such as design patterns the list goes on and recommend the gang of four book will tell you which book it management be comfortable using group by and having and familiarize yourself with aggregate db design concepts modeling with the free like mysql or on microsoft sql server or oracle are the big deeper with things like normal data warehousing look into unit testing and quality assurance defect prevention goes along with some of the points mentioned into methodologies like and xp perhaps even psp and to use control systems such as and vss unfortunately not free the first two could get really crazy and learn about static code but definitely look into code reviews and code i thought give you some books to check out particular to 2nd charles ronald strategies for complex 5th george first book of visual gary introduction to with 3rd thomas structures for 5th judith the requirements suzanne robertson databases 5th quality quality jeff a 2nd and peter architecture in len and rick testing in how the 1st link and peter 1st worsley and joshua a process 1st introduction to the 1st guess all i have for if you can get these things your skill set should be pretty and be on your way towards being another member of the software engineering not sure that anything you do on your own will give you the same level of knowledge as college but sure this is a good this is a hefty be surprised if obtaining these skills takes a couple of far as your graphic design depending on the type of job you find yourself they may be more important than your programming on top of either skill make sure your soft skills are polished and that you are confident in your

 defining datatypes in a i have always had a problem with choosing whether to use integers or strings to store certain i am building and there is a post code provided that post codes are a 4 digit which data type do i store it integer or technically it is an but not doing any sort of calculations on just spitting it out into a would your opinion change if i want to sort the table by post not i do recognize a valid need for such as page views and unique users or logged in users and guest but what about for storing how many files are in a integer or vs string in	
 definitely a serious recently made a dsl to model orderprocesses for a we use a windowsservice that that connects to different webservices based on which processtatus a specific row has and then changes the status based on the outcome it was very timeconsuming to edit that so i made a language and generators for sql must check if allowed to post any code from the project but i post the db structure so you can understand why hard do edit that i have to put in data for 10 orderprocesses with steps each with actions and everything is a refrence to a table not not not constraint primary key clustered

 demonstarting is a code smell called create a custom type and return that from your repository try to be overly just end up pushing that complexity into your business code because be interacting with your entities using purely procedural better to create objects that model your concerned with too much data access look in to using an orm framework to take care of generating this for you let this concern dictate bad design in your application	
 depends a lot on how going to use the existing if grabbing the source and modifying it to do new got a bigger problem than if just reusing existing libraries or you are taking code and changing you need permission from the original copyright holders to distribute your changes to their code under the gplv3 which you can either try to get explicitly them an or maybe already have apache license for gpl if the code was gpled with the your any later or under a bsd you should be fine just reusing existing programs as often fine anyway though when you redistribute something under gplv2 or gplv3 often be required to distribute everything people need to actually use the as well as the code the more the other software is throw out the gplv2 stuff and put in some other implementation from someone else the better off you are on that

 depends on how implemented your my company uses business objects similar to csla objects and make extensive use of inotifypropertychanged throughout the business validation engine relies heavily on being notified that properties change through this mechanism and it works very if you are using a different implementation other than business objects where notification of changes as critical to the you may have other methods for detecting change in your business also have view models that propagate the changes from the model where but the view models themselves are listening to the underlying model	
 depends on how your message is sent and how you call if the target window is owned by the current the call bypasses the message queue for the window and the window manager directly calls the windowproc on the target if the target window is owned by another the window manager effectively calls postmessage and pumps window messages until the target window returns from the window you call the window manager marshals the message parameters and inserts the corresponding object onto the message queue for the target when it next calls getmessage the message is removed from the message window manager also registers for raw input events from the input devices and it generates messages for those input it then inserts those messages in the queue as appropriate processing of input events is complicated because it depends on what messages are already in the message queue for the stefan translatemessage just translates accelerator keys for instance it converts key sequences to

 depends on the and on the union char int i remember it depends on the alignment that the compiler puts into the allocated unless you use some special the compiler will put padding into your union with gcc you need to use a pragma union char int can also see it from the disassemble some for 0x00001fd2 push 0x00001fd2 push 0x00001fd3 mov 0x00001fd3 mov 0x00001fd5 push 0x00001fd5 push 0x00001fd6 sub 0x00001fd6 sub 0x00001fd9 call 0x1fde 0x00001fd9 call 0x1fde 0x00001fde pop 0x00001fde pop 0x00001fdf movl 0x00001fdf movl 0x00001fe7 lea 0x00001fe7 lea 0x00001fed mov 0x00001fed mov 0x00001ff0 call 0x3005 0x00001ff0 call 0x3005 0x00001ff5 add 0x00001ff5 add 0x00001ff8 pop 0x00001ff8 pop 0x00001ff9 leave 0x00001ff9 0x00001ffa ret 0x00001ffa the only difference is in where the compiler allocates on the stack 0xd instead of	
 depends on the complexity of what you want to as mentioned by almost every is just great for server side web simple stuff is simple the complex is handled reasonably php syntax is c logically consistant you will hardly ever need to refer to the syntax section of the excellent php just serves up you will need to learn css and probably some to put in those personally made the mistake of thinking javascript was just another basic scripting language and missed out on the elegance that javascript can bring for several almost all the interactive good stuff you see in sites like gmail and stackoverflow is down to almost all the visual presentation on these sites is down to extremly complex back end stuff if you need to keep state between you may be better off with java and assorted frameworks or plus spring with freemarker and ibatis is my personal winning problem here is there is a steep learning curve to this and you only want to go there if you really need the power of a java back

 did some benchmarks in an article about peter zaitsev done a simple benchmark to see performance of query row point standard prepared and have it served from query prepared statements give which is better than 2000 with statements but it is still well 4470 when results served from query seems to say that the of using prepared statements is that they are than using a straight query at least in this simple the relative difference probably diminishes with a more complex query or a larger result seems that prepared queries would be given the double to the server and other benchmark lacks you should run your own because the type of query you and your environment and are definitely important for query it was true in the past that prepared statements were incompatible with caching query but this was see the query cache in the mysql mysql statements do not use the query beginning with statements use the query cache certain which depending on the preparation documentation goes on to describe these go read do recommend using prepared statements for quoting variables as you interpolate them into sql statements can be effective if you do it but even quoting may have some subtle security with character sets mysql bug easier to use prepared queries in a secure way in these

 drawing offscreen to a created using then later generating a from it with and drawing that onto my view in also drawing some other stuff on top of that this is an exercise in isolating different levels of variability and all works fine when all running on the main however one of the motivations for splitting this out this way was so that the offscreen part could be run on a background thread i had thought should be ok since not rendering to an onscreen when i do this the resulting image is checked over the and placed judicious to verify that everything is happening in the right next step is to boil this down to the simplest code that reproduces the issue find some silly thing missing and fix at which point have some code to post here if but i first wanted to check here that not going down the wrong path with i find anything in my travels around the googlesphere that sheds light either way but a friend did mention that he ran into a similar issue while trying to resize images in a background thread suggesting there may be some general limitation for the responses so if nothing else they have told me that at least not alone in not having an answer for this which was part of what i wanted to find at this point going to put the extra work into getting the simplest possible example and may come back with some code or more in the meantime keep any ideas coming point to bring a couple of people have used the term with respect to it should be noted that there are two types of thread safety in this of the api itself ie can it be used at all from more than one thread state and other issues such as strtok are common reasons that an api might not be thread safe of individual operations can multiple threads interact with the same objects and resources through api without application level suspect that mention so far has been of the first but would appreciate if you could i got it all executive summary is that the problem was with rather than bitmap contexts my background just before i drew into the bitmap i was doing some preparation on some other it turns out the calls to those other objects where leading to setneedsdisplay being called on some separating the part that did that out to the main thread it now all works for anyone who hits this question wondering if they can draw to a bitmap context on a background the answer is you can the caveats that have been presented here and in the core can you draw to a bitmap context from a background

 dynamic sql can be more efficient for the some of the comments here seem to endorse my view that dynamic sql can be confusing to the human especially when they write the code of the person who will inherit your prefer static sql in a and make the call to the proc dynamic at runtime by choosing appropriate if you use sql ddl to define the proc you can specify values for the parameters so the caller can simply omit the ones that are not needed see if you can follow the logic in this procedure integer integer integer from db where col1 is and col2 is and col3 is it may not yield the best execution plan but imo you have to balance optimization against good design principles it runs really quick on my machine

 each of these platforms change frequently and impose unique and sometimes complex not aware of any documents that discuss limitations of individual and such documents could become rapidly become outdated best way to come to understand what limitations to expect might be to build an understanding of the security issues for myspace does not allow widgets to run javascript because it would run in the context of the secure myspace blogger allows javascript because each blog is on a subdomain and javascript is not able to access the root facebook allows a custom version of javascript that is carefully sanitized to prevent applications from hijacking the quickest way to get an idea of what can be done would probably be to just try out the widgets on each of these

 experienced to work with the code which was but still of low actually reviewer looked through the code and could think that this is more formal procedure and pay enough attention to the process of review and have reviewed the some small fixes can be made but significant flaws are problem is to explain that it is important to make the thorough because in future this code is easier to easy to reassign to other person all these reasons are not essential for responsible for code is another author of code can leave reviewer think about company spend more time to fix bugs when they reproduced by it mater for some things are not author explain this to the and reviewer even can support effectively such to make reviewer interested in high quality code

 feminella got it but i think there is more to entropy is based on and probability is always in the eye of the said that 1 and 0 were equally likely if that is then the string of 100 1s followed by 100 0s has a probability of of which is 200 as you the entropy of that string shannon is its information content times its or 200 still a really small is important because if you do coding to compress the in the case of this string it will get a small but averaged over all it will not do with it will average out to about but not the other if you look at your original string and say it is so striking that whoever generated it is likely to generate more like then you are really saying its probability is larger than so you are making a different assumptions about the original probability structure of the generator of the namely that it has lower entropy than 200 i find this subject really especially when you look into kolmogorov in that you define the information content of a string as the length of the smallest program that could generate this leads to all sorts of insights into software engineering and language hope that and thanks for your	
 few books and articles ever go into detail about why multiple methods are provided to complete a specific task in a specific scenario and what considerations a developer should take when choosing between specific case in point is the simple opening of a text file first section of any io most just say how to open a text streamreader with file tada and end of do at least list the fact that there are multiple classes that allow you to do this discuss that there are even more overloads so you can use each class in several different fewer even try to enter into any discussion about how to select the best method for the task at of course do and these are the ones that usually end up in the top three when someone posts a question about lack of discussion drives me i feel like i should toss a question has the joint purposes out if anyone thinks this is a worthwhile topic in the first people an opportunity to list any interesting articles or books that specifically go into these kinds of made this a wiki because other similar questions were made into and if people feel this question has no i apologize and feel free to vote it am currently reading about binarywriter and the last 20 articles i have hit using google and at least 5 books on safari have shown me how to write a single integer and read it a couple included an example of how to use writestring and exactly one let me know that and use a special encdoding meaning if you do and you get a there are lots of ways to use these why do hardly any articles discuss example of what i mean is when a book or article lists class members and descriptions word for word from msdn without adding any i do not need a list of class members because i can get that from from an i need real world knowledge stuff that will expand me as a not stuff i can look up in five all the member lists and simple examples in the world going to really help anyone who wants to learn their one i reading about stringwriter and same lots of articles and books giving simple some at least say something vague like i may want to use stringwriter if i want to write characters to an underlying how would i know if i want to do what real world scenarios would require i could go on all so i has answers from merhdad and jalf that both explain how you would choose between two methods of generating a random number and demonstrates the kind of information i am talking jalf something along the lines of most cases use option but in this specific case when you are trying to achieve result use option and by the this will have negative effect vs y figured out i can get what i want by searching for x vs y articles based class library many ways to do a specific task what are the top x vs y articles and

 few points to consider with multiple tables be necessary to lookup information in all the if yes you will need to search in all tables which is not such simple to the schema changes it is not simple to update the database as all the tables representing the same type of entity would need to information about user edits is also not very simple as it is split in multiple edits consider the scenario documents did the user you considered alternative approaches to storing it is necessary to store each excel row in database as a table storing data as xml and only save idexes on or maybe store only tracking modifications and the document the application can take a part of the database burden and do the

 file replication is we have a web application across 8 different iis due to the nature of the minor changes to files and controls happen frequently throughout the and after being tested and published to are replicated out to each of the public webservers through xcopy deployment on a scheduled basis every 10 course this is incredibly as each server must have a redundant copy of the entire and we would like to eliminate the publishing hosting from shared now have the option to use centralized storage with an iscsi interface to host the entire site with each server believing that the remote storage is a local publishes would be instantaneous and hosting the drive off a unc share is not as there are so many different directories in the site each requiring a filesystemwatcher for to monitor for that the smb maximum command count is quickly we know about the maxcmds and maxmpxct registry changes trigger massive problem we forsee is that certain changes to the file system structure can cause nearly every compiled or to have to causing queued requests and a perception that the server is most resources are not used and so recompiling them on a change causes hardly a blip in a global master page used by all pages on the site can cause but this can easily be managed by primary culprit is the changes to the file cause the entire web application to and recompilations to we currently replicate any changes requires bringing the web server off the load applying the and then warming the server up with junk requests before it is placed back on the load if the like the rest of the web directory is located on centralized there is only one copy of the and individual servers could not be patched and warmed up there a way to get an web application to take its marching orders from a source other than a file named there would be one file per for is the name defined is there a registry setting that could be set on a is there an entry that could be made in the or the global to specify what file to out of so i am i am not asking how to have different appsettings for and there are other topics that cover and all my will be identical most of the the only time i need them to be different is when an update is being using the for any appsettings this is for the really important like assembly httphandler and other settings that can not be tried searching the registry for and found nothing except for applications that noted that i had recently edited which i apparently do a no help in website hosted from shared

 find out what the primary key is your table is as when 0 then 1 else 0 as as as sysindexes join sysobjects so on 0 255 will give you something isclust keycnt 1 2 you have your primary key name whether clustered or number of fields in it and index id need it run the will give you the names of two fields from the first parameter is your table second is index id obtained earlier and the third one loops from 1 to keycnt on the previous this information you should be able to reconstruct the primary key as table add constraint primary key clustered this might not be as accurate as parsing result mentioned will miss the sort order and but easier

 finding it very hard to read your regex with all the if interpreting this dialect of regex what saying is what verbose pcre would obvious problem that jumps out is that it starts with a lookbehind lookbehind is troublesome enough as it is not supported in many regex but then compounded by being followed by a liberal match character with negative is for a processor to the combination pretty much kills any possible optimisation it might have been able to for every character in the file it has to backtrack to the beginning of of previous to see if the lookbehind then step forward to the end of looking for could help it by using only a or simply forgetting about the lookarounds and including the whole string in the which will be more efficient to at the expense of needing a bit more to pick out the groups interested as always with this kind of clippy looks like parsing xml with you like use a real xml parser because regex is inherently incapable of parsing just soldier on making unreadable complex regexes which still show me this tip

 frequently frustrated by the amount of logging i have to include in my code and it leads me to wonder if a better way of doing know if this has been done or if someone has come up with a better idea but i was wondering is there a way anyone knows of to a logger into an application such that it passively monitors the thread and quietly logs processes as they occur without having to do things void string object process myprocess with int d returned value catch exception occurred during process would be great is if i could say to my would then monitor everything that goes on inside of that method including passed in arguments along with method calls and values passed into those exceptions that occur anyone implemented something like this in the could it even is logging in this fashion just a pipe love to design something that would do but i just even know where of i want to reinvent the wheel if already been it would be great if someone could point me in the right suggestions would be gratefully i thought comment on an answer which queried as to the level of detail required in the it is frequently required that configurable levels of logging be provided such that if the configuration specifies detailed logging then everything is whereas if critical logging is configured then only certain information is logged along with if fatal logging is configured then only information which causes the application to die would be would something like this be configurable or would aop require 3 or 4 different builds depending on the number of logging frequently use 4 passive logging possible in

 george said working effectively with legacy code is the bible for this kind of the only way others in your team will buy in is if they see the benefit to them personally of keeping the tests achieve this you require a test framework with which is as easy as possible to plan for other developers you take your tests as examples to write their if they do not have unit testing expect them to spend time learning a they will probably see writing unit testings as slowing their development so not knowing the framework is an excuse to skip the some time on continuous integration using cruise cdash if your code is automatically compiled every night and tests run then developers will start to see the benefits if unit tests catch bugs before thing to encourage is shared code if a developer changes their code and breaks someone test they should not expect that person to fix their they should investigate why the test is not working and fix it in my experience this is one of the hardest things to developers write some form of unit some times a small piece of code they check in or integrate the make integrating these into the build easy and developers will start to buy approach is to add tests for new and as code is sometimes you cannot add as many or as detailed tests as you would like without decoupling too much existing err on the side of the only place i insist on unit tests is on platform specific where are replaces with platform specific higher level these must be tested on all platforms with the same this saves loads of time adding new use to structure our the simple self registering functions make writing tests are wrapped in ctest of this runs a group of unit tests executables at once and generates a simple nightly build is automated with ant and luntbuild glues and java i hope to add automated deployment and functional tests to the

 guess a variant of the my kids to language little context is in at my father is going to retire pretty soon soon enough that i need to start caring about that he is a very active person and looking for occupations for his future free and one of these could be while he is a history he is more than capable of as he was a early adopter of personal computing back when programming a computer was part of its normal on the apple he programmed in basic little programs while entertaining for me i was could not really be called and later on he taught me programming on this same apple i was only obviously my own starting applesoft which is also what he already is no longer relevant in this day and and not going to start by teaching him what working c too while not strictly speaking a better he restarts programming using one of these newfangled languages i keep hearing about thing i know none of so i thought ask what is the best language for that going to teach myself that then teach it to so the availability of online teaching while is not a it would be best for the language to make have as few strange idiosyncrasies or historical arctifacts as it should be obvious as much as i would start with then move to gui someone who has programmed line basic on an apple does not need a fancy popularity of the besides being is not a big available to platform functionality would be good error diagnostics and debugging is a while leisure is the main this would be put to use for specialised light at least at the the and of a new language is something that will be interesting for me to learn as since be investing time in though more of a side these are mostly soft i do have one hard and fast it needs to run on mac os this is what would you right now leaning towards in thank you all for your now going to install and try out the two winning python and java as well as a smalltalk after having investigated i will make my choice go ahead on the project with that add a bounty to this question amount of which will depend on my reputation at that and instanty accept the answer which proposed that choice can obviously not put the bounty as take me more than a week to unless the choice is smalltalk with in which case put an answer for it and accept it a wise you cannot add an answer for smalltalk with squeak and hope to get the since have put this answer after i decided to invest my time in the least i can not a problem that i have a single definitive choice from this i had intended to try out a few languages before making a choice and this question was very useful in coming up with a in all answers were useful in helping me clarify criterion and making me think about the so thank you all programming language to teach my

 guess would be that does not retain the and when filling the table view you add references to the strings in that your property should look is not a problem in the first example because the strings are literal they are embedded in your program and are never second example creates a temporary and although its reference is incremented when added to the array it will later deallocated and destroyed when the array is this going to result in a memory you are allocating a new then changing the value in the pointer to be the result of the stringwithformat if you wish fieldname to persist then the correct code would

 guessing you know you can bind a variable to to remove that piece of dynamic unfortunately for your clause and you bind a variable for a list in oracle least up to as far as i do have a few your current solution is the another solution is to change the procedure to accept multiple variables and create a list of and from c where and and and have a fixed list of in values from c where and not in have to be careful in the case where you only want 2 the third will have to be set to some value not in be careful and test null values solution is presented in this looks quite though i tested it works by creating a function which allows you to pass a series of numbers separated by commas and creating a via dual to do a or replace type mytabletype as table of or replace function in varchar2 return long default mytabletype exit when end return example would look something from c where and not in select from inlist select as mytabletype from dual would only work if was a list of have to change str2tbl to handle quotes if they are included in the variable you cant change plus change the type of to or something more if the original sql not effecting performance then for simplicity sake leave it as dynamic much less of a head ache to otherwise test out the it should work in oracle 8 and just for i came across nice article on binding that covers the simple problems like though not using variables for in

 guys have a string that looks something like the following with this string i need to be able to do the test end result should be the exact order of the tokens is not that wondering if anyone has any smart ideas of how to go about i was thinking a regex replace on each of the tokens on right and if a replace occur because there was not match just append but maybe there is better the right side should override the the left being what was originally there and the right side being the new another way of looking at is that you only keep the tokens on the left if they exist on the right and you keep all the tokens on the for the the problem is the efficiency with which the solution you i was initially thinking down similar lines but discounted it due to the complexity of the merge n and z is the number tokens on the left and right let alone the splitting and why i was trying to look down the path of a maybe behind the regex is just as bad or but having a regex which removes any token from the left string that exists on the right for the total amount of token on the and then just add the 2 string together vat test test1 seems more thanks token

 had a who was trying to outwit our c optimizer and routine rewrote code that only he could one of his favorite tricks was changing a readable method like up some int int if return if return a long expression here return return 0 input 1 a long expression a long expression a long expression the first line of a method would become and all other logic would be replace by deeply nested terniary when you tried to argue about how this was he would point to the fact that the assembly output of his method was three or four assembly instructions it necessarily any but it was always a bit this was an embedded system where memory usage occasionally did but there were far easier optimizations that could have been made than this that would have left the code after for some reason he decided that was too so he started changing all of these into on the theory that it was more readable and faster as readable code into unreadable code for at the most a and sometimes actually slower

 had this intermittent issue when using my site is dynamically sometimes when i modify a user control my web site complains that it is defined in multiple it almost seems like the old control did not get removed from the temporary files and the updated control is compiled to the same directory so defined in multiple that would make sense to me except for the fact that i have no control over what is in the temporary files read that having circular references will cause made sure that i have circular even with the simplest site seen this noticed that when using master pages this error seems to come up a lot more read that a hotfix tries to fix this issue but gotten this error after applying the i get the file causing the issue and make an edit to it then the error goes even if i just put a space in the file it will resolve the can also get the error to resolve sometimes by visiting other pages of the site that might not use the user control and hitting this does not always i set the site to debug the error never if i set it so that it comiles on a page by page basis then the error does not happen as much but still is what the error looks an error occurred during the compilation of required to service this please following specific error details and modify code error defined in multiple using using even though the error above says i got that error from another source since i reproduce the issue every but the type of error is the gisresearch for your there was one statement in the link you caution even if you have is that if you go in and change something in one of your aspx this page will have to be but this cause an appdomain reload so the whole application is not batch compiled this has the effect that the page will now get recompiled separately and get its own so change your aspx pages on a live server too is a setting in determining how many recompiles are allowed before the app domain by default it is set to so after 15 recompilations the app domain will just as it would if you touched the or touched the bin seems to say that when and the site has already been visited and if you change a page it will only compile that one that sounds like it could cause i had thought changing a page or user control would cause the entire app to is defined in multiple places

 happens at the virtual memory management layer in the operating when you memory map a the memory manager basically treats the file as if it were swap space for the as you access pages in your virtual memory address the memory mapper has to interpret them and map them to physical when you cross a page this may cause a page at which time the os must map a chunk of disk space to a chunk of physical memory and resolve the memory with it simply does so from your file instead of its own swap you want lots of details of how this have to tell us operating system as implementation details

 have a class of data with a very large number of binary to be i am concerned with how to model this data despite the internal efficiencies of storing as my programming spidey senses are tingling at creating a table with 151 addition to other will not be a large number of 1000 and once sent into production will not change very thought of categorizing my data into disjoint subclasses and creating separate tables but splitting the properties in this manner is impracticable and even if possible certainly would not map effectively with the data the other issue is like to keep all the data together and avoid field row i have also considered using some custom binary format but this is not workable as the key field in my data is used as foreign keys in other will make heavy use of where clauses to extract relevant considered using multiple longs or int fields but rejected this as unworkable since i know of no or functions in sql and as noted classification of the properties is not to mention other major software engineering issues this will be using my question here is do i just make a table with a huge number of fields or are there other methods compatible with the relational structures with a large number of bit

 have a couple of one way is that you could say that a word is characters and then take a substring of that append the to the end and display or you could run though the string and count the number of if you assume that there is only one space between each of the then the 100th space will be after then 100th append the ellipsis and you are one has better performance would likely depend upon how the functions are most likely the substring operation is going to be faster than counting the the performance difference might be negligible so unless you are doing this a counting spaces would likely be the most accurate way to just as a the average length of a word in the english language

 have a repository data access pattern like query members void void void the scenario where i have a repository of users have a user name which is if i create a new user with a username that exists i have a dumb ui layer that when i add it to the all is when i hit my repository attempts to save the item to the my database is enforcing these rules luckily and throws me back an aborted exception due to a unique key seems to me generally this validation is done at the layer above the the layers that call it know they should ensure this and will and execute in some kind of transaction scope to avoid but always seem possible with the medium ignorance that my repository be enforcing these what happens if my medium is such as a flat database without any integrity if the repository is validating these kind of how would they inform callers about the violation in a way that the caller can accurately identify what went exceptions seem like a poor way to handle this because their relatively expensive and are hard to specialize down to a specific been playing around with a for canadd with add will call canadd and throw an invalid operation exception if can returns a canadd also returns a list of violations about what went this way i can start to stack these routines through the for the service layer above would also have a method that would return the repositories report any additional violations it wanted to check as more complicated business such as which users can invoke specific of data is such a fundamental yet i feel there is no real guidance for how to handle more advanced validation requirements additionally in this how do you handle validation of entities that are in the repository and are updated via change for repo var user you could this will cause an going deeper down the rabbit imagine got a validation system in place when i add the and i do something like repo var newuser new so far so var otheruser this validating when adding the user was as actions could screw us up the add validation rule would need to check the actual persistence storage and any items queued up to still stop the previous change tracking so now do i start to validate the save changes it seems like there would be a huge amount of violations that could happen from aparently unrelated asking for an perfect safety in my repository enforce validity of if where and

 have already pointed out that this is a result of of quotes and i just wanted to point out that if you look carefully at the structure of the output you you can see how the structure is being built cookie value that getting from is wrapped in quotes the cookie you split on and you have a string that contains you then append a new value to that so that the string contains next time you get that string but with another set of quotes wrapping it but in order to make it so that a web browser will not see two quote characters at the beginning and think all there the inner set of quotes is being so actually returned as then append yet another make another pass back and forth between server and and the next time those backslashes need escaped now you get and so correct as has already been pointed is to let do the parsing instead of chopping up the strings

 have an application that runs multiple threads which are sometimes these threads may call into another object that internally accesses a resources to prevent the resource to be accessed there is a critical section to get some order in the when cancelling the it happens that the thread is just within that code that is blocked by the critical the critical section is locked using an object and i was hoping that upon cancellation of the thread this object would be destructed and consequently release the however this does not seem to be the so that at thread destruction this resource object is permanently the resource object is probably not an option party plus it makes sense to prevent simultaneous access to a resource that can not be used in have experimented with preventing the thread to be cancelled using when the section is however this does feel a bit dirty and would not be a final solution for other situations aquired know that a prefered solution would be to not use but instead set a flag in the thread and it would cancel itself when it is ready a clean however as i want to cancel the thread i was wondering out of academic if there would be other options to do a in a critical

 have been down this road and here are all of the problems you are going to run this looks good for one but what happens when you need 4 other records to create that you end up creating 4 records to test inserting your one this causes all of the following creating and deleting records per test is it will slowly add up and running your tests will take 45 minutes me i was slow tests mean you will never run which means they will be broken most of the time and your delete will fail for some missed foreign key relation or dependency and then trash data will be left in your this trash data will then cause other tests to light of this i would implore you to consider two the first is to try out using an orm instead of writing all this logic then you only need to test your mapping files even less depending on the orm you or look into mocking so you can isolate the logic in your data access code from directly accessing the

 have been getting more and more sick of all the quirks about control trying to get your data in serverside on i seem to spend more time fighting with controls in that i think it takes me more time than i gain by using was thinking about using plain with jquery and a web service that returns json for the only thing i think i would miss from webforms is the the session authentication based on windows login and possibly they have some quirks maybe not for sessions and but i have never developped there something wrong with the am thinking about i think about there things in that i will miss anyone done this before and wants to share experience also take that i only have the framework available for the kind of things giving me troubles in that makes me wonder for the is a sample of a page giving me is a tree table can edit fields on each child you press the save the data from the group row must be updated data from a no modification in data from the child want to refresh the whole page because the displayed records are based from search master details are generated using to update a record from code behind is really and still have no clue about updating the jquery and a web my guess would be that i could update directly to the request what i want to be displayed and just update that this is the kind of things that make me wonder if is just getting in my some details about group childrecord some editable fields savebutton childrecord some editable fields savebutton childrecord some editable fields savebutton childrecord some editable fields savebutton some details about group some details about group problem i have about is not related to i use jquery to make the interfaces more dynamic like showing hiding the search section when not needed and collapsing details from the but this is all i do with bothers me is that if i want to check which button has been clicked in this i have to use some tricks that feel a bit you want to use databound comboboxes in a you have to use codebehind to set the selected it will be a pain to retreive the data if you want to check what data was you have to save the datatable in the read data from all controls in the then compare with the datatable to make an this is this kind of things that bother me with of switching from to bread butter

 have been trying to clean up the naming and organisation conventions of our unit and integration we are using visual studio and seems that if there is one best practice for unit test organisation it is that the layout and naming of the test classes and namespaces should mirror those of the code under as a consequence the file structure will also be it be nice to have a tool that could automatically enforce and help refactor code to conform to these does a tool like this it would be simple for resharper to recognise that ordertest is a test fixture for the order it could then ensure that the order class exists and that it is in the same if the order class underwent refactoring and was the ordertest class should also be for keeping unit tests organised and named

 have done a good job of explaining your so let me help you decode the error match expected type against inferred type the putstrln is show missed off all the other the they just show more and more enclosing in haskell is an so therefore everything has a that includes something like if you type in ghci you will see it string io means that putstrln is a function that takes a string and returns an which in this case is the action of putting the message on the in your code you gave a so the compiler inferred that the expression had the type that is the part of the compiler error the compiler was also doing type inference in the other from the outside amongst other things it noticed that the this expression seemed to be applied to an empty which has type a list of we know furthermore the result of the whole expression should be of type therefore the expression should be a function to turn into a list of the type of which is written that is the part of the error this point the compiler concluded that it could not match up these two so it reported the match expected type against inferred type is probably the commonest error message you get when trying to compile so its worth trying to read it and understand look at the inferred type and try to figure out what part of the quoted expression has that then try to figure out why the compiler expected something else by looking at the surrounding

 have found that the best answer to a performance question is to profile guidelines are but there is so many variables that can impact performance such as the size of your the types of queries you are the or something similar and try it out different use the articles linked to by but make sure you actually test what helps and what is also a good chance that any performance differences you can get from lucene will be minor compared to performance improvements in the profiler will point that out as

 have recently begin creating an image editing tool which will cater to a very specific this is as much for the people who are going to use it as it is for my own i have hit a bit of an architectural snag early any image the user will use to draw on and manipulate an my first attempt at this consisted of a simple interface void graphics g other would be nice and clean and would allow for easy maintenance and just add the interface objects in and call the draweffect method of the selected one at problem with this approach is that different drawing tools do not cleanly adhere to a single for a pen tool need only know the point to draw at in order to the rectangle however needs the first point as well as the current the polygon tool needs to keep track of multiple mouse am having trouble thinking of a nice way to implement the best method that i can think of now would involve a switch statement and a case for each which would mean that the drawing logic would be in the canvas not encapsulated by tool type because this is i would like to do this the right thanks for any help in level design pattern for image editing

 have several sql server 2000 databases we need to that have the same structure and have them set up to replicate to another the problem is that whenever i have to change the structure is usually pretty easy to do on all especially with tools from red i have to stop the make the structure and then set up replication the steps to set up replication only take a few minutes to do for each database but repetitive and drives me i have the ide create a script of the replication procedure and then just replace the name of the prior database with the name of the next database and run the still annoying but faster than clicking though the ide and forgetting an tried things like using the but that look very guess is i should just use the tsql that gets generated from the ide and use that as a starting point to build a new tsql script have it pass the name of the database as a and then when something changes with the structure of the database i need to address that in the tsql replication script and make the changes is this an issue for anyone does 2005 or 2008 have a better so i have to mainting some crazy script and just have the ide generate a script when there are changes that i could then use on multiple databases the same replication script on several

 have some bit more than a code where object values from a datareader are assigned to business object this code is quite untidy to look at with lots of null i was wondering how to implement a tidier means of converting the object values from the datareader to the appropriate values for the object option is to have discrete conversion functions for each data where the data types on my object properties are limited to a small set of clr primitive i use nullable as then just be moving the untidiness to where these values are used second option is to create an extension method for each of the four or so data types limited to the niche namespace in which these assignments take something like this rather simplistic public static void string object if is target target other options do i to safely assign db values to object

 have this big graph of edges and vertices in 2d the big graph is returned by a function computed in a i am reading this graph and using it to compute all the intersections of its edges lines i use sweep for detecting the intersection of two edges i have though some i have 4 different methods according to which i test if two edges intersect and if affirmative i compute and retain their which test if the two edges are the diagonals of a that coordinates of the edges of one line inserted into the equation other line have different which computes the intersection each time and check whether intersection is between the endpoints of both which is the code from implemented in which implements the first method proposed by jason cohen problem reduces to this do two lines from a to b and from c to d then you can ask it four times the line and each of the four sides of the the vector math for doing assuming the line from a to b is the line in question and the line from c to d is one of the rectangle my notation is that ax is the of and cy is the of and means so ex p f p h number is the if h is between 0 and the lines otherwise they if is of course you cannot make the but in this case the lines are parallel and therefore only intersect in the obvious exact point of intersection is c h is exactly 0 or 1 the lines touch at an you can consider this an or not as you see data that i created data with double i obtained good results with all the 4 implemented when i use anyone of these methods implemented in on the data from the big graph i get different results each time and not good returns much more intersections that i need the points are on the but i get too many always obtain 0 intersections no matter get a lot more intersection than in some example i get points which are not on the graph not even the but for some examples i get the intersection points plus some other have no idea where the problem can any suggestion or any other idea on how to compute the intersection and test it moreover are ore than thank intersection of two

 have worked on both green field project with fully unit tested code bases and large applications that have grown over many years and with many different developers on i would not bother an attempt to get a legacy code base to the state where units tests and test first development can add a lot of a legacy code base gets to a certain size and complexity getting it to the point where unit test coverage provides you with a lot of benefits becomes a task equivalent to a full main problem is that as soon as you start refactoring for testability you will begin introducing and only once you get high test coverage can you expect all those new bugs to be found and means that you either go very slowly and carefully and you do not get the benefits of a well unit tested code base until years from never since mergers etc in the mean time you are probably introducing some new bugs with no apparent value to the end user of the you go fast but have an unstable code base until all you have reached high test coverage of all your you end up with 2 one in one for the cause this all a matter of scale for some projects a rewrite might just take a few weeks and can certainly be worth

 having trouble covering all the issues with doing software configuration management on a cms writing custom of but also custom modules and these websites and apps are for not want to actually version the configuration of the not just the code of its templates and because i want it to be ready to for or transfer to someone as quickly as right that means storing a full install for each site in including the installed versions of components and and storing actual database for i also keep the version of the code i usually bother for the since you can just drop it into the install and it problem with this that currently debating is in custom component in most other extensions are typically deployed using a web installer you least just drop the files in a certain since db changes are the installer system provides for db and file migration with install and uninstall so a pretty reasonable system for i work directly on the installed adding and changing files and then manually copying them to the packaged version of the work on the packaged component and use the installer to actually view the this option just takes too long but it does have the advantage of keeping the code especially in regard to db either the changes are duplicated to both versions of the files before and the duplication seems like a smell to does anyone else do are there better for

 hope is not lost it possible to raise an event on a com object from outside of the this functionality is actually provided by com although in an indirect events work on a a com object that has events publishes and one or more other com objects subscribe to the event by attaching an event handler to the source object handlers are called the source object raises an event by simply looping through all the event sinks and calling the appropriate handler how does this help it just so happens that com lets you query an event source for a list of all the event sink objects currently subscribed to the source once you have a list of event sink you can simulate raising an event by invoking each of the sink event the details and being liberal with some of the but the short somewhat politically version of how events work in can take advantage of this knowledge to raise events on a com object from external in it is possible to do all of this in with the help of the com interop support in the and wrote a utility class that will allow you to raise events on a com object from pretty easy to here is an example using the event interface from your legacycomobject new the following code assumes other com objects have already subscribed to the myobj message event at this vb6 objects have two hidden interfaces for classes that raise one the default two the event we want the second because it gives us a that we can use to raise the the method is a convenience that returns all the objects listening to events from the legacy com set up the params for the messagedata cancel raise the event by invoking the event delegate for each connected sink in raise the event via the event ref do cancel processing an is the code for the class well as helper because paranoid and wanted a nice way to deal with the needed by the thoroughly tested the code the code performs manual memory management in a few and therefore there is the possibility that it could introduce memory leaks into your i add to the because this is only an use with com a utility class for dealing with com needs and could potentially be into a regular i extensively tested this there may be a memory leak somewhere due to the stuff going on in the but i think i covered static class get a list of all objects implementing an event sink interface that are listening for events on a specified com event sink com object whose event sinks you want to list of objects that implement the given event sink interface and are actively listening for events from the specified com public static sinks new connectionpoints loop through the source connection find the objects that are listening for events at each connection and add the objects we are interested in to the connectionpoint in connections foreach connection in object candidate i tried to avoid relying on for but returning an empty catch need to release the interface pointer in each connectdata because getconnectiondata implicitly foreach connection in return get all the event connection points for a given com com object that raises list of iconnectionpoint instances for the com private static connectionpointcontainer oneconnectionpoint new connectionpoints new int fetchcount safeintptr pfetchcount new if fetchcount if while return returns a list of connectdata instances representing the event sink connections to the given iconnectionpoint to return connection data list of connectdata instances representing all the current event sink connections to the given connection private static oneconnectdata new connectdataobjects new int fetchcount safeintptr pfetchcount new if fetchcount if while return class a simple wrapper class around an intptr manages its own class safeintptr private bool private intptr allocates storage for an int and assigns it to this the value defaults to public allocates storage for an assigns it to this and initializes the memory to known value this that this points to public gets or sets the value this pointer is pointing public int get if throw new pointer has been return set if throw new pointer has been returns an intptr representation of this public intptr return deallocates the memory for this public void if if class namespace

 i assume allows you to reuse session identifier only if we operate in cookieless but not if we use cookies to store session from my allows you to reuse a session for if you make a request and your query string contains an expired creates a new session and uses that session the problem is that a session id might inadvertently appear in a public place such as in a results page in a search this could lead to multiple users accessing the server with the same session identifier and then all joining the same session with the same shared not sure i understand how reusing session identifier could cause session id to appear in a results page in a search avoid this potential security recommended that you include the optional regenerateexpiredsessionid attribute and set it to true whenever you use cookieless this a new session id will be issued if a user connects with an expired session the only drawback is that this process also forces the current page to lose all view state and form because performs a redirect to make sure the browser has a new session needs to perform a redirect to make sure browser has a new session it just extract session id from the url and throw it when using if a client sends an invalid session id a stale cookie for the server will reject the generate a new id and send that value back in the cookie with the to be sure i understand what you are session is and if you make a but your cookie contains a session id of an already expired then server will generate a new if session is cookieless thus id is contained in url then by default will create new session using that same the redirect is performed to ensure that the client received the new session id value and properly sends it back with the just a that why it instead just put new session id in a url and send it there must be a reason why this work and thus redirect is session

 i do my coding i sometimes wonder if doing things the best way or just the way always been does what doing make sense declaring all your variables at the top of the if i try to declare it twice or below where i start using it my ide will bark at me at design time so the big it seems like it would make more sense to declare the variables right above the block where be one would be hungarian i hate that all my variables related to a particular object are scattered throughout my modern advancements in frameworks and are there some coding practices that really apply anymore and others that may be just plain wrong coding

 i have a legacy php4 system that i continuously need to add features it look like there will be resources to do a port to php5 for several months if not several over the course of the past few one of the major things that has bothered me is not having the ability to throw exceptions because of all kinds of error checking code has to constantly interrupt the flow of going on to the what is the best strategy that you have seen to emulate the cleanliness of exception handling in languages that have no exception has this to say regarding exceptions as noted in an create too many possible exit points for a to write correct you really have to think about every possible code path through your every time you call a function that can raise an exception and catch it on the you create opportunities for surprise bugs caused by functions that terminated leaving data in an inconsistent or other code paths that you think better alternative is to have your functions return error values when things go and to deal with these no matter how verbose it might it is true that what should be a simple 3 line program often blossoms to 48 lines when you put in good error but and papering it over with exceptions does not make your program more i think the reason programmers in style languages have been attracted to exceptions is simply because the syntax does not have a concise way to call a function that returns multiple so hard to write a function that either produces a return value or returns an a good exception model in a language makes the called function specify that it will in fact throw an this implies that there are exaactly zero additional places for the function to exit from code would just return false instead of throwing an but there is exactly 1 additional place for the function to exit the catch block of the calling anyone write sloppy code that passes all exceptions upward to be dealt with by others but that mean you take away a tool that can be used cleanly and any function can return a value that is out of range of the expected return values from the calling a good programmer is going to deal with all possible return including error codes and the exception model just gives him a way to do it alternative exception handling

 i realize this question was asked and but i have specific questions about this that i feel were not clear on that thread and prefer not to get lost in the shuffle on another thread as threads said that rendering the email address to an image the way facebook does is overkill and unprofessional user experience for and it seems that the general consensus is to use a javascript solution using html entities or some other method that breaks up makes the string unreadable by a simple the application building even need the i just need to display the email this is a business web so it needs to as professional as here are my i go the route and pass the html entity version of each are there no web crawlers sophisticated enough to execute the javascript and pull the rendered text or is this considered best practice and completely almost spammer so unprofessional about the image if facebook is one of the highest trafficked applications in the world and not at all run by why is their method completely dismissed in the other thread about this your answer in the other is to not bother myself with this issue and let the spam filters do all the please explain why you feel this we are displaying our email addresses that they have given and i feel responsible to protect them as much as i if you feel this is please explain obfuscation

 i run cygwin with using the following startup black 8192 white 150x56 gives me a resizeable native windows window which is much better than the standard the default the current configuration does have a couple of am not able to enter characters into the terminal window and which i use in the terminal will not even accept them when i paste them into the if i paste a string like for all i get is am not able to render they only show as even if they are supported by the font when rendering the same characters in they show just am running english windows vista with locale and keyboard layout set to norwegian character but had the exact same issue on windows 2000 and knows how to fix this a better way to configure from the issues mentioned very happy with so if i find a way to resolve them like to continue using if the issues are not are the any other good terminal solutions for solution provided by andy and mattias the did solve the input but output rendering is still an output is fine when i render in but when using i only get for this behavior is consistent between cygwin xfree x and there a similar configuration file where output encoding can be set the equivalent of setting output locale on a linux terminal environment for

 i suffered a lot with the same dilemma when i moved to it really depends on your from the java ee world so i would recommend to have as little business logic in your backing beans as if the logic is purely related to the presentation of your then it is fine to have it in the backing believe one of the strengths of jsf is actually the fact that you can expose domain objects directly on the managed i would therefore strongly recommend the otherwise you end up making too much work for yourself in manually exposing each furthermore it would be a bit of a mess when inserting or updating data if you encapsulated all the there are situations where a single domain object may not be in those cases i prepare a before exposing it on the if you are going to encapsulate every object property that you want to i would recommend that you instead bind ui components to the backing bean and then inject the content directly into the value of the terms of bean structure the turning point for me was when i forcefully ignored all the stuff i knew about building web applications and started treating it as a gui application jsf mimics swing a lot and therefore the best practices for developing swing applications would mostly also apply to building jsf

 i think doing two you have a scaled version of as long as the relationship between this time and time remains constant fairly sure just delegate this scaling behavior to a single that would have signatures virtualtimespan be using this to map virtual time spans to instances of thereafter you can operate in which probably simplifies things a little since you can the use standard scheduling second part regards scheduling work for a future worker a number of core technologies working with conceptually i think is the of a lot of it defines concepts much like the ones using and what you i think taking a look at jms is fine for seeing concepts you may find it uses selectors to send tasks to specific much like the ones you jms never seemed to fit the bill for most a lot of people found it was too heavyweight or the implementations too so usually people ended up with home made queue but the concepts are all you just use quartz

 i think it fits to your application but there has to be a clear distinction between the people and tasks functions to make it scott has a point that it might be somewhat in contrast to what microsoft intended to use the ribbon it think the ribbon also fits to this kind of if you wanted to have a conventional tab like michael suggests you would need buttons to switch between the windows or by using the ribbon you directly link the controlling with the making it easier to learn what buttons are linked to what buttons that are used for the whole app can be integrated into the office button large office logo in the top left which is actually exactly what microsoft are currently implementing a toolbar as so probably not entirely however i tend to think the ribbon works quite simple and enables users to easily discover one this could also be achieved by using large and dropdown just easy that most ribbon packages available have these things so no need to code it yourself you can very

 i understand it software being open source does not prevent you from selling it this depend on the type of but is this a good my pet project the target audience is for the most part who know how to compile the source but i still want to keep it open mostly for possible future employers to view my as well as to get critique from or just for others to learn expect to quit my day job from it or mostly just to defray minor costs like web domain and other misc and hopefully some pocket support really an and app and one of the primary objectives is to make it as easy to use as closest license that sounds like be friendly to this is the but google code which currently using support that and a quick search looks like sourceforge either could be currently but i just have a few classes stubbed out right so changing an there any examples of other people doing this or am i better off just asking for should i just not license it as open source it automatically closed source if i have any license but just distribute it upon any other options i thought what more interested aside from the legal aspect is whether the practice of straight selling open source software is generally frowned will i piss off customers that bought it and later found out it was open should i announce it on the site or keep a link from to retail site but not the other way announce it but not make it software as open source but charging for compiled

 i understand there are tasks that take a lot of is and as you just about every website has a registration process and the while i agree that implementing such features over and over again can be to some each application will have its own unique set of requirements meaning there will be at least a little customization work even if reusing code from an older i will now have a bash at answering your numbered zend use some of prototypes written to out a basic site i would not choose the zf for a nor would i use any mvc my current assumption is that a basic site consists of about 8 to 12 separate with no really special and finite remember that once we say there is almost always a noticeable performance in addition to whatever bugs and issues which might be inherent within that you speak of would be in the classes available within the zend for for creating a fully featured authentication system in about 15 or are there some site source to be built upon already though i have to my worst nightmare would be having to support an application built on some kind of framework that wraps another image how much fun debugging it would imagine how much fun teaching someone to support it would already using a not get greedy is there some app generator minor tool for pages with records not quite sure what you mean by but if i had to chance a perhaps zend

 i wanted to introduce a friend to the wonderful world of python orm which i still know little databases are extremely fragmented and at times under normalized and over making out of it at this point is too much work have lots of legacy php code working with so the best i could think of was using sqlsoup to introspect our tables so he have to write any mappers which he liked the fact that selecting all columns and records from tables was easier this updating single items was also very easy since it could be done with a single everything else seems to take more code than custom sql he thrilled when i select just a few but what really bothered me is that even simple filters are more not easier than raw sql a custom querying object that does and from mytable where foo and foo considering that we have to learn every mysql function so except for the database agnosticism that we how can sqlalchemy any python make my life am i missing about

 in any practical understand why helpful to compare drm with encryption is a mechanism to share secrets with trusted second parties without the possibility of a untrusted party receiving the secret encryption is built upon a very solid background of and works because the second party is considered to be trustworthy of the key to unlock the secret on the other assigns no trust to any party except the original the assumption is that the second party has a revocable right to the secret and is not to pass the message to any other even if they want the problem with that is the second party must somehow still decrypt the even though they are not trusted with the ability to do this is the basic conceptual challenge of accomplishes this using two first is the algorithms and keys used to encrypt or decrypt the managed message are themselves kept patent encumbrance is used on some usually the decoding so that the parties that do know that part are prevented legally from disclosing it to other or using it at all without proper of these features are in opposition to open by its very open source discloses any bit of code released under supposedly open source that happens to also be patent encumbered fails to in fact be free

 injection can happen any time you pass a query back to the a simple injection within is to do as dave webb has it will prevent the injection attempt by encompassing the entire string as one parameter to be handling all characters that might be interpreted by sql server to change the query or append additional it should be pointed out that sql injection can occur on any not just web and that an internal attack is usually the most costly to an one cannot safely assume that an attack originate from brian

 intend on writing a small download manager in that supports resuming multiple connections per the info i gathered so when sending the http request i need to add a header field with a key of and the value then the server returns a http response with the data between those roughly what i have in mind is to split the file to the number of allowed connections per file and send a http request per splitted part with the appropriate so if i have a 4mb file and 4 allowed split the file to 4 and have 4 http requests each with the appropriate implementing the resume feature would involve remembering which offsets are already downloaded and simply not request this the right way to do if the web server support guess is it will ignore the and just send the entire sending the http should i specify in the range the entire splitted or maybe ask smaller say 1024k per reading the should i write it immediately to the file or do some kind of i guess it could be wasteful to write small i use a memory mapped if i remember recommended for frequent reads rather than writes could be is it memory what if i have several downloads not using a memory mapped should i open the file per allowed or when needing to write to the file simply i did use a memory mapped file this would be really since i could simply have several probably be using but this is a general question so i left code out of a download manager that supports

 is a conceptual basis for database classical database there are three and conceptual model emerges from requirements and evolves as the underlying subject matter evolves or as understanding of the subject matter the conceptual model pins down elementary data as to form and but deal with such issues as table logical model uses the relational model of it can be derived from the conceptual but it also deals with the composition of normalization and other composition issues come into play the logical model anticipates the table and also the queries and updates the application will physical model implements relations as and also adds all the other features like needed to actually build the derived from the logical but data and disk space all come into sounds lengthy and but actually if you know how to do the whole thing can be done in a matter of while the rest of the team is still debating functional for a really small project 50 it can be done in with just pencil and for larger there are tools that make design more less error and easily what happens when you discover that the conceptual model was inaccurate or and the other two models and the database itself need to be where comes to the data independence does for database design what encapsulation does for object it prevents a minor adjustment in one place from propagating all over the application objects are only dependent on the data that they a new table has to be added to a the chances that any application will be broken is vanishingly even if an existing table has to be queries that only use the old columns see any even when objects are dependent on the you can still give the altered table a new and then create a view with the old name that makes it look like the old table is still physical data independence is almost complete in a good you can reorganize add and drop and you have to change any of the change management can be done brilliantly using the really good dbms products out a lot of the dbas and programmers know how to make adequate use of these dbms even though they have been around for

 is a really challenging problem to generate synthetic sounds that sound there are many techniques some some really to get good results you will have to use one of the more complex synthesis synthesis modulation distortion synthesis modeling are some synthesis methods taken from physical modeling can produce really good sounds but this shows in the complexity of the method the idea is the implementation should probably start with additive for this just add sine waves of the fundamental frequency and integer for example 440 1320 the amplitude should drop exponentially with the information about the structure of the components is best found in scientific papers about music instrument finally you must modulate the amplitude of the signal with an timevarying the structure for a guitar can be found in mentioned links from a guitar string and sound a really simple approximation of full physical modeling with differential maybe quite limited to guitar strings and similar but exactly what you are looking for and surely simpler to do than tuning a additive i will try it myself if i find some time over the really exited what one can get out of the

 is an answer i posted to a question a while i modified it a bit to fit this has shown me that there are 3 major goals you have when learning a legacy learn what the code is supposed to learn how it does learn why it does them the way it three of those parts are very and a few tricks to help you get resist the temptation to just whatever your ide your way around the code to understand you probably be able to keep everything in perspective in your mind this especially when each line forces you to look at multiple other classes in order to understand what it so you need to be able to hold several levels of the stack in your documentation where it usually helps you quickly gain a mental framework upon which to build everything that test cases where be afraid to ask someone who knows if you have a you waste time with inane but if something that you simply understand is especially true with more conceptual questions it make much more sense to implement this as a or probably worth finding out the answer before you mess something up and know you do finally get down to reading the start at a logical place and go from just read the code top to or in alphabetical or anything is probably

 is answered in answer to can i tell whether a certain element is contained in a list or search the you could search through the list of all questions in using your favorite the command you can use the switch to perldoc to search for you would have found your answer by searching for of this answer contributed by anno siegel and brian d the word is an indication that you probably should have used a not a list or to store your hashes are designed to answer this question quickly and arrays being there are several ways to approach in perl and you can use the smart match operator to check that an item is contained in an array or a say array contains say hash contains earlier versions of you have to do a bit more if you are going to make this query many times over arbitrary string the fastest way is probably to invert the original array and maintain a hash whose keys are the first cerulean teal turquoise 1 you can check whether it might have been a good idea to keep the blues all in a hash in the first the values are all small you could use a simple indexed this kind of an array will take up less 1 or simply x you check whether the values in question are integers instead of you can save quite a lot of space by using bit strings 2017 1 check whether is true for some methods guarantee fast individual tests but require a of the original list or they only pay off if you have to test multiple values against the same you are testing only the standard module exports the function first for this it works by stopping once it finds the written in c for and its perl equivalent looks like this first my foreach return if speed is of little the common idiom uses grep in scalar context returns the number of items that passed its to traverse the entire this does have the benefit of telling you how many matches it grep eq you want to actually extract the matching simply use grep in list grep eq

 is based on previous experiences with what i consider to be the best practices on the scale of the code this can range from another developer to the whole team in the case of something big being added to the overall for small the review is mainly a way to double check what was done while on the larger everyone should know what is going on and be able to ask questions to those who put in the new to it for large it makes sense to have more eyes on it while if the code change was to fix a that merit the same any completion of a code bug or new functionality should merit some form of diffing in subversion is useful for some reviews though think there should be other stuff out i just seen few other reviews can vary from seeing the differences in code and results of the application to going line by line through pages of printed out i like a more formal structure which tries to be simple in terms of communicating what was why and seeing that it does what it should for big this can take hours but then if the developers that did the work went on vacation and it had to be changed asap it would take longer to understand what is going on in some i

 is because you have to accepts an instance and returns its in this case you have to compare two you need to do preemptive it is better if you check for a supported interface than the type does not really tell you apart of the fact that your code want an instance of a specific regardless of the fact that you could have another instance of a completely different type which would be perfectly fine because it implements the same suppose you have this return suppose you i want this code to accept only a if raise accepts only a return is reducing the reusability of this it work if you pass a or a or a something better would be if not and raise return no point in doing will raise an exception if the protocol is not satisfied this of course unless you want to prevent side effects or having to recover from calls that you could invoke before just to make the if not and raise return this your code will raise an exception before running the without interface you would have removed the and then raised the

 is hard to give an answer to this without seeing a lot more detail about what you are trying to i would not normally inherit from collection as it does not really give enough virtual methods to this can make altering the behaviour of your class a little tricky in the trouble with inheritance is that if you use it you will be stuck with the collection base behaviour forever or face a complex for you may want to add searching and sorting operations at which point you will need to switch to list from you may even want to do data binding where you will need a bindinglist instead of a different plan would be to inherit from icollection or better still and then delegate to a private collection this gives you maximum control and allows you to alter the internal representation of your class without affecting the public the trouble with this is that it takes longer to develop you what you are facing is a trade off between faster development and future and as i said at the start it is a bit difficult to judge which way to go from the information given in the original to make an implementation simply return true from isreadonly and then throw a notsupportedexception from all the methods that alter the

 is important to get as much information as possible about errors that are occurring back to the development log files are good in cases where there are no users to experice the error condition and you can be certain that someone is checking the log automatic email is great for server based alert messages are problematic because users never read one trick worked for me is to copy a detailed error trace on to the clipboard while a user friendly error is then train users to paste the error trace into an email error the web equivalent is to display a friendly message while sending a detailed error in an email to the development team from the should be a log of last in other what happens when writing to the log file causes an there should also be built in protection against type problems in which error handling itself locks the system on desktop sloppy error handling code can result in a never ending cascade of message boxes that leave no option but to kill the possibly losing data in the similar problems can result if error handling code triggers the error handling framework should detect error handling errors and stop reporting errors if there is no better vital batch nothing beats a proactive notification of if the email the user knows even if the error handling is should be caught at all event public component and service methods should catch all exceptions that in some an exception makes for when an exception is caught in a web service a soap exception should be but it is a bad idea to allow an excpetion to percolate across a component boundary it is usually a bad idea to catch exceptions on private methods of or in methods that are nested in the middle of a complex internal process of a it make sense to handle an exception in this context unless you can recover from the this internal code must be structured so that all resources will be released and database transactions rolled back in the presence of catch blocks in every method are the sign of using and finally blocks are a sign of a sound error handling that exceptions are exceptional you were expecting they be called rather than trying to anticipate when errors might concentrate on shoring up your component even trivial code that could not possibly experience an error should have a catch block if it sits on a that way when the code is modified later in unexpected ways the architecture will still component boundary may require a different reporting in the case of components that are design to run in different provide an error handling interface that client code can use to catch error forget the log of last resort if someone forgets to hook the error handling sum detailed error information the development team errors always at component only at component all code exception let the error handling part of the

 is more but not the analogy with physical locks is pretty by putting two physical locks of the same type on a you ensure that a thief that can pick one lock in five minutes now need to spend ten but you might be much better off by buying a lock that was twice as which the thief could not pick at cryptography it works much the same in the general you cannot ensure that encrypting twice makes it more than twice as hard to break the so if nsa normally can decrypt your message in five with double they need ten you would probably be much better off by instead doubling the length of the which might make them need 100 years to break the a few it makes sense to repeat the encryption but you need to work the math with the specific algorithm to prove for is basically des repeated three times with three different keys that you instead of just encrypting three but this also shows how unintuitive this because while the number of it only has the effective of the des	
 is more depth of what though it will be interesting to see if others agree or what they have to how computers work you have hardware that has integer and and a vast array of random access and instructions which are mostly of the form on reading the value of this go poke this new value into this memory cells has all kinds of perf implications when it comes to cache lines and coherency and memory models and integers are 32 or 64 and nearly all programming languages surface these data types that exactly match the nearly every runtime works with a small call stack where objects are and a more expensive where other objects can be created and destroyed when are consider most modern functional programming immutability is the you will rarely memory with new means you create more which means you allocate lambdas and continuations are the you more rarely have object lifetimes that correspond to the some fp runtimes use a in a cps implementation the notion of stack and program counter are recursion is a looping so you at least need calls to not consume the stack practically everything needs to and of course you need a algebraic data types provide tagged in theory these tags would only require an extra 2 or 3 bits of but to match the they often need to have an extra word of memory or i am kind of but the things you do in an fp language tend to correspond to exactly to the things that or are on the typical computer hardware architecture and basic language have to be that one can imagine a world where the runtime eschews a and makes fast not a bottleneck for one can imagine a world where the interoperable integer types have 29 or 60 and the use the extra leftover bits of the word for the or algebraic type or think some fp do some of these the point if you take a modern functional language as a and then design around it would look very different from the typical of think i communicated that and i am imprecise about many details i know but hopefully you grok the gist of my thesis

 is more likely an issue of not initializing variables to some initial so in debug they have some sort of but in most things are initialized zero some may be taking that you do not without your source code for really hard to spot has bit me more than is assuming you are not expecting to see anything using stuff like as make sure your packets are under 1024 bytes in or you will not get took me a while to figure this one out back when xp came and i figure out why my code worked on but not even though send would return it never actually sent the dealt with udp a lot on so if you give me some example code i should be able to help check that all your variables are initialized to some sort of default value on both the sender and the is just good and then it and try check your packet size with a before it and if greater than 1024 also a good idea to check size of the received and if not exactly the size you then drop the this holds more true for but still me know if any of this i posted a lot of udp code on here a little while and that code you might want to refer to

 is nothing especially about function they allow you to call a function which is specified at but you have exactly the same overhead as get from any other function call the additional pointer since the function to call is determined at the compiler can typically not inline the function call as it could anywhere as function pointers may in some cases add up to be significantly slower than a regular function pointers have nothing to do with and should never be used to gain they are a very slight nod to the functional programming in that they allow you to pass a function around as parameter or return value in another simple example is a generic sorting it has to have some way to compare two elements in order to determine how they should be this could be a function pointer passed to the sort and in fact can be used exactly like if you ask it to sort sequences of a type that does not define the less than you have to pass in a function pointer it can call to perform the this leads us nicely to a superior in not limited to function you often use functors instead that classes that overload the so that they can be as if they were functors have a couple of big advantages over function offer more with destructor and member they can maintain and they may expose other member functions that the surrounding code can are unlike function whose type only encode the signature of the function variable of type may be function which takes an int and returns we know which a type encodes the precise function that should be called a functor is a call it we know that the function to call and will always and this means the compiler can inline the function the magic that makes the generic just as fast as your sorting function designed specifically for your the compiler can eliminate all the overhead of calling a are very little type safety in a function you have no guarantee that it points to a valid it could be and most of the problems with pointers apply to function pointers as dangerous and pointers or functors or delegates all solve the same with different levels of elegance and they allow you to treat functions as passing them around as you would any other you can pass a function to another and it will call your function at specified times a timer when the window needs or when it needs to compare two elements in your far as i know i could be because i worked with java for java have a direct you have to create a which implements an and defines a function it for and then instead of calling the function the shape of a function functor or you call similar to the implementation in but without the generality of and without the function syntax that allows you to treat function pointers and functors the same that is where you use function when more sophisticated alternatives are not available you are stuck in and you need to pass one function to the most common scenario is a you define a function f that you want the system to call when x so you create a function pointer pointing to and pass that to the system in forget about john carmack and assume that anything you sees in his code will magically make your code better if you copy he used function pointers because the games you mention were written in where superior alternatives are not and not because they are some magical ingredient whose mere existence makes code run

 is so much misinformation in the answers in this thread that i know where to i just spent 4 points in reputation voting down the answers with misleading and wrong information in jet database engine is all involved as the op clarified with an is by default it was built from the ground up to be that a jet data store is reliable when the network is not this means not a wan and not because the bandwidth has to be sufficient for jet to maintain the ldb file which means a ping by your local instance of the jet database engine once per second default and because jet recover from a dropped connection is quite common in a wireless situation where access falls down is when a access application mdb is shared is not the case for this the reason it fails is because sharing things that be reliably shared and have no reason to be because of the way access objects are stored in an mdb file entire access project is stored in a single blob field in one record in one of the system very prone to corruption if multiple users open in my sharing an access front end an unsplit mdb with the tables and all in one is the source for of corruptions of basic answer to the question is jet would be a great data store for an app of that if any possibility at all for the user population to grow above then it might be better to start off from scratch with a database engine that is more robust at higher user

 is the replacement for a server control in what i want to do is to create a declarative and imperative binding so i can would mean that an instance of the mycontrol class will be created and possibly rendered want any viewstate or postback just the i also want these modules to be contained in a separate class so viewusercontrols will not do for using a server controls in the normal way but it generates a form tag and a viewstate which i do not want if i can avoid have seen and about how to use server controls in but they do not provide enough i found the when i added the user control using the it automatically created a which i if i simply remove that everything works to server controls in	
 is the same idea as that of sets a numeric if the input is not a it changes it to what you can exploit here to do your enter a equ 0 goto gtr 0 echo userinput is a equ 0 echo userinput is not a invalid user an you could always create a little javascript file and call it from your with you could force the input to be an or you could roll your own function to test the the javascript is just as fast as the but much more no ide or compiler notepad will runs on every windows just like your so why not make use of can even mix batchfiles and of of can now call this from a batchfile to make your script sleep for 10 something like that is difficult to do with just a plain van

 is very misleading and it seems to me that the author does understand the finer just that he appears to want to the key point that shows the flaw in argument is the operator standard defines that the above function has the following intentionally performs no other restate that this function performs no other this is very as it is the key to what placement new it is used to call the constructor for the and all it notice explicitly that the parameter is not even those without to summarise my everything that does in c can be done in using the only difference is that if you have non aggregate types that need to have their destructors and constructors then you need to call those constructor and such types do not explicitly exist in and so using the argument that does it is not if you have a struct in that has a special function which must be called with a corresponding then all points made by the author apply equally to that struct as they do to a some of his points implement multiple the compiler must actually change the values of pointers during some it know which value you eventually want when converting to a void no ordinary function can perform the role of malloc in is no suitable return is not again performs the role of a1 a2 b public public a2 foo void v new b b new placement new calls the constructor for delete v new int i delete i mention we need placement new to call the constructor for in the case of we can cast from to without a although again using placement new would improve type point he makes is about alignment returned by new will not necessarily meet the alignment requirements of a struct standard under pointer returned shall be suitably aligned so that it can be converted to pointer of any complete object type and then used to access the object or array in the storage allocated the storage is explicitly deallocated by a call to a corresponding deallocation to me appears pretty specialized allocators the author describes potential problems that you might you need to use the allocator as an argument to any types which allocate memory themselves and the constructed objects will need to have their destructors called how is this different to passing the allocator object through to an call for a c calling the in you can easily create a special kind of smart call it which we can define to call the destructor explicitly when it goes out of as a result we could if t arena foo new must be pfp new automatically last point i want to comment on is the comes with a operator defined as void void return noted not just implemented this way but it is required to be so by the obj be a class with a suppose you have sizeof bytes of memory somewhere and would like to construct 10 objects of type obj at that defines sizeof to be 10 sizeof can you do so with this placement operator for the following code would seem to do void return new serious this code is in there is no guarantee that the argument passed to operator really corresponds to the size of the array being as he highlights by supplying the the size argument is not used in the allocation the allocation function does and so the only affect of the above placement expression is to call the constructor for the 10 array elements as you would are other issues with this but not the one the author

 it has something to do with memory the first loop indexes the inner dimension of which happens to span over only 3 bytes each within one memory page easily believe a common size here is 4kb for one but with your second the outer index changes that will cause memory reads spread over a much larger range of memory namely which is and with each change of the inner those jumps start to happen that will hit different pages and is probably somewhat also i heard the cpu reads ahead that will make the first version because at the time it that data is probably already in the i can imagine the second version benefit from because it makes those large jumps around the memory back and would suspect the difference is not that but if the algorithm runs many it eventually becomes you probably want to read the article on that is the scheme used to store arrays in

 it is really a binary and you have actual binary data in it embedded then you need to be careful not to use any of the members that can treat it as a c string with a terminating as you will obviously end up losing class is not really appropriate for this purpose it is written on the assumption that what you are working with is actually a string of characters since you are using a blob or array of binary a is probably more insert the data will require you to bind the content of the vector to the sql query using bind that is to instead of using to execute a string containing the sql you should use to create the statement handle you leave the spot where the value of the binary value would go with a then use to bind the placeholder to the binary you then call the function using are some code examples in the documentation

 just recently started writing a new winforms application from scratch using structuremap for previously looked at scsf and but found those overly wrote some fluent apis on top of structuremaps registry so our modules can register presenters and my experience it has been worth the effort in all i would never want to write a winforms app without using these tools and the highly structured modular approach

 justification is a common and supported well in you want to use an environment within each line of latex with will correspond to one and you can choose which character you would like to have aligned on each line by placing an ampersand in your b c do something like what after on how you want to justify the first this will number each equation for reference in the if this is not required or use an environment adding a star after the environment name is a common idiom in latex which means number and can be used for sections and so forth as another interpretation of the justification i think you text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text c 12m of length of great 6m measure of 8m measure of it is in can place multiple ampersands to specify multiple but all lines must have number of alignment is a math lets you put normal a math there commands to within a math	
 justifications to do with new platforms are usually to do with five support through and how well proven something with existing key systems and open platforms tend to mop the floor with the first three but that does depend on a staff cheap but if already got little concern from open source is a little more sketchy but still the key difference is that ms owns the entire aspnet from through to support is centralised that mean good your linux server software blows you might be able to get support from your main but they might push you out to the no judgement on the quality of the but a slightly more intricate is the silliest of the django is well how you use it that tested or of course there are using svn releases of django will probably result in the occasional the biggest issue and blocker for migrating is existing aspnet sites run on linux but you can deploy django on if you have key infrastructure to move you might have to stage even deploy django on iis for a until you can chuck windows out the standards are something relative new to management basically not finding yourself locked in five years down the of course the linux platform is great on that front but it is important to note that with any orm mapper the biz that manages your there is a certain lack of you can still access the data from other places but need to concentrate on might work almost no support short and really a subjective how much of a pain migrating is really depends on your existing if you have no existing setup to migrate things are if you have the technical wager most people would swing towards a more open a personal i moved to ubuntu before i dropped i tried to keep it going through vmware but eventually decided i needed something was before the aspnet mvc framework was and eventually landed with think go back out of even to an improved aspnet django is just cleaner my humblest of freelance so i can mostly suggest what frameworks to this has been great for learning django but if you find yourself working for one you might find this if looking for going to find a damned lot fewer jobs for django than you will i doubt ever reverse but there django work out

 key parameters of the api you cited are the picture the and the the tag can be either the user id of a facebook or it can be text the case when the tagged subject is not a facebook facebook uses just one coordinate because it uses regions to denote a tagged the idea is that you click on the center of a and facebook just stores that you display a picture in a control the obvious first after you can detect mouse clicks with the and event is but tell you the once acquired a prompt for a label to accompany that you can use predetermined like user or just use ordinary or use something of your own the question of what you use to represent a tag value is orthogonal to whatever other questions asked so other half of photo tagging is that moving the mouse over the image displays the tag text over the and moving the mouse over the labels below highlight the associated handle events and write some code to display or hide labels and shapes as if you use and you might not even have to modify the but showing those controls on top of the image might interfere with further events for the it take too long to try some experiments and see what works for

 know how authoritative this is but i found it seem good to have a lot of connections to this seems to be bad for the web and most applications that have more than a few having a hard time thinking of what sqlite would be used for when you need that many every program i can think of needs lots of them so what would i use a database for that allow that many i thought about prototypes but why would i use that when i can just connect to a larger embedded apps thanks i look at the page recommended below but an confused about appropriate uses for sqlite it where sqlite works usually will work great as the database engine for low to medium traffic websites is to of all the amount of web traffic that sqlite can handle of on how heavily the website uses its generally any site that gets fewer than 100k should work fine with the 100k figure is a conservative not a hard upper sqlite has been demonstrated to work with 10 times that amount of where another rdbms may work you have many client programs accessing a common database over a you should consider using a database engine instead of sqlite will work over a network but because of the latency associated with most network performance will not be the file locking logic of many network filesystems implementation contains bugs both unix and if file locking does not work like it it might be possible for two or more client programs to modify the same part of the same database at the same resulting in database because this problem results from bugs in the underlying filesystem there is nothing sqlite can do to prevent good rule of thumb is that you should avoid using sqlite in situations where the same database will be accessed simultaneously from many computers over a network going to show my ignorance here but what is the difference between these is sqlite used

 know i have seen recommendations for installing ssrs 2005 and it stated that you should separate ssrs from the db engine that hosts the data sources for your that you should not install them on the same there any documentation for ssrs 2008 that provides practices for i am assuming that the same holds true for ssrs 2008 as it did for ssrs 2005 but have not seen it specifically stated have a project that will utilize ssrs 2008 and there is a difference of opinion on where to install on own dedicated server or on the same sql server as the report data if there is a link to any documentation that could be provided it would be gratefully all i am finding besides what is in bol refers to in 2008 installation

 know it is but in code reviews provide little value to begin there are few errors found almost never if you have competent most code reviews end with trivial action items and fix any unless you count grammar as a big more important review is did you test the what tests were did the developer do a sufficient level of that is where you will find out if the code works or is not that having peer reviews is a bad but the realities end up getting in the the main reality is that software is usually hard to understand and when it hard to understand then the problem it is solving is hard to while some companies have easier in the places i have worked it would frequently take a day or more just to understand the problem and requirements the code is solving before even being able to begin to dive into the code to understand if the code works if you understand the how can you find errors in the most people have the luxury of 1 days to properly review someone that there are some where code reviews are productive even at a rudimentary single most important reason for code reviews is that it forces any developer with pride in their work to make sure their code is of good enough quality that they would be willing to show it to other original developer in lead developer knows what they is having someone do the coding for code is either simple to grasp or a variation on a theme that is common at the in answer to your i would say

 know that a custom jvm can behave a little and trying to see if my observed behavior is the same as the real looking for some way to consistently make this stuff worst part been seeing is that exceptions are being completely eaten by the for extends remote seen two responses in my code to passing in null for one is that it logs nothing just that other is it logs nothing at code execution just and nothing after this code is run if there is a around the calling after the the calling thread never seems to continue bugs like this amazingly hard to track i throw a around this method and log the it works working on an older jvm with custom so i expect much but has anyone seen behavior like maybe in an old is it supposed to throw the exception over the or is it supposed to print a stack trace on the remote wrapping the exception in a remoteexception and rethrowing it a reasonable from spec a new is so far out of the realm of possibility that it even handling in a custom

 know this is normally rather but shoot me before reading the i promise i have a good reason for needing to do this possible to modify regular private fields in java using however java throws a security exception when trying to do the same for assume this is strictly but figured ask anyway just in case someone had figured out a hack to do just say i have an external library with a class class someclass private static final someclass instance new public static someclass return public object do some stuff here essentially want to someclass so that i can execute my own version of since there my any way to really do that in my only solution here is to alter the value of so it returns my version of the class with the modified i just want to wrap the call with a security check and then call the original external library always uses to get an instance of this class a just to is called by the external not my so just subclassing solve the i do that the only other solution i can think of is to entire class and modify the this ideal as have to keep my fork up to date with changes to the if someone has something a little more maintainable open to there any way to modify the value of a static field in java from outside the i need to monkey patch an external

 language spec performing overload a method with a parameter may be applicable either in its normal form passing an its expanded form passing a variable number of expanded form of a method is available only if the normal form of method is not available and only if a method with the same as the expanded form is not already declared in the same a if overload resolution is the compiler chooses the guess the reasons for that decision of making code like yours your method has the void you want to have some way to call the passing an so the compiler has to handle ambiguous cases a temporary array is a lot more expensive than a method so you might want to create overloads with parameters that behave the same but are more	
 languages are very closly related to the hardware architecture of the target a large extent there is a one to one mapping from asm code to machine instruction thats the whole point really so you can manipulate the hardware at the level of individual also allow you to access and manipulate memory in a manner that matches the machines memory architecture virtual vary greatly some do litle more than translate three letter codes to 4 byte like the venerable assembly language are sophisticated programming nevironments in thier own said all this most modern chips are emulating ancient instruction sets so you are really not that close to the wire the better c compilers are aware of the underlying like how many integer instructions ar e executed every cycle so a good c compiler will nearly always out perform mediocre assembly	
 languages start with array index except if you specify explicitly to start at 1 for do not believe there is a way to enforce this array convention outside of vb and as when they go through windows remoting or web services they are reverted back to the index the sake of your i recommend that you refactor all your code to use collections and arrays on your comments you said that you used the the object uses 1 as its start use an arraylist or better yet a generic list object

 linker and compiler know about that you telling it of up to the designer of the abi of your platform to specify they allocate objects at those there is sometimes platform i worked on had a range in the virtual address space that is mapped directly to physical addresses and another range that can be used by user space processes to grow the stack or to allocate heap can use the defsym option with gnu ld to allocate some symbol at a fixed if the expression is more complicated than simple use a custom linker that is the place where you can define regions of memory and tell the linker what regions should be given to what see for an though that is usually exactly the job of the writer of the you they take the spec of the abi and then write linker scripts and that fulfill the requirements of your gcc has an that you can use to place your struct into a specific you could then tell the linker to place that section into the region where your registers regs	
 linker handles the placement of data and it knows about your target system through a linker the linker script defines regions in a such as constant data and and your global variables and the and also creates a correlation between a virtual and physical address one is it is the job of the linker maintainer to make sure that the sections usable by the linker do not override your io	
 linker would typically use a linker script to determine where variables would be this is called the section and of course should point to a ram therefore it is impossible for a variable to be allocated at an address not in can read more about linker scripts in gcc

 linq on a pipes and filters is a api meaning that data is lazily returns as you ask for it iterator rather than loading everything at and returning a big buffer of means that your qry from row in source where select new qry new you enumerate over it will consume the data you can see this graphically with jon the only things that break the pipe are things that force for high volume jon and myself worked on for doing aggregates without buffering in such by most orm tools entity is a slightly different because the database engine is going to do most of the heavy the chances are that most of the steps are already done all that is left is to consume an and project this to but that is still typically a pipe implements unless you call regard to use in is that it is fine to use to write composable queries inside the but they the repository as that would make the internal operation of the repository subject to the so you would be unable to properly unit test profile optimize taken to doing clever things in the but return this also means my repository stays unaware of the is a shame as the temptation to from a repository method is quite for this would allow the caller to add but remember that they actually consumed the data this makes resource management a in mvc etc need to ensure that the calls or so that it the view that is controlling data access you unit test the controller use of filters in the dal would be things string ctx new qry qry qry return added filters but nothing happens until we call at this the data is obtained and returned the in the this can be fully unit if we did something similar but just returned the caller might do something var custs all of a sudden our dal starts failing translate to you can still do a of interesting things in the only pain point here is that it might push you to have a few overloads to support different calling patterns until i find the best answer here is to use extension methods on the that i only need one concrete repository customerrepository public string string icustomerrepository string string class customerrepositoryextensions public static this icustomerrepository string string return we have virtual overloads extension on so our caller can use without having to specify the without using pipes and filters becomes a lot more be writing some kind of text based query you can obviously append but it very the is a bit better but not as elegant as

 low level can be explored with a disassembler but the short answer is that a bunch of where the predicate depends on the instance of check followed by fetching the two arguments and assigning to two variables l and r but see below about custom extractors equality foo instance of x assignment to a fresh do this is the tail else on the much more that you can do with patterns like or patterns and combinations like but generally those are just logical extensions of what i just patterns can also have which are additional constraints on the there are also cases where the compiler can optimize pattern when some overlap between cases it might coalesce things a advanced patterns and optimization are an active area of work in the so be surprised if the byte code improves substantially over these basic rules in current and future versions of addition to all you can write your own custom extractors in addition to or instead of the default ones scala uses for case if you then the cost of the pattern match is the cost of whatever the extractor a good overview is found in	
 lower level why are you doing approach is widely used in java but hardly ever used in and is not a preferred approach you simply do not need it as libraries will not throw exceptions the way java library calls and if you are writing your own libraries you should not expect callers will naturally think to look for exceptions to convention most widely used and understood is that of a delegate that has an error method or perhaps notifications for more general failures that you need to pass up through multiple levels of that approach might be more widely used in the java world if there were a simple notification system the way cocoa has it set delegate approach has the same documenting property as declaring an exception in java they are just different approaches but generally better to use an approach more suited to the language at hand unless a very compelling reason to do

 made some changes and commited them version and found out that they introduced new bugs to my program some minutes so i switched to some of the files to an older version to get some of the files back to version 1 on my local since then i have made a lot of changes i want to and i have used commit to get my local changes on the version i have locally is exactly what i want to be on the repository as head even though some of the files are still officially on i assume i should be using svn merge in some but not really sure how to do any when i use it shows changes from the local version to the rep i could do but then i would have a version locally so what i want is some kind of forced that just says is the newest when doing svn reports that there are no thanks to neil butterworth for the what i finally i should just have used but i was dumb enough to do an update without really thinking about what i was of everything was then really messed up beyond so what i finally did was to export the project to a new obviously not the way you should do but i did not want to mess with this stuff any in the end i had to get back to making actual progress on the actual i know that i do stuff like that when working in a bigger but to force your local version as newest on	
 made this more browser friendly html public xhtml body 0 20px 0 div 0 1px solid the 90s we saw the rise of guis i know macs were around in the 80s but guis became the standard for everyone once windows took this transition had many casualties like lotus was basically killed by excel on and wordperfect word killed now you can argue that ms had the inside track since they also produced windows and be right but beyond that i think ms adjusted to the change quicker than anyone was still an agile little company back it adjusted and took its highly successful turbo pascal and created chapter 7 for further truly compiled languages ruled the roost in the 1990s with the exception of one little which was something basically it was sorta sorta interpreted compiled into bytecode that ran on a virtual i personally think that the rise of both java and netscape scared the absolute bejesus out of microsoft in the late chapter 9 for further adjusted reasonably well producing what was really the first really successful java ide in were fending off a resurgent microsoft who also produced successive versions of visual studio that were years ahead of their time in the late i can remember coding visual with mts transaction dcom objects over 10 years ago and that was a precursor to the modern application server platform we have remote debugging and the like were things that were at least light years ahead on visual in response to the text selection i tried it with absolute which you can do by changing this it still selects the only way i see around this is to change your page into a column format where the side notes are in other the only problem with this is that you lose the ability to move the notes in relation to the or at least i think of a way around

 main difference as i understand is that in debug mode the whole symbol information which is used by the debugger is stored along with the so that if a developer wants to debug the application before releasing he may do by attaching to any you noticed the files in the debug also the size of the executable is fairly however in release the debugger symbol information is omitted assuming that the end user is going to use the application so he must not be provided with the application can think of the symbols as the information proivided to the debugger to understand what local what where breakpoints are set and all sorts of information so that it can precisely tell you what part of code is being executed

 main reason being that when you use the you never know about the just the interface and an abstract method has that as the method is abstract it has no details since they must be defined by the derived the main point that makes this possible is that the and never change as the method is abstract in the base therefore the interface is just not the of it like someone selling basic airline tickets from point a to b not knowing what airline was going to be they have no idea how you will get there yet but once they hand off the contract of the sold ticket to an that airline will figure out the details of meeting the contracts all you cared about when buying the ticket was that you knew for x dollars you were going to get from a to	
 main sources of memory leaks i can think of references to objects you need any more in some sort of so here you need to remember that all things that you add to a collection that you have reference too will stay in circular having delegates registered with an so even though you explicitly reference an it get garbage collected because one of its methods is registered as a delegate with an in these cases you need to remember to remove the delegate before discarding the with native code and failing to free even if you use managed wrappers that implement often the clr clean them fast because it understand the memory you should use the

 me take a crack at first written some on this subject in an orm or plain specifically to address your of is about if you know sql the learning curve for ibatis is ibatis does some things on top of sql such still need to learn but the biggest hurdle is includes on the other hand tries to distance itself from sql and present things in an object rather than a relational as joel points out are and jpa is no to do jpa still need to know about relational performance tuning of queries and so ibatis will simply having you apply the sql you know or are jpa will require you to know something how to configure it xml or by this i mean figuring out that foreign key relationships are a relationship or of some the type you know sql i would say the barrier to learning jpa is actually if you more of a mixed result with jpa allowing you to effectively defer learning sql for a time it put it off jpa once you setup your entities and their relationships then other developers can simply use them and need to learn everything about configuring this could be an advantage but a developer will still need to know about entity transaction managed vs unmanaged objects and so worth noting that jpa also has its own query language which you will need to learn whether or not you know you will find situations where just do things that sql is a hard one to personally i think more productive in ibatis but also really comfortable with some will argue way more productive with hibernate but this is possibly least in unfamiliarity with the productivity with jpa is deceptive because you will occasionally come across a problem with your data model or queries that takes you a half a day to a day to solve as you turn up logging and watch what sql your jpa provider is producing and then working out the combination of settings and calls to get it to produce something both correct and just have this kind of problem with ibatis because written the sql you test it by running the sql inside sql server management navicat for mysql or after the query is all doing is mapping inputs and i found to be more awkward than pure you need separate tools to just run a query to see the results and something more you have to i actually found this whole part of jpa rather awkward and unwieldy although some people love danger with ibatis here is proliferation meaning your dev team may just keep adding value objects and queries as they need them rather than looking for reuse whereas jpa has one entitty per table and once you have that named queries tend to go on that entity so are hard to queries can still be repeated but i think less of a potential comes at the cost of rigidity often in an application you will need bits and pieces of data from different with sql easy because you can write a single query a small number of to get all that data in one hit and put it in a custom value object just for that jpa you are moving up that logic into your business entities are basically all or now not strictly various jpa providers will allow you to partially load entities and so forth but even there talking about the same discrete if you need data from 4 tables you either need 4 entities or you need to combine the data you want into some kind of custom value object in the business or presentation other thing i like about ibatis is that all your sql is external xml some will cite this is as a disadvantage but not you can then find uses of a table column relatively easy by searching your xml with sql embedded in code where there is no sql at it can be a lot harder to you can also cut and paste sql into a database tool and run i overstate enough how many times this has been useful to me over the i think ibatis wins hands straight sql and low by its nature jpa simply be able to manage the same level of latency or now what jpa has going for it is that latency and throughput are only rarely high performance systems however do exist and will tend to disfavour more heavyweight solutions like with ibatis you can write a query that returns exactly the data you want with the exact columns that you fundamentally no way jpa can beat even that when returning discrete of think this one is a win for ibatis like i mentioned with jpa you will sometimes spend half a day getting a query or entity produce the sql you want or diagnosing a problem where a transaction fails because the entity manager tried to persist an unmanaged object could be part of a batch job where committed a lot of work so it might be nontrivial to of them will fail if you try to use a table or column that which is you mention portability as one of your requirements moving between database worth noting that here jpa has the the annotations are less portable hibernate xml standard jpa annotations have an equivalent for id but both of them are more portable than ibatis seen jpa hibernate used as a form of portable meaning you run a small java program that creates the database schema from jpa with ibatis need a script for each supported downside of portability is that jpa in some lowest common meaning the supported behaviour is largely the common supported behaviour across a wide range of database if you want to use oracle analytics in no in a

 method exists primarily for testing for the existence of a file when you do not intend to open the for example testing for the existence of a locking file whose very existence tells you something but whose contents are you are going to open the file then you will need to handle any exception regardless of the results of any prior calls to in there is no real value in calling it in these just use the appropriate filemode enumeration value in your open method and handle any as simple as even though this is couched in terms of the it is based on the underlying system both windows and unix have system calls that use the equivalent of the filemode in fact in the filemode value is just passed through to the underlying system

 moved to delphi 2007 in early it took a long time to migrate all my tools and and not in a hurry to do that i moved from delphi but use it due to the migration msdn f1 help continues to drive me nuts pretty i access the d6 help and individual vendor help files as but it sure nearly as useful as the old click f1 you get something useful of the older help especially with all vendor files integrated appears i may be very late to the but apparently i alone in this see now that embarcadero lets you download chm files for delphi is their any way to fully integrate and get rid of that useless msdn monstrosity 2007 help

 mr potato head states that the use of md5 instead of makes generating rainbow tables have thought that once your rainbow table is generated that the algorithm used is it would make no difference to how you use the rainbow table to check for known and is there any way to know what hashing algorithm was used any think that proper hashing of your password tables is not to protect your but to protect everyone else where users will passwords and the hash algorithm used for password hashing affect rainbow table

 msdn article 6 improving it says the asynchronous calls unless you have additional parallel asynchronous calls from your web application only when your application has additional parallel work to perform while it waits for the completion of the asynchronous and the work performed by the asynchronous call is not cpu the asynchronous calls use a worker thread from the thread in you are using additional the same time that you make asynchronous such as calling a web method or performing file the thread that makes the call is released so that it can perform additional such as making other asynchronous calls or performing other parallel you can then wait for completion of all of those making several asynchronous calls that are not cpu bound and then letting them run simultaneously can improve is confusing to my understanding was that when you make an asynchronous call that no thread is used while but that an iocp is set with a reference to your callback is it true that you should only use async calls when you have parallel my understanding was that for an web it is often a good idea to change a webmethod to when you will be calling an bound operation and implement the whole thing someone help me understand what is meant by calls use a worker thread from the thread in you are using additional and the difference between workerthreads and implement an webmethod asynchronously if you can

 my and depending on your a one on one translation is not really the right approach to go consider why you want to move to and evaluate whether you really want to commit to a powerful but quite a steep learning curve and to be really worth it you need to take the time to look at the user experience and see how wpf can if you want to have the winforms look and and just move to wpf because the next new in for an unpleasant what done while migrating our winforms stuff is to make new screens in and keep hosting the old winforms screen using and these work really well by the way we had any problems with them so we then migrated screen by screen to looked like a frankenstein in the mean but at least we had regular feedback and everything was

 my problem is as building a simple calendar module for my intranet we use google for your calendar and like to give the employees the ability to see all the feeds subscribed to in one like on the real google reason not just using the the gadget they provide is because like a single week their gadget currently only offers full month and like a that basically just looks like one row from the full made such an now we just need to populate can get it to work with one i can even get it to work with all the feeds a user has subscribed the problems is that from what i can tell the only way i can get all the events from every feed that a person is subscribed to is to loop through their list of feeds and make a new call to google asking for the events each if a person is subscribed 12 going take a long idea that could help with the speed problem is to store the results in our database and update it occasionally for each of our of that will probably slow our servers down because it basically will be constantly querying google due to the number of feeds and time it takes to retrieve each there a way to ask for all the events from a list of feeds instead of querying individually for each any help would be greatly the using php and the zend gdata standalone in multiple event feeds with one gdata calendar

 my the greatest danger a team runs from measuring code coverage is that it rewards large and penalizes small if you have the choice between writing a single test that covers a large portion of your and writing ten small tests which test a single only measuring code coverage implies that you should write the large writing the set of 10 small tests will give you much less brittle and will test your application much more thoroughly than the one large test by measuring code particularly in an organization with still evolving testing you can often set up the wrong

 my the primary value of stored procedures has been eliminated with for a long the key value of using stored procedures was to encapsulate the sql in a form where you would naturally use parameterized this provided a layer of security to the developer with respect to sql since linqtosql queries by parameterized i find that my use of stored procedures has been reduced not to say that there still a place for but now i feel that you should only use them when they provide significant value over a parameterized linq query in terms of less complexity or increased perhaps because of the ability to optimize for the removing over dependence on stored i results in a more maintainable code base as most of the code is located in your ide instead of being split between your database and your that you can still use stored procedures with i just find much value in doing i think of a single stored procedure that written since switching to though i have written a few functions to perform specific these get dropped onto my datacontext and appear as methods that i can invoke to get the appropriate entities from the db using the

 my we also use i installed but had already used and it really offers many great refactoring and supporting renaming methods and reordering i really like is that according to your corporate code you can configure resharper to give you hints on style violations in different severity levels quickly apply according like ms but much easier to configure and more absolute favorite feature is by entering only the you type tshwlov and resharper will know that you mean the class from some referenced library named year i have tried the devexpress after i was quite impressed by the things that oliver sturm did with it on basta spring interface catchier and more impressive than there are huge arrows flipping around your ide and things like though the core functionality is rather had the feeling that coderush is more focussed on code creation than on more shortcuts for tasks like creating variables favorite feature there was a which always shows you all available in your current this makes you learn those commands where in resharper you have to look up most of them in nested suites are really powerful and it after months of using them you will probably still discover new which you have always needed without knowing i decided in favor of resharper mostly because of i was more familiar with it and devexpress was using much resources on my notebook and occasionally even slowed it by i use a much more powerful machine maybe i will give it another try

 my which is javascript and jquery but also uses master pages and ajax i am consistently seeing on the status bar of ie 6 occasionally ie the message items or items followed by this message never goes away and may or may not prevent some page functionality from running certainly seems to bog but not can cause this to happen of the time by just refreshing an but the number of items the file it mentions usually it is or googled for answers and there are several suggestions or some of them worked for and others practical for us to implement or are some of the caching images so it repeatedly asks for the same image if the image is repeated on the page and the server assumes that it should be cached locally since already served it in that page ie displays the images but sits and waits for a server response that never typically the file it says it is waiting on is repeated on the page is using png graphics with indeed it but they are themeroller generated graphics according to the are ie the components are the only things using all of our png references are in if that changed some of the graphics from png to but it is just as likely to say waiting for as it is for are being specified in css javascript but are on things that currently being displayed none items for this be but if it then i would think preloading images would but so adding a preloader do any caching policy is confusing the if this is it is only microsoft server sw having problems with browser surprise me at i have much control over the iis configuration that will be hosting the anyone seen this and found a way to combat particularly on apps with jquery and other data on at least one of the just commenting out the datepicker component setup causes the problem to go but i think at least not if that fixes all of the if it does have to swap out because that functionality needs to be there seem to be any open issues against on checked the iis settings and content was set on any of my unchecking that setting was a common suggestion for fixing this have page that i can consistently create the error using the file also tried with the same the problem only occurs when i refresh the page that contains the if i comment out the datepicker the problem goes here are a few things i notice when i do page always says item downloading picture but only when i look at http i see that it requests that image from the server every time it is dynamically turned without regard to of the requests for that graphic are complete and return the graphic none are marked code 200 or 304 that the server is telling ie to use the cached why it says waiting on that graphic when all of the requests have completed i have no is a single other graphic on the page of the ui png that has a code 304 on another page where i managed to log http traffic with items two different graphic files ui had a 304 as well neither was the one listed as error is not innocuous the page is not fully for if i click on one of the buttons which should execute a the page away from the page and coming back does not produce the have moved the script and script references to the bottom of the content and this affect this the script is still running in the though too hairy to divide out unless i absolutely have update and were a lot of good answers and suggestions but none of them were exactly our the closest one the one that led me to the was the one about long running so i awarded the bounty there guess i could have answered it but rather reward info that leads to was our we had multiple jqueryui datepickers that were created on the event in script included from the master on this client a local event had script that destroyed the datepickers under certain we had to use because the previous version of datepicker had a problem with when we upgraded to the latest version of jquery ui and replaced the with for the the problem went away mostly went away if you do things too fast while the page is it is still possible to get the items theory as to what was happening goes like page content loads and has 12 text boxes with the master page script on those text queues up requests for graphic ie know how cache dynamic the requests get client area script datepickers so the no longer is left with some number requests that it what to do have ideas for solving the items problem on internet

 necesarily mean bad many people find it easy and useful to use side effects to solve a the key is first knowing how to do it in a pure so know when impurity is appropriate have the concept of purity in the type so a method that takes in arbitrary delegates can always be depending on how for aka would usually be considered a pure since it modify its arguments or modify global nothing stopping you from putting such code inside the argument to for return definately an impure usage of enumerables can do whatever they want as they your code using a foreach loop is just as still modifying the source i write code like that all the chain together some then execute a foreach on it to invoke some cleaner and it has no addrange method for some if i want to add a bunch of things to what do i x in prefer the second at a i see how it can be construed as being worse than the first is it bad when it does side effecting code in a place not this is the case for my first example using and even there are times when the scope is very limited and the usage is written code that does things like to avoid i would give it another the main confusion is this immediately evaluated or foreach implies that go execute a loop right but something returning an ienumerable implies that the items will be processed as so suggest giving it another name something like and making it static x in yield return

 no way to get a single sequential series without it matter what mechanism using to assign the next value a performance a static whatever when two threads both need the next value at the same one has to wait on the first thing do is write a test program that spawned a large number of threads which each repeatedly called a locking increment function such as the one daniel schaffer that will let you find the threshold where your application starts to thrash where spending more time waiting on than doing anything that turns out to be a problem and bet that if the volumes talking about are it will then you should make each thread maintain its own sequential which you can do by marking the counter field with the you can then generate unique identifiers off of a combination of the id and the approach work if not using a thread pool the counter dies when the thread it belongs to and you probably also want to make the startup count part of the compound so that you have to write the thread counters to durable you do when you restarted the server the threads would start generating counters at zero and if your application created a thread with the same id as an earlier get duplicate is obviously not trivial to write more so definitely recommend proving that necessary

 not afraid of using you can make your function a template and use sfinae to check for the two typename will create a method for every type that extends both feature interfaces that the sfinae trick is not needed for it to an unconstrained template would but just fail to compile when you pass a type that meet the possibility is to create an interface ifeaturexy extending and use this in the function this has the drawback that types that implement both but not this joint interface would not be usable with this you can pass two arguments to the one per and require they are pointers to the same this is but could be hardened by making some template class to hold the two pointers which would be initialized by the single object in question and which would hold the two you could probably do the same thing with bounded type variables they allow multiple not sure

 not but the problem could be related to the list instance the element manifest of the feature you can define the attribute which have to point to the feature which contains the list definition to use when the list instance is here a two possible sources of this featureid the feature assumes that the list definition is defined within the same feature instance if you have two separated features for the definition and the instance this might lead to this i already said the featureid has to be the guid of the feature defining the list definition to perhaps you replaced this guid with a newly generated assuming that this not the featureid of the list definition but the identifier for the list instance itself when it is created within never had this problem so i could only guess what the reason for your error might this might help you on your further

 not familiar with google protocol but my interpretation of the documentation if the value cannot be if the value is pretty much as likely to be negative as not some fuzzy definition of likely to if the value could be but much less likely than the value being positive if the application sometimes uses to indicate an error or value and this is a relatively uncommon what the docs have to say about the encodings is an important difference between the signed int types and and the int types and when it comes to encoding negative if you use or as the type for a negative the resulting is always ten bytes long it treated like a very large unsigned if you use one of the signed the resulting uses zigzag which is much more encoding maps signed integers to unsigned integers so that numbers with a small absolute value have a small encoded value it does this in a way that back and forth through the positive and negative so that is encoded as 1 is encoded as is encoded as and so it looks like even if your use of negative numbers is as long as the magnitude of the numbers passing in the protocol is on the smaller you might be better off using if profiling would be in

 not gonna be you have any valid like the maximum number of columns that is allowed or anything like you do say you have n column you might be able to do something by a class that exposes that map the the array for one line at a list of that instance for each the correct number on the binding to property your datagrid to that kind of but it would you do not have to rely on the there is a possibility using a a uniformgrid is a panel that layouts its children in a regular grid item has the same every item has the same you can indicate the number of columns at and the panel will fit children one after the other up to the number of columns and then continue on another could bind an itemscontrol to your indicating it should use a uniformgrid as its layout panel and indicating a suitable itemtemplate to render each second option is much but you will not have the capabilities of the datagrid like moving row edition events per row

 not possible to what robert rossney just but benefit of international standards is when everybody follows life is all our software gets along has to be one of the most important standards we the basis of stuff like and still stuff like rss and because of clear standards that xml is able to interoperate between different we give up on little by get into a situation where a producer of xml will not be able to assume that a consumer of xml will be able to consumer their this would have a disasterous affect on the should push back very on anyone who writes code that does not process xml according to the i understand in these economic there is a reluctance to offend customers and business partners by saying but in this i think worth we would be in much worse financial shape if we had to xml for each business companies who do not understand send them the with the appropriate lines they need to stop thinking that xml is just text with angle brackets in it simply does not behave like text with angle brackets in not like an excuse for even the smallest embedded devices can have xml parser implementations in i have not yet heard a good reason for not being able to parse standard even if one afford a dom

 not quite sure what is your definition of the web if you use the mvc the controller would be place to take care of showing the right language version in the while the text itself would be in the view what i understand is what plays the role of the controller in your does bll mean only including processing logic and no communication between ui and if then probably the web ui layer would contain the localization would also say that it depends a lot on the technology you use in the for example has a localization model that you can not saying it should serve as an even on the contrary breaks separation of but i think this is an which would have very different solutions in different custom architecture as in your

 not really sure i totally understand your what i think you are trying to say is that when you drag a supposed to be binding a click event listener to the button on your portlet so that when clicked a dialog pops you are saying that when you click on that a dialog pops up for your portlets and not just the one you clicked the button inside the it may be that you are binding that wrench multiple times so that when its it will act as if its clicked more than the only recommendation i have for you is that instead of using the method use the is what i do do stuff this instead and see if it makes any do stuff that let me know and i will see if i can help you so i think i might understand your problem when that wrench gets it brings up a dialog and in that dialog you are allowed to make changes to a certain you know how to let the dialog box know what portlet it should be affecting on on that you can do something like var some of your stuff var var do stuff with for or whatever you wanted to the rest of your buttons and your

 not the number of classes that is important but the in my opinion you should have one conceptual entity in a in some cases this might be just a few classes in other several packages with 100s of it important is that you separate the api and the one bundle contains the api of your concept and the other the like this you can provide different implementations for a well defined in some cases this might be even necessary if you want to access the services from a bundle remotely api bundles are then used by code sharing and the services from the implementation bundles by service best way to explore those possibilities is to look at the

 noticed this in a server when making a lot of tiny objects that quickly get thrown the garbage collector keep the problem is more pronounced when the tiny objects have pointers to larger objects an object that points to a large the gc seem to realize that if it frees up the tiny it can then free the larger even when calling this was still a huge problem in and we ended up doing and what i recommend to you is to maintain a pool of when your object is no longer throw it into the when you need a new grab one from the pool or allocate a new one if the pool is this will also save a small amount of time over pure allocation because java have to clear the worried about the pool getting too large thus wasting you can either remove an arbitrary number of objects from the pool on a regular or use weak references using one of the advantages of using a pool is that you can track the allocation frequency and and you can adjust things using pools of and and we maintain separate of sizes in the pool we always allocate arrays of size that are powers of our product does a lot of string and using pools showed significant performance in the gc does a fine we just noticed that with small objects that point to larger the gc seem to clean up the objects fast enough especially when the vm is under cpu is just a hint to help schedule the finalizer thread to do more calling it too frequently causes a significant performance

 null works if the variable is actually if the variable is the empty string or an empty evaluates to this is somewhat so i would always suggest using returns true for empty empty boolean or so do use if you are sure you only want to do something if the variable is empty is generally better to check whether about to call a class method on something oh sometimes retrieving null from a database gives you the string which is not the same as an actual null it depends on the db using and how you saved the value to the database in the first this is very easy to miss and can take forever to figure try your subcat variable to see if it is string or literally a null this could account for unexpected behavior in your other code segment you mentioned in the	
 nulls are a a few ways to handle some of these are specific be real explicit about all the is null and is not is not null and is is null and is not is not null and is us a function to change the null into something that you know this first option is better because it is more second one has the of matching a null to a if you want to set them ahead of just it is it will set it to if it will leave it i think its cleaner to do it inside the per my method

 of much gratitude to for their very informative blog post scrolling in tweetie with the post explains in detail how the developers were able to squeeze as much scrolling performance as possible out of the uitableviews in with the source code linked from the blog post github a uitableview using these custom cells to switch to edit exposing the ui for deleting an item from the the text aside as the deletion control slides in from the this is although the text jumps back and forth without animation to the text movement in goal 2 above for a smooth user this is the step where i became is the best way to introduce this animation to complete goal it would be nice if this could be done in a manner that keeps the logic from my because i would love the option to move the conflicting part of the view while any portions as stay in the same place or move a different number of if the above is not possible then undoing my last commit and replacing it with an option that slides the entire view to the right would be a workable solution appreciate any help anyone can from quick pointers and ideas all the way to code snippets or github of course you are welcome to fork if you would i will be staying involved with this question to make sure any successful resolution is committed to github and fully documented thanks very much for your have been thinking about this a lot since my first post and realized that moving some text items relative to others in the view could undo some of the original performance goals solved in the original blog so at this point i am thinking a solution where the entire single subview is animated to its new postion may be the best if it is done in this way there may be an instance where the subview has a custom color or gradient hopefully this can be done in a way that in its normal position the background extends unseen off to the left enough so that when the view is slid to the right the custom background is still visible across the entire uitableviewcell when entering edit

 of my favorite features about python is that you can write configuration files in python that are very simple to read and if you put a few boundaries on you can be pretty confident that will know exactly what you mean and will be perfectly capable of reconfiguring your question what exactly are those my own personal heuristic flow no or those be in a text config file and people expecting to have understand in it probably matter the order in which your statements to literal methods and functions called on objects are harder to think anything implicit is going to be a if something complicated that has to happen with your change how keywords and error handling are right guess i ask this because i came across a situation with my django config file where it seems to be useful to break these i happen to like but i feel a little my project is deployed through svn checkouts to a couple different servers that all be configured the same will share a some for i throw a hook at the from import localized localized is on the python path but outside the working what do you either about this or about python config boundaries in it ever polite to put code in a python configuration

 only issue with code coverage and unit tests is that unit tests only test what they were originally designed to and by are code and prone to the same functional that plagues regular are only good for what they are written and after a not high quality unit tests will obviously provide some these are my important factors for software of external data interface points of unit tests on underlying implementations such as of external implementation interface point such as of volume of code a system lives in it is exposed to a greater variety of data inputs as the dataset it has collected this by definition exposes the codebase to a greater number of edge cases and can be mitigated by the quality of the data error and unit also the moving targets of the underlying environment that the system operates one way to moderate this is to put the application in a the system implements i could see the codebase facing a greater chance of failure as more plugins are code elegant if probably going with the simple point here that the more code there the less likely it is that it is well but i suppose it could be turned my codequality would probably involve the metric of what the code coverage in the unit tests you could run a static analysis program against it to determine potential bugs and that would probably be some help as i at some really hard to score because code should be weighted a lot heavier than a and refactoring ought to be figured but only where there are evidences of software the a my contribution to

 only safe way to deal with this is to ensure that you do not have a loss of conversion at the assert code will only work during debug builds and will allow for a conversion loss in retail the conversion loss is bad because it will pass around a completely incorrect size for the you really need is a mechanism to prevent you from creating data i reccomend using a class like this will prevent a conversion which overflows or underflows by means of throwing an size throws if size fit in an unsigned

 only way to make the initial compilation of the query faster that i know of is to make the query less the msdn documentation on considerations for the entity and indicate that there is any way to save a compiled query for use in a different application execution would add that we have found that having lots of includes can make query execution slower than having fewer includes and doing more loads on related entities some trial and error is required to find the right i have to ask if you really need every property of every entity you are including it seems to me that there is a large number of different entity types in this so materializing them could well be quite if you are just trying to get tabular results which you intend to projecting the fewer number of fields that you actually need into a anonymous type should be significantly faster for various this frees you from having to worry about eager calling can certainly speed up the initial view generation by precompiling the entity there is on msdn for but since you pay that cost at the time the first query is your test with a simple query shows that this is running in the neighborhood of 2 seconds for nice to say that 2 but it save anything

 optimiser will make its decision based on the relative cost of the full table scan and using the this mainly comes down to how many blocks will have to be read to satisfy the the rule of thumb mentioned in another answer is in some cases a full table scan will make sense even to get of the rows if those rows happen to be spread around many consider this create table t1 as select from alter table t1 modify update t1 set 2 where 3 rows analyze table t1 compute select from t1 where is not 861 you can only approximately of the rows in t1 have a but due to the way i built the these 861 rows will be spread more or less evenly around the the from t1 where is not likely to visit almost every block in t1 to get even if the optimiser used the it makes sense then to dispense with the index and go for a full table key statistic to help identify this situation is the index clustering select from where value 460 is quite high to the 861 rows in the and suggests that a full table scan will be see dbazine article on clustering	
 optimization is the root of all is a fine balance but i would say of the time you need to optimize at the there are decisions you can make early on to help prevent for example assume we are talking about an web you have a requirement to display the now you can grab all items and display 50 of or you can grab just 50 from the these type of decisions should be made up counting should only be done when a problem has been	
 optimization tricks use are generally the same tricks use for a normal just with a faster turn around some things you can look into doing get requests that have high odds of being loaded by the a caching layer in between as mitch wheat depending on your technology you can look into quite common and there are libraries for just about at denormalizing data that is going to be queried at a very high assuming that reads are more common than you should get a decent performance boost if you move the workload to the write portion of the data access opposed to adding database load via delayed inserts to give priority to writes and let the database server optimize the sure you have intelligent indexes on the table and figure out what benefit if rebuilding the indexes very frequently due to a high you may want to scale back the at retrieving data in more general queries and filtering the data when it makes to the business layer of the mysql uses a very specific query cache that matches against a specific it might make sense to pull all results for a given even if only going to be displaying look at running asynchronous queries to the database if possible within your data synchronization to be it just needs to appear that way of the common pages on in a fully formatted state so that the server have to do much processing of in there are of things you can do they generally come down to general development practices on a more bite sized	
 optimizer thinks that the full table scan will be there are just a few the optimizer is you are absolutely sure that the index access will be faster you have more than rows with is then hint your index mytable col1 is not using to retrieve values not covered by the index implies a hidden join on which costs about times as much as table the index range includes more than of the table scan is usually mentioned by clustering factor is more accurate method to measure this but is still a good rule of

 organization has only had a formal qa team for about a year and a now we are trying to get a configuration management group only have one person for this to a all the development managers wish we would get more qa people rather than configuration management because we have found that qa is extremely valuable to us and configuration management only causes projects to get farther behind while we wait for someone to put the new code out on the release schedule rather than when it is ready to developers have blind spots in testing their own code know how it is supposed to wrok after and good qa people will always find things the developers think the biggest problem with getting good qa people is the salaries tend to be on the lower there is no reason for a technical person to move to that career path if he or she is already making more than the qa people so they end up with people right out of school or who have no technical these are exactly the people who have the knowledge to set up good automated testing or the business acumen to understand how users need the software to have seen this with business analysts as well who are also critical to the quality of the final i just saw a job opening for one of these that paid 30k a sorry but the guy who is going to determine what the requirements for the software that is critical to the function of a company needs to get paid more than the and managers wonder why software quality can be so bad requirements bad software close to of the

 other ways line the registry is appropriate for many kinds of configuration by choosing a suitable place in the you can make some configuration some configuration sound like your application but mention it or any combination of the windows manages the storage of the data and provides a rudimentary way for users to edit it the registry makes it more difficult to run more than one instance of your program with different options at the same can store configuration information in a text file on this allows you to keep the configuration in the same place as the which makes it easier to find using the you have to tell the user where to configuration files can usually be edited with a regular text generally you will have to specify what format is to be used and to read and parse the text handling syntax errors if method allows you to easily run more than one instance of your each with its own separate configuration file your app looks in its own directory for the config for line program can read its configuration information from the command but you still have to store the data somewhere the command line can only support a limited amount of information before it gets program could read its configuration information from environment these might be variables that are set by a script that runs your programs you have the same problems as command line the data must still be stored somewhere or might be a globally set environment variable supplied by the windows provides very primitive tools for changing the global less accessible than even this choice is not often used on is an advanced technique that requires cooperation with some other program that the data into shared like many other the data must still be stored somewhere else in the first not recommended unless you really know you need

 others are very right to mention that you are almost certainly falling into the pit of premature when they say that trigonometric functions are not telling the whole trigonometric function implementations are actually in the value of the input this is because the trig functions are most efficiently calculated on a small interval like for the best even smaller parts of this but that one suffices to explain so the algorithm looks something like in series approximation of some or or perhaps a function requires 0 x if x x while x x return microcoded cpu instructions like the end up doing something like this so trig because they are usually take time to do the argument there are two you have to calculate a ton of values off the principal domain of the trig your math is probably not very well thought notation hides a constant argument reduction has a very small constant because simple to thus the part is going to dominate the part for just about every	
 others has you prevent the user from starting a new session without resorting to activex or other the basic problem is that there is no way for you to know whether a user closed the old browser window or left it you can do is to invalidate the previous session as soon as the user logs into a new bit similar to how may instant messaging clients each assign a new guid to the user in your also store this guid in the session cache need to ship it back and forth to the which work for get requests on each page compare the guid assigned to the user in the database with the guid in the session if they return a have logged in from somewhere i was a bit too fast on the this prevent the scenario where the user opens multiple within the same browser so you would have to combine this solution with dave anderson suggestion for storing a viewstate hash simply a so that only the last served page in a session is allowed to post you can only rely on this framework as a convenience to the user since not any half decent hacker will be able to circumvent these

 others have no single stl container can do i like neil another option would be to use both a set and a when you go to check to see if the element is in the if it you insert as that would violate your uniqueness if it add it to the set and then insert it into the this is easy to implement and can be wrapped into a single the tradeoff is increased memory but you trade that for increased computation time by doing the find yourself on the single it all depends on how much data you are working with in your problem domain and your time and memory constraints

 others have said about operator precedence seems to be but i think there is a bigger issue you really need zillions of to model this sure found out by now that this method is not trying to change anything in that pile of ifs is going to be a real pain and very error thing i would do is separate the calculation for the discount from the calculation for the this way you do not have to manually calculate every possible combination of discount and what talking double int const double const int const double the discount is 50 for each scaled so that year 1 year 2 is and so double discount year 50 this calculation assumes that speed int feemultiplier double fine feemultiplier return discount the the discount and fine are combined only one this is just figuring out what formula is used to calculate the fine and then implementing if the fine were defined in a more arbitrary manner then perhaps a table would be	
 others have suggested various changes like adding a view let me concentrate on the various criteria for a good the more abstract and loosely coupled the architecture the more extensible it this is exactly why others have recommended you use a view layer which would abstract out the presentation layer templates for each pair into its own this goes with the more extensible the architecture the more maintainable it is that with a grain of salt because it is not always the consider adding a model layer below your model logic this would help you swap out your data access logic from the model business the downside to the architecture you have posed is that you really need to invest in security since all your code is in that file has a lot of responsibility and any changes to it may result in a potential security this necessarily you just need to be aware of the your architecture is balanced and seems very since you have it broken down by you can add caching at any layer to improve adding an addition data access model layer will also help you cache at the layer closest to the experiment with each architecture and be afraid to make it already seems like you have a good understanding of the only way to get better at architecting is to implement and test it in the

 others trying both is one good but to i would base it more on which language you prefer to if a web do a lot with the but line of code you write will be in that since both frameworks are really more a matter of what language be happiest writing code day in and day personally use rails and love but have many friends using when we discuss time and it boils down more to language than the languages are fairly and typically find one you prefer a lot more than the at least in my i had originally thought python sounded learned wrote a few things with but it just never for when i first saw ruby many years ago it seemed a bit but when i revisited it via it just felt so when i write code in ruby i feel like pretty much writing english if i can think of how i think the code should be i can pretty much type that and it it just fits my brain get a lot of different i think being means nor do i think the ruby community is by any means especially compared to say the java ruby and rails have certainly gone mainstream to some and for those of us worked with it for several it seems but in the grand scheme of things actually still fairly good and looking into them and finding what will delight you to work

 parts of boost are very to use a small boost often you end up a huge amount of it is actually quite astonishing if you generate a dependency perhaps you need to support the dozen or so platforms that boost so a smaller amount of code would be easier to employer or the environment your product must work in may be certain national agencies that review your code may object to 3rd party code developed by unknown entities though the source code is clearly certain national agencies may not be comfortable with the coding standards used to develop they may want you to take ownership of that boost code and bring it up to their and coding in that case it may be far less expensive to develop your own version of the boost most likely your version will not have the usefuleness or scope of the boost code in this and may in fact take hours of painful debugging to make it but it may be just fine for your not saying i agree with the above i but the environment some of us find ourselves

 personally always use import then access everything the reason is that at the same time you have short and you clearly define the module namespace of each something that is very useful if you have to search for usage of a given module in your to do not use the import because it pollutes your namespace and it does not tell you where a given function comes from which you can run in trouble if you have the same module name for two different modules in two different import import this of course you run into but then a strong hint that your package layout is and you have to rethink

 personally would always go with the two where clauses whenever it make the statement your it probably be noticeble at but having 2 where clauses definitely will have a performance impact if you have a large and if you use all of the results from this for if you call on the or iterate through the entire the first where clause will creating a new ienumerable that will be completely enumerated with a second the 2 clauses together causes the query to form a single delegate that gets run as the collection is this results in one enumeration through the collection and one call to the delegate each time a result is you split things as your first where clause enumerates through the original the second where clause enumerates this potentially 2 full enumerations through your collection and 2 delegates called per which could mean this statement could take 2x the runtime you do decide to use 2 where placing the more restrictive clause first will help quite a since the second where clause is only run on the elements that pass the first in your this on a large it as a general rule of i go readability and this i think both options are equally so go for the more performant

 pointer is simply a variable that holds a memory you use a pointer to a when you want to hold the address of a pointer you want to return a and you are already using the return variable for you will pass in the address of a the function then dereferences this pointer so it can set the pointer the parameter of that function would be a pointer to a levels of indirection are also used for multi dimensional if you want to return a 2 dimensional you would use a triple when using them for multi dimensional arrays though be careful to cast properly as you go through each level of is an example of returning a pointer value via a a very useful but shows what i char char pinput return you call this function like char bsuccess

 possible explanation is that you could forget parts of a change the change sets that you are merging cover files that are outside the subdirectory that you have checked then there is always the possibility that you will forget to merge those if you have a commit like this on rich 16 apr 2 m m some you then have a checkout of subdir1 from your branch then you could merge the change set r5 like svn co cd svn merge 5 merging r5 into svn ci r5 from this will only merge half of revision worse if you go back and look at the it will now show svn log rich 16 apr 2 m m some it looks like merged the whole when in fact you have only merged some of of course r6 does show that only 1 file has changed on the stable rich 16 apr 1 m m revision 5 from has to or that only part of the change set got merged and the rest needs not using subdirectory merges avoids this are times when you really want to merge all of a previous and the above scenario is exactly what you intended to in that it is probably best to add a good commit message describing your

 possible try using another profiler netbeans one works this may be hard to do depending on how your code is is possible just like many other a different profiler will result in different returning a local primitive really take longer than returning calculated an instance variable takes longer than returning an local variable the getter that you have is simple so it should be so it becomes as fast as accessing a public instance variable is slower than accessing a local you have a local value meaning in the method as opposed to in the exactly do you mean by i look at metric other than base have not used the eclipse so i am not sure how it it might make a difference if it is a tracing or a sampling profiler two can give different results for things like these results misleading and i need to consider some profiling would consider another just to see if the result is the based on it is a sampling profiler what that every the program is sampled to see where the program if you are calling the one method way more than the other it will show up as being in the method that is called more is simply more likely that that method is being tracing profiler adds code to your program process known as to essentially log what is going profilers are slower but more they also require that the program be changed instrumentation which could potentially introduce bugs that i have heard of it but i am sure it does at least while they are developing the profilers are faster but less accurate just guess at how often a line of code is if eclipse uses a sampling profiler you could see what you consider to be strange changing to a tracing profiler would show more accurate eclipse uses a tracing profiler then chaning profilers should show the same result they new profiler may make it more obvious to you as to what is going

 power of power user is basically an administrator so a user to power user does not provide any increase in security to the system you might as well be on interactively as a normal of course a developer needs administrative access to their developer machine servers and second boxes and so but of course noone should interactively log on as administrator during normal development or use a normal user account for this and most seriously do not want to run any client and so as an normally log onto your linux box as root even if you likely have root access when you need a separate personal administrator the developer with a separate personal administrator account to machine account that is also a valid administrator on other servers and boxes that person needs administrative access and in uac to prompt or request prompt and enter the administrative credentials for tasks and processes only when pki with smartcards or similar can greatly reduce the strain in entering credentials is happy audit this way and an easy way to find out who is using the terminal services sessions on a particular server you have to access right definitely development work that will never require local administrator privileges like most web development where deployment is tested against a separate server or virtual machine and where cassini or whatever is used for local debugging actually runs well as a normal

 previous answer i just overwrote with sed wont sed is too weak for this sort of thing whipped up a that should do the its hopefully very my rename open my or error with open my or error with while my replace with echo echo replace ashded with print close or close error with close or close error with unlink i tested this on any real so it could go would recommend you have your code revisioned its already and run your tell me you have tests on the modified because you be its doing the right thing without a fully fledged fsm	
 previous answers are good extension methods apply nicely my first thought was that inheritance a great choice to begin since not really creating a different kind of bitmap you just want to package up some code to manipulate in other words no need to pass a class to you can just pass the modified bitmap in place of the you really were intending to override some of methods with your i would look carefully again at what trying to accomplish for something as complex as image manipulation you might be better served by supplying functionality alongside the original methods as opposed to superseding	
 previous solutions for two sets see edit history for is a way to do it recursively for an arbitrary number of static if throw new have a product of fewer than two sets return static ret new if else for obj for set return that it is impossible to keep any generic type information with the returned if you knew in advance how many sets you wanted to take the product you could define a generic tuple to hold that many elements instance but there is no way to have an arbitrary number of generic parameters in	
 primary benefit of is that you have to write any nearly glue code to get remote processes to there are a wide variety of client libraries available for many in the case that you have a rich api of can be a very easy way connect remote processes to that performing the same task with a plain post will require you to convert an api to a form and dispatch requests into api there are a few systems that can help with but it is certain to be more difficult than just exposing the api through the other if it you already have a rich api exposed through plain form encoded hard to justify the work of porting both client and server to another	
 primary development box is a windows 2003 server installation running on a vmware virtual machine that runs off a 500 gb external hard it works some works with write caching turned on or better with it you have write caching on or make sure to properly shut down the and use the eject hardware feature to stop the drive before you disconnect the hard you the it can take several minutes to finish writing all the data to the external force it or rush or have a corrupted host machine is a laptop running xp so protected from power i also have a ups that i plug the external drive into in case the power you do end up with a corrupted vm has happened as a worst case all you need to do is create a new vm and attach the same drives to always come up running fine for backup strategy should be chosen independently of whether or not on an external hard even if you have them vms can become corrupted or you can lose choose how often you need to back them up and do you should fully stop the vm and shut it down before doing the backup just suspend	
 primary question is which approach is developing an application using have this one module where i capture some data and store it in the data comes in no duplicates are to be for discussion sake we can assume a table with just one and name that column is named so if we get a keyword already in database we do not store it and we have set this column as primary key and made it query i have before i insert this new data into the shall i do a db call and check if the keyword exists or if it exists put it into something i just insert and let the database handle the effectively letting it throw an which i try catch keyword know catching an exception and not doing anything is so not looking for what is good and what is bad what i want to understand is which approach would be the in relation to javascript and sqlite but general comments are syntax used is just for illustration you may assume that i create sql execute them and fetch the or assume it is a javascript library call which does all the dirty question is a bit like this i check for db constraints in code or should i catch exceptions thrown by i want to understand the performance related differences as the application working on needs to be as fast as possible application and javascript checking for existence of data before inserting or letting sqlite throw an

 probably already read this section of docs about memory but point you to the section about the ownership just in you are only responsible for managing the memory of objects you to quote the own any object you an object using a method whose name begins with or or contains or you own an you are responsible for relinquishing ownership when you have finished with you do not own an you must not release section of those docs provide good but to put the points above in the context of your specific am i supposed to memory manage these good news you ignore the the memory management aspect of the objects in your they just created or did they always may have always or they may have just been the beauty of is that as a consumer of those have to i retain and if i release the object that created will they be released as need to retain them if just passing them on to some other or using them as intermediate values yourself in your own calculations within the for that returning the from your example function to someone no point in retaining it just to return you do happen to retain then you are responsible for issuing a corresponding release message as some you for retain the from your example if you want to hold on to that value as a property in your own uses reference if you need that object to stick around for a long you must retain it so that someone release message cause it to vanish if the retain count falls to they say you ask for a string from if has to create that string just special for you order to service your but otherwise care about that then probably put that string into the autorelease if the string was already a property of and it was just sending it to you in response to your then it probably the beauty you know and need to since created the it is responsible for managing you can ignore the memory management unless you add to the string by sending it a retain if i run a million times in a can i dispose of all those nsstrings as yours to manage because you create as a technical if really did have to create 1 million copies of to service your 1 million it probably put them all in an autorelease which would be drained at the end of the current cocoa event unless you send each of those objects a retain you can gleefully ignore the memory management question

 probably mean template method are they serve very similar would say it is better to use template method in cases when you have a algorithm having defined steps where subclasses override these steps to change some case of you need to create an and instead of inheritance you are using i would say it is a bit more powerful pattern and maybe better in accordance to dip dependency inversion it is more powerful because you clearly define a new abstraction of strategy a way of doing which does not apply to template if this abstraction makes sense use using template method may give you simpler designs in simple which is also which words fit do you have a template or is the key thing here that you have an abstraction of strategy new way of doing something of a template you inherit from application and substitute what exactly will be done on run and of a when writing a you do not inherit from an array delegates the comparison algorithm to a	
 probably need to be more specific about what you the key thing to know is that when bouncing the the angle of incidence equals the angle of in pong like they usually alter the angle based on the part of the paddle that it hit if the paddle were an using a it has a start point and a if the start point is the left side of the screen then you are in because the normal slope intercept formula works mx m is slope and b is the where it crosses the value of y when x is then increment x some amount and calculate on the return you can do this m is 0 when the vector is perfectly when it hits the to preserve angle of incidence angle of reflection you just need to use for the position on the if you have any comment on this answer or update your question and i will try to provide more

 probably not doing this in a dos batch or at support for is unheard of for me in dos could use in fact i have written a parser for a specific regular language that way but the easiest way would probably be to assign the contents of to another using if the result comes out as you need to check whether the input itself was otherwise you can conclude it was a enableextensions a equ 0 if equ 0 echo else echo not a else echo this works only for numbers in the range of if you just care for any number as then you need to resort to the approach of dissecting updated to solve the space there is still a problem entering yields since can evaluate this	
 probably not interested in participating in it the google summer of code has a of that are a project participating generally means that it wants more it has mentors who are willing to help new and it has an ideas list with tasks that are good for someone just getting started on the code base they are generally designed to be a full summer long they do range in through this list can definitely help you find things to do more easily than trawling through every open source project available on or github is nice because you can so easily hack away with as many patches and throwaway branches as you and then request that your code be merged in once its

 probably want to inherit from and override the probably also need to every time to force this will set up a simple game loop and allow you to update the screen pretty your onpaint method update the position of an object based on how much time has elapsed since the last time your onpaint method was called and which key was pressed probably do this by using a velocity as oldposition value of velocity will change based on which key you press negative for positive for also need a variable and some code to keep track of whether moving horizontally or is a pretty low performance way to accomplish this a if you want to stick with windows but get better performance without too much you might look into if you want much better performance and are willing to do significantly more look into interop with directx and the win32 api or just switch over all

 problem i have is have a table an with the following have a method called which does the int value value value i want to avoid is the following a calls method and gets the value b calls method and gets the value a increases value by 5 b increases value by 5 a saves value b saves value the record has a value of 10 when it should have been i want to force is the a calls method and gets the value b calls method but has to wait because a already called a increases the value b is still a saves the value has value of b can now read the value b increases the value b saves the the record has a value of which is the outcome looking solved this problem in the past using a static class and putting a lock on a static object created within the constructor of that thus funneling all the work through one static which forces other calls to wait in afraid however that this also think that the the highest isolation level for a transaction do the trick either because it will allow the read in step 2 of the unwanted example suppose another solution would be to create my own lock table and record the locks but that seems like it be developing this project with and sql server does the hive mind dibs on a table

 problem is likely to be that your code is running on assuming that doing this using the standard jquery method of running code on and not using the onload in any even using jquerys will be too slow if you have a lot of other javascript files to as the event fired on the document until all javascript includes have should be able to work around the issue by including your code that modifies the table just after the html for the table in your page and not running it on load make sure you wrap it in this approach to you will need to have all javascript required by the code which is modifying the table included earlier in the you have other javascript files you should try to include them later in the not sure how being inside an update panel will affect it you will need to make sure that your code is being when the updatepanel but i believe this should all happen

 problem is that using to represent the type of the this is the values are actually normal 32 bit values on should only be used for values which change size based on the 32 or 64 of the platform as change the code to use int or and this should fix your reason this works fine on win32 is that is a different sized type depending on the for 32 bit windows it will be 32 bits and on 64 bit windows it will be 64 so on 32 bit windows it just happens to match the size of the data type you are	
 problem is that you have a route that matches the route values action have two one is the empty string which matches controller action the other is your hash which matches controller action when routing goes to build a url from the route values it find one none of them have the and simplest in this is to create a direct route to the so that you can still use your put this at the top of your registerroutes order routing checks each in the order until it finds a route url with new controller action parameter you have that you really use the default since the value would be consider a valid controller if someone mvc would look for a controller called and complain that it find this means you have to manually add new routes for each new controller action i showed which is a best solution my is to use regex if your hashes have a very format 5 letters followed by 2 or followed by any or if willing to impose such a you can use the regex constraints supported by only need these two new controller action new hash regex route url with new controller action parameter these if mvc sees a controller name it will check the first find that it match the regular and move to the next my regular expression syntax may be a bit so use something like to test a regex to make sure it works with your hashes and controller that i know i wrote a but mvc is so you can do things in so many different

 problem with using a progress bar is often a process takes multiple different so if i were doing a progress dialog for a software i use a single progress but a task list with check marks so the user can see what task is being performed at the a progress bar next to the task if taking longer than 10 seconds so they can see that work is being done and they abort it too running tasks are nice because past performance strongly indicates future the first 10 seconds will likely show you how long the remainder of the file same with the update processes need a progress so even display one on any process until that one process has taken 10 seconds or that way the user on a fast system just sees a checkmark on each and on a slow system the user sees the and if it stays on a task they get the progress bar with actually useful the progress bar make any promises about how long the later tasks will an overall time at the bottom that covers best guess for all tasks is very but i show that on a progress thing about progress bars is they are meant to travel when they jump and stutter very frustrating for the user they are actually less useful and give the wrong information in that the right tool for the too many times a progress bar is chosen when actually the wrong

 purpose of a supervision tree is to manage the processes not necessarily forward there is no reason you use different code to send requests directly to members of the list of available see the or functions for one way to get those can let the pool module handle the management of the processes and killing and use some other module to transparently redirect requests to the pool of maybe you were looking for distributed pools be hard to get away from the master process in erlang whithout going to distributed the whole running system is pretty much one large supervision	
 purpose of autohosting in mono is to make it as easy as possible for someone to quickly get an site hosted on mono by reducing the amount of effort needed to configure the it does so by hosting file types which have been configured as file you can find the file extensions it is configured to host in the mvc routing avoids using file it is probably just not a good solution for mvc that if you absolutely must use you could add the following to your file to set all content for the server to be served as so has broader so i say recommend you have the ability to change the configuration for the apache you would probably get better results from just configuring for your	
 purpose of it is that the browsers have predefined properties for the has some predefined properties for its elements like the for the paragraph the point of using the reset cheat sheet is to start with default values that are equal for all elements padding i use the reset file in my project but not in its original you should decide which elements in the sheet to use and you can always assign other default values for the tags you can test your by installing most of the browsers is the latest statistics representing the usage of advice is to use mozilla as your 1st choice testing browser and every now and then test the page on other chrome and safari is a to a discussion about multiple ies on one of

 question for good i asked for a good web based ctime since jan time a 32 bit signed needed a tool where i could enter a and get the ctime i was able to find once i realized that unixtime is the other name for the google was my friend once i got how about a filetime which is more commonly used as 64 bit signed representing 100 nanosecond units since jan active directory uses internally for time there is some better keyword to search on that would find it for i have a tool that will show me the current time in and i can do the math elsewhere by but not quite what i am looking from ease of use have a function that can use it in but not a wrapper to make easily usable in a fast time formatter supports but i again am looking for a nicely wrapped version of for good filetime

 question is does not work at a it works a a volume and you will have a device path which you can using the filesystem api will automatically mount the device volume with a on a file by file or you can access the device directly by should be easy to backup all files on the snapped device volume forget all of the file streams and for ntfs your problem will be restoring vss will not help you on the the main problem will be restoring a system where you will need another os to boot to like winpe or dos or something if your not worried about system volumes then restore can be you backup the data in terms of then you get the added benefit that if you write a volume device driver for it look like a volume or then windows will a filesystem driver for this gives you a free explorer this is what most sector based backup applications also it gives them vm if you are doing simple file it helps to understand filesystems so that you know what you backup and do you know what a ntfs reparse point how are you going to deal with it if you hit one during your do you know how windows actually boots and what files you need to backup and restore and to be able to have a chance at on a how best do you lay out the ntfs volume as not to affect ntfs performance on the restored are you going to support restoring system volumes to new what does that require you to do just to have a chance of the questions are is not there are lots of edge cases some of the questions that you know about until you hit luck on you i hope i put you off too just saying there is a lot of work to be able to deliver a backup application that most people have have no idea

 question is what is a deadlock or a wrong finanical deadlocks are far worse than wrong i know that sounds but hear me the traditional example of db transactions is you update two subtracting from one and adding to that is a financial database you use business that means adding one row to each it is of upmost importance that these transactions complete and the rows are successfully the account balance temporarily wrong a big that is what the end of day reconciliation is and an overdraft from an account is far more likely to occur because two atms are being used at once than because of a uncommitted read from a sql server 2005 fixed most of the bugs that made nolock so unless you are using sql server 2000 or you need info on row level	
 question leads on to some fun diversions concerning the nature of python objects and garbage probably helpful to understand that all variables in python are really that is they are names in a namespace as a whch point to an address in memory where the object actually for the value of an uninitialized variable is the same as asking for the value of the thing a pointer points to when the pointer has not yet been created obviously nonsense which is why the most sensible thing python can do is throw a meaningful oddity of the python language is that possible that an object exists long before you execute an assignment you magically create an object nope it already since is an immutable singleton there are already a few hundred pointers to commment by jfs here to show the a 1 integers less than 256 are b 1000

 rather like to know whether there are ways to avoid a complete rewrite in one shot when migrating to to our fogbugz codebase was written in classic asp and when we wanted to offer it on the simplest solution was to write a compiler which read the asp and emitted it that and take more than a few upside was when we decided to switch our entire application to it only meant tweaking the compiler a bit to output object to get back to your asp and php are very very similar and depending on your app there are really naive translators that might get you most of the way

 real advantage of the fully normalized version in the first answer comes when the requirements change when someone changes the specs so you have to add types beyond the 3 those changes do normalized structure should let you do that more without needing to change either table structure or most of the programs that use the the normalized structure does require more investment in the beginning every new transaction involves inserting into 2 you need to have a check constraint to control the do better in the long term with the normalized with a simple case lik you can sometimes get away without normalizing and not have to pay the consequences nobody has to pay until long gone and somebody reasonable levels of normalization should be your standard strategy and you should require yourself to have very good reasons for

 realize that performance is an iterative you build a web application in a single launch and never work on it on the you start and address performance issues as your site onto identify your this is the most important you need to focus your effort where get the best you should have some sort of monitoring solution in place cacti or giving you visibility into going on on your probably find that database access is your biggest bottleneck on the back end but you should verify this on your probably find that a lot of your traffic is for a small set of you can cache those resources in something like saving yourself the database and resulting in better backend others have mentioned take a look at the ydn performance consider picking up the help you with front end and make sure configured with enough memory to hold all your compiled php we recently discovered that our apc installation have nearly enough giving it enough to work in cut our cpu time in and disk activity by sure your database tables are properly this goes hand in hand with monitoring the slow query above will get you very that is to even a fairly site should be able to survive a frontpage digg on a single server if done the eventually hit a point where the default apache config always be able to keep up with incoming when you hit this there are two things to monitor your apache activity you should have an idea of how many connections are active at any given in addition to the max number of active connections when you get sudden bursts of apache with this in this is the best guide to apache config chapter as much load off of apache as you too to serve static content you should be using a reverse proxy or webserver or to serve static and to take over the job of bytes to slow this leaves apache to do what it does execute your the book does a good job of gotten this largely an issue of caching and keeping an eye on your outgrow a single probably add more front end all backed by a single database then going to have to start spreading your database load probably by for an excellent overview of this growth see livejournal a more look at much of the check out scalable web by cal of flickr google has of the book available for

 realize that this answer your but i really understand why there need to be studies on this sort of the implications of either setup are pretty especially if ever worked in each type of a bullpen or cubicle communication between team members is going to be maximized but going to be difficult for anyone to be maintain their focus and maximizing communication in this manner is a double edged good because everyone will know going on and contribute to technical conversations they eavesdrop but bad because everyone is going to get sucked into conversations closed door people have to work harder at keeping communication channels open but much easier to maintain focus and concentration on worked in both types of i much prefer closed door a closed door office gives me the choice of whether to be involved in communication or be able to sit and setups do not give me that even with headphones i sometimes find it very difficult to concentrate when a conversation going on think the ideal setup would be to have a common area where people can do work in a shared environment if not doing anything that requires a great deal of concentration along with closed door offices for when people need to make phone calls or concentrate without i think the reality is that no company is going to pay for that extra	
 really a hard and fast rule for this type of thing most experiments like to use at least 200 members in a population at the barest scaling up to millions or the number of generations is usually in the 100 to in to answer your final better to have lots of members in the population so that genes stay in a population long enough to and then use a smaller number of these the important most critical part of any ga is the fitness if you have a decent fitness function that accurately evaluates what you consider to be a level or a not going to end up with interesting results no matter how many generations you or how big your population is

 really be storing the age within the database as it is easily calculated and changes on a daily would suggest that you keep the date of birth field and just calculate the age as you need if you wish to have the age selected along with the other attributes then consider a perhaps with a user defined function to calculate the following is an example udf that you could function age declare select from where userid return within your queries you can do something similar to the as answer to your question on sorting then you could create a view on the data and use that to show the data so something like this view as can then use this view to perform your there could be a performance hit for filtering and sorting based on the age and if you regularly based upon the age field then you may want to create an indexed

 really does the lib expose only functions where memory is either managed by straight win32 methods or the caller never frees memory allocated by the callee or do you only rely on basic libraries that changed much since vs if you should be are 2 basic things to watch changes to global variables used by and changes to the structure of etc defined by those for the crt memory allocator has probably changed its hidden allocation management structures between the 2 so having one version of the library allocate a piece of memory and having another free it will probably cause a another if you expose classes through the interface and they rely on ms runtime libraries like a chance that the class layout has changed between vs 6 and vs that means that accessing a on the class could go to the wrong thing and cause unpredictable probably hosed if the uses mfc in any mfc defines and internally uses tons of and any access to mfc globals by the operations in the could cause failures if the mfc infrastructure has changed in the hosting environment has changed a lot since vs explored exactly what changes were made in the mfc but seen unpredictable behavior between class binaries compiled in different vs top of those a risk for functions like that rely on static global variables defined in the not but concerned those static variables may not get initialized properly if you use a client expecting the crt on a thread created on the look at the documentation for for more

 really not that difficult at i had students in my design patterns class doing it for an assignment javabean getters and the following article a great article on it at 2006 there may be a few api changes writing plugins takes a little getting used but so does any you can modify the ast see the page i reference should note that the above link is from the eclipse which can also be accessed via contents inside eclipse a lot of good info in but just a starting	
 really recommend but you should be able to modify the that checks for weak keys using and the it took a while for me to load all of it up in my virtual machine and want to mess with the reflexil view tools reflexil the can use functions will come doubleclick the one found in should have come up in the instructions scroll all the way down to line 29 to this means the function will always return your assemblies pane you can now scroll up and click on language runtime the reflexil pane will give you an option to save up your original assembly is a signed assembly and you will need the sdk for reflexil to make it skip i just checked this you should already have this with visual just click it for verification skipping this when asked think i have to tell you to only use this on your development machine if you need additional please feel free to use the completely removed the isweakkey check from the function in the mscorlib i am absolutely certain that i modified the correct and that i did it disassembler does no longer show the the funny thing is that visual still throws the same leads me to believe that mscorlib must somehow still be cached renaming to leads to so it must still be dependent on the original is quite interesting but i think reached the point where i have no clue what is going it just make any see attached notice in that unlike assemblies such as mscorsec and actually located in what appears to be a think i am missing something here will investigate this some after having patched out everything in and played around with both removing and generating new native images of using i am getting the same i must be noted that even after uninstalling the native mscorlib it is still using give i hope someone will be able to answer what the hell is going on because i sure	
 really say this is an issue as long as they can easily look up the change log to see whats thinking if no libraries have been updated in any of the nor have there been any changes to the product itself the version number should stay the only suggestion i could make is moving to a dated version number so that the major and minor versions change so something like would be the 17th of april 2009 release with the build number of yyyy and xxxx as the svn if you want to change the major number and want to keep the date in the minor you could use versioning a good blog article on how microsoft do their versioning at

 really specific to win32 the question when should two different error cases be identified by two different and when should they throw the same type with different values stored inside this is impossible to answer without knowing in advance all the situations your code will be called this is the problem with only being able to filter exceptions by broadly if you have a strong feeling that it would be useful to treat two error cases throw different it is frequently the case that the string returned by just needs to be logged or displayed to the there is additional wrap the win32exception with something more of your for trying to do something to a and the user running under have permission to do catch the wrap it in an exception class of your whose message gives the filename and the operation being followed by the inner

 really to call the methods of the base but you usually to do it because the base classes will do some important initializations there that are needed for rest of the classes methods to other methods it depends on your if you just want to add something to the base classes behavior you will want to call the base classes method additionally to your own if you want to fundamentally change the you might not call the base method and implement all the functionality directly in the derived	
 really trust large number of questions on regarding whether this method or that method is belie the fact in the vast majority of code spends most of its time sitting around waiting for users to do really profile it for i think most likely find that only in the most intense work does this question the difference may well be only a couple of seconds and even only when processing huge numbers of your code working then get it working only if you find an actual performance spent optimising before finished the functionality and can properly is mostly wasted	
 really understand what conflict asking nor the problem with the fine to have two independent handles to the same thing i know that i learned in response to your question it that there is a new method on raises a new exception inside the generator to terminate the on receiving this the code must either raise or is called when a generator is so this means the code gets one last chance to run before the generator is this last chance means that statements in generators can now be guaranteed to the clause will now always get a chance to this seems like a minor bit of language but using generators and is actually necessary in order to implement the statement described by pep that handles the situation where a statement is used in a but it yields in the middle but never context method will be called when the generator is regards to the file handle i sometimes forget that there exist platforms that far as locks i think dowgird hits the head on the nail he just have to be aware that the generator is just like any other object that holds i think the statement is really that relevant since this function suffers from the same deadlock yield yield

 reason having a is generally bad is that today your function might look class int amount in the you might improve your blur to instead have something class int horizontalamount int verticalamount now when you execute that saved it will no longer compile because there is no longer an then to get backwards compatibility you will need to the amount value to now mean horizontalamount 5 verticalamount 5 in the long you will be better off by having an interpreted file format from the	
 reason in particular to stay away from as good a language as stackoverflow uses it for so it works on a successful and you can get jobs programming in proprietary thing would be a consideration if you were programming as a hobby or off your own limited or you wanted to contribute to the development of the guessing neither of these are the as others have pointed open source environments for	
 reason it has to be in should generally work i think i done java stored procedures for a long time you should just be able to open an io stream as you always would in	
 reason not a compilation is because perfectly valid to send a message not known at compile time to any object any object can be configured to handle messages dynamically as all method calls are really messages being sent to if you see any warnings you should address as in most cases they can lead to problems you the misleading aspect is here is that if you compile a file once and it has only if you compile other classes without making changes to the class that has the warning will not show in the compiler so every now and then you may want to all and build again to make sure you miss any helmstetter	
 reason that does not allow you to rebind references is given in and evolution of is not possible to change what a reference refers to after that once a reference is initialized it cannot be made to refer to a different object it cannot be i had in the past been bitten by algol68 references where can either assign through to the object referred to or assign a new reference value to depending on the type of i wanted to avoid such problems in

 reasons could of the queries only run against the initial set of making for faster queries in additional tables were added after the initial development and an alter table command may have been prohibitively was an initial intention to make contacts of one specific type or another but descended from a parent was a need for multiple child rows for a given parent this would be in the case of an indexed key as opposed to a so it might not seen systems where a structure like this would actually speed things up a bit because of the smaller queries and the smaller associated tables being kept in a memory cache at the logic	
 recall learning about the data structure a number of years ago and have been fascinated with it ever it originated with a by searched and not been able to find a prefer a but at this point would accept any pointers people might a data structure is a way to store 2 rectangluar explicitly maintaining the whitespace between inserted this is as opposed to a which just stores the inserted data there are many mostly interested in an implementation but would also accept alternatives that have similar stitching any open source	
 recall that dot net has a default exception handler which is triggered when the exception crosses a particular it is this handler that is causing your app to i remember looking at this issue some time back but unfortunately no longer have access to the as for the differences in behaviour between and cf this is because the two handle frames differently frames in cf have parents or something like can hook into this default exception handling and do whatever you i think the code i implemented was along these

 recently took a quick look at what impressed me with lightspeed tools which work very well vs designers ever i fast they answered questions and added was a showstopper for me was that they heavily rely on and there seem to be overrides in most so my options when it comes to deciding exactly how things get mapped were not as good as i supposedly lightspeed 3 will address this to allow you to do more stayed away from nhibernate because of all the but then found fluent nhibernate and it looks like work out pretty no designer although some might say by design on your nhibernate also seems to be the most used orm for so a bet in that so far been able to map most of what i can come up any i get very far with lightspeed because of the customization if i was starting a fresh project that could conform to their it might be a different the company is so i would really like to use one of their products

 refer to any length of a single operation could take ms on a webservice and 100 seconds in a database and they both could be using hard to know quite what if asking whether accessing a local database is generally faster than accessing a similar service over the then i expect the answer is that the local database will be the call over the internet to the web service has a lot of overhead and communication over internet is relatively evan on a slow computer a databases can perform many thousands of simple queries per contrast that with access over the where be lucky to get 50 round trip requests per not even accounting for time it takes to perform the requested operation on the asking whether a server on the web can serve data faster by avoiding a database and calculating results then the answer is it the call to the database in this case adds unnecessary overhead if the data in it can be easily calculated in a the answer to this question really have anything to do with a is it faster to calculate an answer in a function or to access the answer using a query on a as i the answer would depend on the complexity of the particular function you had to and weighing its computation time against the overhead of accessing the answer part of the directly from a the answer to your question depends on what exactly it would also probably help to know asking the i have a suspicion that the real answer is that this probably something you need to worry not really a practical concern unless you have a particular situation requiring concerned about comparison of speed when webservice and database are both on a pretty sure the overhead of the db is a less than the the application typically maintains a stateful to the while requests to a webservice are via which is relatively higher and could be best answer would be to whip up a simple and measure time it takes to retrieve results using both and create an app that opens a lot of threads and do some load if your app maintain an open connection or have access to a pool of connections with the then the db alternative may well be initial creation of a db connection can be relatively but that figure into since you should write your app so that an open connection is always

 relational database paradigm makes some assumptions about usage of relation consists of an unordered set of rows in a relation have the same set of column has a fixed name and data type and semantic meaning on all in a relation are identified by unique values in primary key assumptions support simplicity and at the cost of some not all data management tasks fit into this kind of entities with complex attributes or variable attributes do for if you need flexibility in areas where a relational database solution support you need to use a different kind of are other solutions for managing data with different semantic web for allows each entity to define its own attributes and to be by treating metadata as attributes just like this is more flexible than the structure imposed by a relational but that flexibility comes with a cost of its you should use the right tool for each also my other answer to

 requires random access so your only options to use that are vector or it will swap the and at a guess vector will probably perform slightly faster than deque because it typically has a simpler underlying data the difference is likely very marginal you use a there is a specialisation which should swap the pointers rather than the however because not random access use mergesort instead of which will probably mean that the algorithm itself is a little i think the answer is normally if you have large classes for each element so copying overhead dominates the sorting list might beat or alternatively you could store pointers to them in a vector and supply a custom predicate to sort them

 run into similar things in my two things found with that helped me the be afraid necessarily of memory allocations are very so allocating an array on the fly can often be faster than making an whether this will help depends a lot on how using the the only pitfall i see is if you return a fixed size array going to have to check for edge cases in the routine using your on how large your matrix of squares is in your you may be better off doing 1 check up front to see if on the and if precomputing the full array and returning if on an you can handle those special cases separately a 1 or 2 element array as this would put one larger statement in but that is often faster in my if the model is i would avoid precomputing all of the the overhead in the squares may outweigh the my as preallocating and returning using yield makes the jit more likely to inline your which can make a big difference in if you can take advantage of the ienumerable results and you are not always using every returned that is but precomputing may be other thing to consider i know what information is saved in square in your but if hte object is relatively and being used in a large matrix and iterated over many consider making it a i had a routine similar to this hundreds of thousands or millions of times in a and changing the class to a in my sped up the routine by over this is assuming using as the jit does many more optimizations on structs in the latest are other potential pitfalls to switching to struct of but it can have huge performance

 second part of the question is the most interesting one to i prefer to put within the classes that use when a logical place for even if used in other but that causes some problems with forward declarations we use heavily for in one recent project we had a class called with an embedded typedef called which made for very readable code an is very clear and but whenever we wanted to use the we had to include the declaration of the even if all we needed was the declaration of since no way i know to a type within a that we ended up doing it both we created a global and then to it that our code have to be not the prettiest but it got the job for the other use any special convention for the for we often use unlikely that ever change from a map to some other container but if is descriptive enough and conflict with an existing often use it generally bother creating typedefs for the since easy very to simply use or that we sometimes typedef them if the type name is so long that makes the code look too know of any better way to say but you probably know what i create different typedefs for each even if two of them define exactly the same they can change independent of one so having different type names for them simplifies any later it also makes for more readable in many

 setting up a large database that will generate statistical reports from incoming system will for the most part operate as rows about 30 mostly and datetime will be uploaded each its approximately 60mb while in flat file but grows steeply in the db with the addition of suitable statistics will be generated from the current from these statistics will be generated and data set will get copied into a partitioned history the the current data set was not can be queried by end users for information that is not likely to include but relationships between may request specialized searches from the history but the queries will be crafted by a the next the current data table is will essentially be version 2 of our existing using mysql myisam tables was killing on space usage and suffering greatly on and is currently not a partitioned tabled as support in order to get around the tremendous amount of time and its taking to insert records into writing each day to an unindexed and then on the weekends during our slowest writing the queue to the history the problem is that any historical queries generated in the week are possibly several days behind we reduce the indexes on the historical table or its queries become definitely moving to at least mysql we stay with for the next release but strongly considering i know that debate has been done to but i was wondering if anybody had any advice relevant to this most of the research is revolving around web site indexing is really our main beef with mysql and it seems like postgresql may help us out through partial indexes and indexes based on read dozens of articles about the differences between the but most are postgresql has long been labeled but is that still generally the case comparing mysql to postgresql or is it more balanced databases and ms are simply not an option although i wish oracle on myisam vs innodb for were running innodb and for we found it much like times we were also much newer to mysql and frankly not sure we had db tuned appropriately for running in an environment with a very high degree of uptime battery network backup fully redundant so the integrity concerns with myisam were weighed and deemed regards to heard the stability issues concern with generally i assume that any recently last 12 piece of software is not the updated feature set in is just too much to pass up given the chance to the regards to postgresql without any where clause is a pretty rare case for i anticipate this being an from nearly as flexible as load data infile but an intermediate loading table will fix biggest concern is the lack of insert often used it when building some processing table so that we could avoid putting multiple records in twice and then having to do a giant group by at the end just to remove some i think its used just infrequently enough for the lack of it to be for

 setting up some selenium tests for an internal web app and looking for advice on a testing one of the tests is going to add some data via the ui that cannot be removed via the ui you can add a record via the web but removing requires contacting someone internally to remove it at the database how do you typically account for cleaning up data after the selenium test is app in question is written in php and using php for testing selenium rc and but open to other as this is just a broad best practice the app being tested is in our development so not particularly worried about data carrying over from connect to the database in the selenium test to cleanup the something like to manage add data and worry about cleaning it up the lazy seems most of the ideas centered around the same work off a known set of data and restore when the tests are the mechanism for this probably will vary depending on amount of but this looks like it should work for my up data after a selenium

 shared functionality back to a framework or library with defined interfaces and default implementations is a common way to handle for your plugin if you choose to support is probably something that could be shared among all of your most of the time the things you want to share are pretty basic functionality or relatively abstract functionality that can be easily the former are easier to recognize and factor out to common the latter may sometimes be more work than simply the code with minor changes patterns rather than thing you want to be careful of is to let the actual drive the design of common libraries rather than coming up with a shared architecture in very tempting to get caught up in framework design and abstracting it out for shared unfortunately you often find that the shared use never develops or develops in a different direction than you expected and you end up rewriting or throwing away much of the framework or even keeping and maintaining unused let yagni gonna need be your guide and delay refactoring to common libraries until you actually have a

 short answer is that it looks up the a look at this example interaction logic for public partial class window1 public private void routedeventargs dependencyobject track dependencyobject track2 track null public childitem where childitem for i i dependencyobject child if null child is return childitem childofchild if return return public childitem where childitem ienumerable children int count foreach v in dependencyobject child v as if null child is return childitem childofchild if childofchild if return return the if you step through it get a better understanding of what the differences are between the two element you should also see that looking through the you can find the even though it internal to the but you with the very rarely need to traverse the mostly there since the framework uses it to resolve dependencyproperties and that necessarily more info on the differences take a look at this	
 short answer is that you not without going through you get an it contains stack trace but that information contain anything regarding the parameters that were passed to the method at the get around you have to store the parameters in your exception handler code so you can have access to them when the exception is you would have an object which you would pass the parameter instances to with their and then call a method on that object in your catch

 simple or a more treatment in google is your	
 simple rule is if you are going to query the then it should be a discrete field within a table within the if you can store the blob and be done with if you want to derive from a and index then you can do that readily as your data types are congruent with what the database can support can be accurately there can be some value is exploding the blob in to its component parts that map nicely in to db problem with defining on the could be easily is not so much the definition of the but the potential change of the tables that are being changed a column or tend to be unusable for the duration of the not an issue for 100 a real problem for millions of the data definitions are fairly then creating a mapping facility that lets your users describe the and then you use that definition to both create a compliant table and convert the blobs appropriately during for the rows of different you can still stuff that data in to a single some rows have columns compared to each row is identified by if you have lots of row and lots of you get lots of wasted space doing then you may want to go to having a table for each row and a master table that holds the row types and references to the real rows in the actual you would only need this master table if you care about the relationships of the original data packets to each other you can store them in receipt it all boils down to how much data you how much you how much work you want to do vs how much you already have

 simplest approach that i can think is to add some logic into your data access layer that will inject a domain object with its dependencies before returning it to a higher layer called the service you could annotate each properties to indicate what needs to get wired if not on java you could implement an interface for each component that needs to be or even declare this all in xml and feed that data to the context that will do the if you wanted to get you could pull this out into an aspect and apply it globally across your data access layer so all methods that pull out domain objects will wire up them up just after they are

 simplest way to answer your question might be to turn your question upside that the cryptoserviceprovider implementation holds all the it is just as fast and uses just as little memory as why do both implementations do we even in the at what we know about each one generates cryptographically secure random the other makes no is generating random numbers that are sufficiently random to be used in or generating numbers that simply but guarantee anything there a cost associated with generating cryptographically secure random then random number generator would do can usually assume that standard library functions are designed to do what it says on the box and do it is designed to get you the next random number in a sequence of numbers efficiently as is designed to generate random numbers strong enough to be used in and do as efficiently as if there was a way to do this as efficiently as then would use it question seems to assume brain damage on the part of the framework designers that they somehow designed a needlessly slow function to generate cryptographically secure random even though there was a faster fastest way to generate cryptographically secure random numbers is most likely to call the function designed by experts to generate cryptographically secure random

 slightly abrupt way to end editing can be achieved with the following always but a bit more intense than need most of the a more official description of see the documentation link should only be used as a last resort when you get the fieldeditor to resign first so you might want to try a more subtle approach before you resort to the extreme measures like be more in the class for apple proposes something resembling making the window firstresponder proceed force the first responder to resign the above link to see their exact example i shortened it here because obviously not interested in using the fieldeditor after this in your described use	
 slower compared to the important thing is not if its but if its slow it for if you instantiate objects using reflection in web environment where expected concurency can rise up to it will be its good not to be concerned about performance in if things turns out to be you can always speed them up if you designed things correctly so that parts that you expected might be in need of optimisation in future are can check this famous article if you need speed but the tale of three a wolf and the dynamicmethod and ilgenerator	
 smart is garbage collection when it comes to nested this code for class private know that gc works by looking at how many references and any object without any references ends up getting so in this where a reference coming from a member is that a memory leak waiting to happen you implement now assuming that the gc is smart enough for since it could probably check to see if any references are coming from the object and just not count them towards the reference but i thought i would dig a nested

 so i really see why you would need the wildcard feature if you can already support the matching described in the first this is what i put given a query string you use a regular expression to create a regular re example the query will become the then use this regex for your matching using the method to get something like static string string query string re pattern regex matcher m if return else return will return the first match to your camel case query in the string i have added a line to handle wildcards since in my tired stupor i appreciate the need for

 so there were a couple of things wrong with my original no i had to add an internal test to verify that my code could encrypt and decrypt before wrapping it in that was silly of the transformfinalblock method of both the encryptor and decryptor objects seem to perform as the function cleartext as byval key as as prepare dim keybytes dim sourcebytes prepare encryption dim aes new dim encryptor dim ms new dim cs new dim encrypted decrypted not log as new return function base64cipher as byval key as as dim keybytes dim cipherbytes prepare decryption dim aes new dim decryptor dim ms new dim cs new dim decryptedbytes as redim dim readbytecount dim decrypted return be modifying this code to bump up the aes algorithm to and cbc cipher which requires an initial vector this adds a level of complexity to the implementation that i ready to add until the rest worked of the to all those who commented on my

 solution i have seen utilized by commercial windows libraries is naming the solution files with the vs version as a suffix you still have to keep them in but you have to change file or include or modify the actual solution files just keep multiple one for each vs version which is you have to do the same thing for the project but at least you have to change the contents around to support different directory structures unless you want to support building with multiple vs and in the case where you do you only have to change the output settings for each different project saying a great but rather just another	
 solution in is a solution using the extension result keystring str is no linq syntax for the aggregate clause in apparently there is in for some predefined solution might look somewhat but the aggregate method is quite aggregate works like if you have a you can combine all values into a aggregate is in contrast to the which modify the length of the or the which does shrink the but it still remains a list of a single if you have a list you can combine them into a single value like xs sum sumsofar you give two values to the a seed value and a start aggregating with a single seed value in this combiner function gets called for each value in the first argument is the computed result so far the first later this will have other and it combines it with the value in short how the method works on it works the same on but just with different

 solution you propose seems like a good as long as you mind people being able to view the part of the site if they are logged ie as long as the http part of the site does not contain any sensitive and the only difference between logged in and users is something harmless in the reason it is not used very often may be one scenario may just not be very usually if you care enough to make part of your site restrict the login session just to that secure or make the entire site always use https solutions exist which are secure and which are capable of more than for example logging in someone at an https login form and maintaining that session while transferring them back to an also think flickr or their sign in page is always but once the started you migrate back to http while maintaining the session since i wrote this back in 2009 the practice of having a secure connection for the login screen but dropping back to http once logged in seems to have possibly because the overhead of using https is not seen as so much of a big now more than sites are increasingly using https as the whenever they accept user

 some dissent since this got bumped so some relevant bits from the research shows that the standard really define forward nor does it explicitly state that enums can or be forward from section underlying type of an is an integral type that can all the enumerator values defined the it which type is used as the underlying for an enumeration except that underlying type shall not be than int unless the value of enumerator cannot fit in an int unsigned if the is the underlying type is as the enumeration had a enumerator with value the value applied to an an object of enumeration or an is the value applied to the the underlying type of an enum is with one minor we flip to the section on which is about as close as we come to any standard on forward class that has been declared but not or an array of unknown size or of incomplete element is an object class type as might be incomplete at one point in a translation unit and complete later the type is the same type at both the declared type of an array object might be an array of incomplete class type and therefore if the class type is completed later on in the translation the array type becomes the array type at those two points is the same the declared type of an array object might be an array of unknown size and therefore be incomplete at one point in a translation unit and complete later the array types at those two points of unknown bound of and of n are different the type of a pointer to array of unknown or of a type defined by a typedef declaration to be an array of unknown cannot be the standard pretty much laid out the types that can be forward enum so compiler authors generally regard forward declaring as disallowed by the standard due to the variable size of its underlying makes enums are usually referenced in and the compiler would indeed need to know the storage size in those since the storage size is implementation many compilers may just choose to use 32 bit values for the underlying type of every at which point it becomes possible to forward declare an interesting experiment might be to try forward declaring an enum in visual then forcing it to use an underlying type greater than as explained above to see what	
 some experimentation around question matching a string as i ran across another weird matching consider the following code that treats a string as a sequence of string val uha uha match case case case input on the empty string correctly yields if i rewrite the first match clause as matching of fails and matches the default clause through the scala library source code you have to do in an ideal world i believe that both and will result in this does not concur with the phenomenon described above because only matches the empty upon some further experimentation this question can be narrowed down to the list emptyseq boolean basically means that an empty does not automatically equal when matching against a constant opposed to using an extractor as suggested by this unequality leads to the failing same is true when interpreting the empty as a does the empty string not match as

 some limited a hash map could but you need to think how going to purge cached images from memory when the cache gets you define that probably some maximum amount of memory that you want to devote to how going to deal with how going to deal with the case where client a requests an and then client b requests the same image while it is still being loaded into the cache for client very simple solution to could be to always store softreferences to the image data and let the jvm take care of deciding when to purge them in mind it could arbitrarily purge them at times beyond your you need to develop some kind of policy image accessed longest image image that will take longest to decode if we have to load it again only you know your data and so you have to find the right will generally help you you may decide to use explicit locks and other concurrency utilities in fancier a fairly elegant solution proposed by goetz et al is to hijack the future in your you store a future to the cached object to your if a requester finds that a future has already been added to the then it can call and wait for the other thread to finish caching the could achieve a similar effect with an explicit lock and but future takes some of the work out for i agree with the poster who said you probably want to store the images in their original coded but from your code assuming that was probably what you were intending all

 spot on that you want some sort of case classes to model your in functional languages these sorts of things are called data and you can read all about how haskell uses them by googling around a equivalent of adts uses sealed traits and case look at a of the json parser from the scala standard library or the programming in scala instead of using to represent json and instead of using any to represent arbitrary json it uses an abstract data to represnt json has several representing the possible kinds of json and json data of this form involves pattern since the jsvalue is the compiler will warn you if you dealt with all the for the code for a method that takes a and returns a representation of that looks like def string x match case jsnull case case s case case case matching both lets us make sure dealing with every and also the underlying value from its it provides a way of knowing that handled every if you know at the structure of the json data dealing you can do something really cool like very powerful check it

 standard answers all questions in section a at most one of the data members can be active at any that the value of at most one of the data members can be stored in a union at any one special guarantee is made in order to simplify the use of if a contains several that share a common initial sequence and if an object of this type contains one of the it is permitted to inspect the common initial sequence of any of see the size of a union is sufficient to contain the largest of its data each data member is allocated as if it were the sole member of a means each member share the same memory there at most one member but you find out which you will have to store that information about the currently active member yourself somewhere storing such a flag in addition to the union example having a struct with an integer as the and an union as the will give you a so called an union which knows what type in it is currently the common use is in where you can have different but depending on the you have different informations to store into each struct to show what a common initial sequence tokeni int type tag union struct int struct int int struct int struct string standard allows you to access of each because the common initial sequence of each exist compiler extensions that allow accessing all members disregarding which one currently has its value that allows efficient reinterpretation of stored bits with different types among each of the for the following may be used to dissect a float variable into 2 unsigned unsigned short float can come quite handy when writing if the compiler does not support that but you do it you write code whose results are not so be certain your compiler has support for it if you use that

 starting a process from a java i hold onto it and at later points in the program i may send it some signals as in unix signals a different to tell it to clean itself up and shut which is the proper way of terminating this i may later restart and hold onto the process and stop it again an arbitrary number of like my when it to signal the process to terminate and make sure it since java starts the process up it persists and continues to run after my program thought i would do this in the destructor for the object that contains the process but it seems that java does not have a it has a method for freeing memory allocated through but this is not such a and apparently you guarantee that will be it is only called when the object is garbage and the program might run through to termination without ever calling garbage in which case everything is freed at once and no garbage collection and no the best way to make sure that when my program exits this cleanup code gets called see that java has introduced a but i am currently stuck on java do i cleanup an opened process in

 strictly do this a single in a general because different platforms use different executable the jvm thing is relying on having a jvm already installed on the destination if there is one then your jar run unless you install a jvm in a perhaps more any python packages that rely on binary extensions will not play well with jython unless specifically released in a jython which is presume that a similar situation holds for ruby though i have no direct knowledge nor even how common it is for ruby packages to use binary be able to use the whole range of java but very little in the way of also worth noting that the jvm versions of languages tend to lag behind the standard offering fewer language features and your code is pure then already as long as the destination machine already has python just as java but at least in rather less safe to assume that python is installed than to assume that java is the elements are likely to be user expectations about a reasonable installation process vary considerably across too if your app uses libraries or better include all of them for windows but users tend to be more tolerant of downloading expectations for that to be handled automatically by a package manager are if this is a application stack and you want to be able to have a bundle that can be deployed on almost any the easiest route would probably be to distribute it as a complete vmware virtual machine the player software is free at least windows and but i presume for mac as and it allows you to create a dedicated system already fully configured specifically for your say because then you need to worry about os licensing a smaller application that you want to allow to run on a existing then i suspect that compatibility will be less of a concern than compatibility while apache have a windows the vast majority of windows webservers run and having a single package distribution even single version of your that plays well with both of those webservers is likely to be

 subversion all others are not source code control managers always thought scm means software configuration but version control means they store changes to the stuff you store in it have to be source it could be image bitmap configuration files or all kinds of only 1 reason why built binaries be considered as part of this and because you can rebuild think why you would want to store the released binaries in there as its a system to assist not to tell you how you should build your make the computer work for instead of against so what if storing binaries takes up space you have hundreds of gigabytes of disk space and super fast its not a big deal to store binary objects in there anymore ten years ago it might have been a problem this is perhaps why people think of binaries in scm as a bad as a you might be comfortable with using the system to rebuild any version of an but the others who might use it might this means need an alternative system to store the and you already have such a its your make use of you assume that you rebuild from obviously you store all the source code in but you store the the the and the other dependant bits that are what happens when someone comes along and asks you build me the version we shipped 2 years a customer has a problem with that 2 years is an eternity do you even have the same compiler you used back what happens when you check all the source out only to find that the newly updated sdk is incompatible with your source and fails with do you wipe your development box and reinstall all the dependencies just to build this can you even remember what all the dependencies last point is the big to save a few k of disk you might cost yourself days if not weeks of law also says that whichever app you need to rebuild will be the one that required the most difficult to set up dependency you were ever glad to get rid store the binaries in your worry over we stick all binaries in their own directory per then when we want to update a we use a special project that consists of nothing but you export the setup project and done as it fetches the right things and puts them into the right directory

 sum up all the observations and it is not possible to alter entries in the perspective it is to make perspective appear in the order that we want on perspective we can achieve it by adding an entry in as shown if we want to fetch this ordered we fetch it but as this ini file entry internally gets recorded in preferencestore we can fetch the same value from preferencestore using the following api as shown would someone need to access the entry defined in ini file at in my case i had a view in which i had to display links to every as my perspective bar was sorted in desired i also wanted to maintain the same order in my view while displaying links to there is no known way to inflict the same sort order in the display of perspective while a new custom perspective switcher can be written to achieve the desired

 super but this will do the only downside is a program editor window will be open after it probably a way to close it when done but i know what that is off this says to open a new program editor window and make sure no other code is in then include the contents of into the then submit all the code in the program a side in addition to a toolbar i think you could map a function key to a command like this as press f9 to pull up the current there is a limit to the length of the command mapped to a key though so no long	
 supporting code is but you want not to be distracted by it when you want there are two technologies that can with will help you modularize your code so that and so on can be implemented once and then combined with many other it will also help you write unit some good ways to learn the techniques are to read the paper functional programming and to learn about the i am not a shill for john but he does do wonderful you cannot use a programming language with powerful capabilities for modularization and or if you want don technique will help you organize your code so that you can split up parts the way you want and pay attention only to what you when you the tool supports any language that can be written in and also combinations of those	
 supports bits and bit strings	
 supports for some major this might be a better alternative if you have a suitable database approach with because it could reduce the reliability of your application if not managed could use it in conjunction with local file logging by using a bufferingforwardingappender to batch your network logging and send only when you get a message that exceeds a certain that you can have sufficient context to trace but only when errors	
 supports two forms of string string and string string consists of zero or more characters enclosed in double as in and may include both simple escape sequences as for the tab and hexadecimal and unicode escape string consists of an character followed by a zero or more and a closing a simple example is in a verbatim string the characters between the delimiters are interpreted the only exception being a in simple escape sequences and hexadecimal and unicode escape sequences are not processed in verbatim string a verbatim string literal may span multiple regular string verbatim string in verbatim string literals you should escape double info at at basics programming at with strings in in and prefix enables the use of keywords as which is useful when interfacing with other programming the character is not actually part of the so the identifier might be seen in other languages as a normal without the an identifier with an prefix is called a verbatim use of the prefix for identifiers that are not keywords is but strongly discouraged as a matter of public static void if static void	
 supports xmp you should append your specific information as a payload in the xmp	
 suppose a fairly obvious example would be string concatenating just a handful of you may as well just use the operator or more than that and you should really consider using stringbuilder for performance that the kind of thing thinking	
 suppose i have this class public int age public int myclassb class public int randomnumber xmlserializer will serialize the object like can i made the property age to not serialize the property age when under tried with the but it serialize my object like reading the msdn documentation i found cannot apply the isnullable property to a member typed as a value type because a value type cannot contain nullnothingnullptra null reference in visual you cannot set this property to false for nullable value when such types are nullnothingnullptra null reference in visual they will be serialized by setting to understand a value type be set to a valuetype is always set to the serialization make the decision to serialize it or not based on current tried with the but it work i tried creating an agecontainer object and manipulate serialization with but it work i really want the property age is below 0 like have to implement custom what i though but like to get away without the the object is much more and i would like to not handle the serialization to make a value type nullable with	
 suppose it depends on the scale of your data hosting something small with maybe a couple hundreds pictures per day flowing you can moderate them on your a couple hundred thousands need an amount of human beings sorting the weeds either a moderator team or users themselves who submit abuse one to can be dependent on your success of your service as well as on the type of the if something simple like rapidshare where one does not see what the other the chances that users will see each others content and through this notice and hopefully report unacceptable content are if something very social like flickr you can bet on it reports will be flowing suppose you could automate something but almost an impossible you automatically detect you automatically detect images violating copyrights making footprints of copyrighting material in order to compare them with the uploaded stuff is a real challenge for companies with resources like youtube and for now this kind of work can effectively be done only by are also legal issues to in some countries the service owner is not liable for what users contribute if cooperative enough to delete certain content at in others he will get the charges himself for not having premoderated all the incoming also think of this with regard to whatever and wherever you are going to

 sure if this will but you could try using the method of the text i would try having a single space at the end of the document and keeping the caret positioned after that but when you insert a insert it before the that way the caret position will remain at the end of the document thinking that the text pane might be getting redrawn once when you call and once when you call and that might be contributing to the not though been a while since i worked with

 sure the methods that claim to deal with an value packed into an int actually deal with so you ought to be able to do something values of int argb int oldalpha if argb you could maybe use the methods to retrieve blocks of pixel	
 sure the netbeans ide has a project template for database driven never used it myself but the netbeans examples are usually quite good so might be worth checking like elie said i doubt it makes much difference if you use java or use the one you are the most comfortable with and if you have no experience with obviously biased there	
 sure where but certainly on i get a request for each net console you can very little coming back across the wire 500b what aiming for a lean web service that returns the minimum you need to display that back to the on top of as the others have cache previous that the results often and so if you display your ordering you can work on the principle of now is better than completely accurate	
 sure why this working but as a you could just use in your method to update the person	
 sure you are adequately separating your calculation logic from the i would use a class to actually determine the grades multiple classes with a nice inheritance to actually do the and the just render appropriately in your user you have multiple classes some property for determining what type a particular isntance you could also then easily create a factory to instantiate user controls for you where you will get the correct user control based on the calculation

 systems have to manage the sizes of cpu caches in order to reduce explains page more the data stored in the caches units called must be carefully selected based on how often it is whether it is likely to be used again and how it would be to the data from main these choices are important in applications where memory bandwidth is a type of thing is often done with a priority queue that implements the paging replacement strategy chosen by the os these queues determine which pages are replaced when new data is moved to the and where the data will be located in the you should consult documentation if you want to find out what strategy is being the data in the cache in main needs to be placed started at specific boundaries in order to be accessed efficiently to be moved into a cpu if data extra computation is needed to align

 table is already a string to an int is not further may seem but the word is being over used to the point where becoming	
 table is the central type in and can be treated as either an associative array table or or as an ordinary the keys can be values of any lua type except and the elements of a table can hold any value except member access is made more efficient than hash key access behind the but the details usually that actually makes handling sparse arrays handy since storage only need be allocated for those cells that contain a value at does lead to a universal array idiom that feels a little strange to a c 3 an array stored in the variable with three elements that have the same values as their because the elements are stored at sequential indices beginning with the length of by or is a table with keys can be done like return 17 will have entries named and an anonymous of looking up that last element without iterating the table might be tricky unless a copy of that very function is stored in some other place that curly braces appear is really the same semantic but it is concealed a new user of behind some syntactic it is common to write functions that take a single argument that should be a in that calling the function does not require use of this results in code that seems to contain a mix of and both apparently used as a function call equivalent to is also less hard on the calling a function with a literal value also works for string

 taken a long look around and find any information on altering managed resources in assemblies that already familar with win32 resources and the apis for altering application has resources that need to be updated by the end user and the application will be distributed as a single executable i just use satellite see a few possible but they seem first is to use create a new assembly which contains the new resources and use ilmerge to combine it with the original assembly to form the new the only downside is that resources cannot be updated or second is somewhat there would be a from the which is ran against with the switch to add the resources to form the new the downside being that none of the resources in the original assembly would be leaning towards the ilmerge but the terms on redistribution are the eula makes no reference to redistribution rights i assume in this negative freedom society that yet the microsoft research page says redistribution is not permitted ambiguously from what i can tell it might be referring to commercial which apply to me since this is a gpl can i and update resources in clr

 takes less time to produce code than i say i mean with comments that communicate your intention clearly at every typing comments takes some and your coworkers should all be smart enough to figure out what you intended just by reading your descriptive function and variable names and spelunking their way through all your executable but it takes more of their time to do it than if you had just explained your and clear documentation is especially helpful when the logic of the code turns out to be not that code would ever be firmly believe that if you time it from when you start a project to when you ship a writing code takes less for one having to explain clearly what doing forces you to think it through and if you write a concise explanation of what your code is accomplishing then probably not designed and for another purely selfish and code is far easier to dump onto someone else to maintain thus freeing the original author to go create the next big i rarely if ever have to stop what doing to explain how my code was meant to work because blatantly obvious to anyone who can read english if they read and one more reason my memory just that i recall what i had for breakfast much less what i was thinking when i wrote code a month or a year perhaps your memory is far better than but because i document my intentions i can quickly pick up wherever i left off and make changes without having to first figure out what i was thinking when i wrote why i document well not because i feel some noble calling to produce pretty code fit for and not because a but simply because it lets me ship quality software in less

 talking about separation of data the word disk can be interchanged with it sounds though as if you are only using a single lun presenting your entire raid 5 array as a single you have 16 or 16 for example 4 quad core you should only really look to create a separate data file for each cpu in my suggest you read the following articles regarding the tempdb database before going ahead with any paying particular attention i create multiple tempdb database about the tempdb	
 talking about two different is a simulation tool while an fpga board is real there will be real hardware will be generally faster but with a you can have all sorts of debugging trying to probe a specific signal is just a matter of adding a line to the you can easily make changes to the simulated model instead of having to redesign the fpga you run simulation on a sufficiently powerful you can sometimes approximate performance that the fpga is a slow in you should do use a simulator to do your basic development and move onto your fpga hardware once your design is sufficiently well

 tests localize failures more tests more closely correspond to user requirements and so are better predictor of delivery neither of them is much good unless built and but both of them are very valuable if properly thing with units tests is that no integration level test can exercise all the code as much as a good set of unit tests that can mean that you have to refactor the tests but in general your tests depend on the internals so lets say for example that you have a single function to get a power of you describe it a formal methods claim you specify returns for 0 p test and your spec look essentially the same is sort of for your implementation can be a for loop with a and you can come along later and change that to a you change the implementation so returning 16 bits that is only guaranteed to be no less than then this tests will fail an test should probably but not and just as likely as not to fail somewhere far downstream of the computation of point is that they really test for diferent if you could build sufficiently details and extensive integration you might be able to get the same level of coverage and degree of but probably hard to do at and the exponential explosion will defeat by partitioning the state space using unit the number of tests you need grows much less than

 that comparable is also a generic parameterized by what type it is comparable the most way to declare your mergesort function above extends super enforces that the type compareto method can accept an argument of type a type could implement but not be comparable to like implements so it is important to have the requirement on the type parameter of in any comparable class should be comparable to at least require that extends super instead of just extends because it is okay if a type method accepts a more general type than because it would still be able to accept an argument of type this is important if you have a class which implements and then you have a subclass b which extends b cannot implement because b already implements inherited from and a class cannot implement an interface so if we required extends b would not satisfy and we would not be able to sort

 the answer appears to be as quick merge sort and heap sort tend to perform better in the and insertion sort appears to excel at incremental that adding elements to a list one at a time over an extended period of time while keeping the list especially if the insertion sort is implemented as a linked list average case a heap seems to be able to perform just as well for incremental sorting or removing a single element from a heap has a scenario of so what exactly does insertion sort have to offer over other sorting algorithms or there ever a good reason to use insertion	
 the answer to has most of the information you need to put together your might also want to see the chapter on sorting in has a completely fine although i hate using like a more familiar way to do the same thing is to go through the keys of the hash but sort by the sort keys do it this way because a little less do i sort a hash by value instead of by brian d sort a start with the in this we give the list of keys to the sort function which then compares them asciibetically might be affected by your locale the output list has the keys in asciibetical once we have the we can go through them to create a report which lists the keys in asciibetical sort cmp keys my printf could get more fancy in the block instead of comparing the we can compute a value with them and use that value as the to make our report order we use the sequence in a string to make everything the block then compares the lowercased values to determine in which order to put the sort cmp keys if the computation is expensive or the hash has many you may want to look at the schwartzian transform to cache the computation we want to sort by the hash value we use the hash key to look it we still get out a list of but this time they are ordered by their sort keys there we can get more if the hash values are the we can provide a secondary sort on the hash sort cmp keys

 the the async attribute is for the case where your page is going to call some task that also blocks the and then your page needs the output from that task in order to return info to the for if your page needed to call a web wait for its and then use the data from the response to render your reason use the async attribute is to avoid blocking the this is important because applications use a thread pool to serve and there are only a relatively small number of threads and if each call ties up the thread while waiting on the web service then soon going to hit enough concurrent users that users are going to have to wait until these web service calls the async attribute lets the thread return to the thread pool and serve other concurrent visitors to your web rather than forcing it to sit still doing nothing while waiting for the web service call to upshot for you is the async attribute is designed for the case where you render the page until the asynchronous task and why it render the page need to launch your own and make it a daemon i remember the exact syntax for but you can easily find it in the doc by searching the bcl doc for this means the thread will keep your application from shutting down while it is which is important because and iis reserve the right to your when they deem it and if that happens while your thread is your task will be making the thread daemon will prevent this for some possible rare edge cases find out more when you find the documentation on daemon thread is where you will kick off these and after told the daemon thread to do the you can immediately render your page so the rendering of the page will happen better than a daemon thread in your would be to implement a windows service for doing the have your application communicate the task to be performed to the no need for a daemon thread and no need to worry about your process being how do you tell the service to do the perhaps through or perhaps by inserting a record into a database table that the service or a number of other another which i have used before for this very same write the info about your task into an msmq have another process even on another pull from that queue and do the the job of inserting into a queue is optimized to return as quickly as so your thread block while the data you put in the queue is sent across the wire or anything like it is one of the fastest ways to make note of the fact that a task needs to be done without waiting for that task to

 there a way to tell the compiler in my to optimize certain code even if that code is not i just want those symbols in the object here is a simple and i do want this function to be even if never there is no official compiler is there a trick to make the compiler think that an important or at least make it think that it safely be i tried something like bool that seem to do you really want to know why i on earth would want that it has to do with instead of explicit template instantiation with class i simply want to be able to write since in many cases easier since it implicitly instantiates all functions and it does work fine in debug mode without optimizations is what i want to do a compilable mini files are given to me and not foo t heavy long compile the standard way to instantiate it is template class but in reality it is often hard to find out exactly what types i have to usage like will instantiate dependent types if interface that i extracted from foo t no heavy can include anywhere and compile return in function undefined reference to ld returned 1 exit tried precompiled headers but the template instantiation method makes for much faster without optimization is not so ideal because then the library code and will run to tell compiler to not optimize certain code

 there are a handful of ways to do what but a good number of them are not going to be implementation you could use locks or but they will really only work on threaded servers and probably not at all in a more or less means the locking implementation will be up to two file on your file property in your model both you have to manually set the lock object on update and check against it on try something obj if raise simultaneousupdateerror this return in models locked def def overriding save because you want to use generic probably not the best idea to rework model code to accomodate view but i like to give this creates a different critical is indeed a clumsy implementation that have to clean you may not be comfortable with the fact that a different critical region has been but i see how do much better if your using the database as an implementation without making the implementation much more option would be to make the locks entirely separate then you could update them after the method is but i feel like coding that if you really want to use a locking that would also solve the if this might be the thing for something def return def if not raise if f def raise class locked def maybe some way to mix and match these suggestions to your

 there is a difference in how the objects are but they are not python allocates a where it can quickly allocate dictionary objects it dictionaries allocated via the syntax a c call to can come from this free when the dictionary is no longer referenced it gets returned to the free list and that memory block can be reused the fields are reset first dictionary gets immediately returned to the free and the next will reuse its memory you keep a the next dictionary will come from the next free x we can delete the reference to that dictionary and free its slot del the syntax is handled in it can use this optimization mentioned on the other hand is handled like a regular class constructor and python uses the generic memory which does not follow an easily predictable pattern like the free list looking at from python with the syntax it seems to the hashtable based on the number of items storing which is known at parse

 these kinds of errors data from one row in indicates that not setting the parts of your reusable so just using old but i find any part that being thing that you should definitely do and that might actually fix this is subclass which maintains those labels as then you can initialize the labels and add them as subviews in the init or wherever else you currently happening each time you grab a reusable it potentially already has those labels on it from and just piling more subviews on top of mistaken and a reusable cell has its subviews cleared out before it is

 they are both part of the same then there has to be some type of parent the window with the listbox is the parent to the details or there is a window which owns them just a matter of passing the object from one window to the your object is called and has the following datacontext is thus a when a user on one of the list box the selecteditem is one of the foo taking you provide it to your details window either by direct pass or by raising a event to the listbox owner and letting it pass the they are two separate applications then you need to start considering things such as remoting or msmq as tools to pass information between two	
 they are handling the same type of device quite reasonable to have just one interrupt handler handling multiple you could check which flag was set at the top and continue on from i recommend this if the two interrupt handlers are for different types of devices and just have the same logic

 thing to remember about except is that really just an extension to so if you are looking for help on writing expect scripts and your question is not related to one of the expect specific you should try looking in the tcl a good starting place is as well as are two ways to do what trying to and may be used when you are adding an integer value to another it is very fast for that for value does not work with and it do anything but addition subtraction if you negate the as in value if you need something more you should use value value the use of curly braces around the although they are not required for correct operation in they improve if you are doing many arithmetic using braces around the expressions will significantly improve the performance of your for more see you should get in the habit of bracing your expressions when using can find links to several expect resources at

 thing you can do is you need to do it to go from to and you need it to go from to any reference to an so you can call methods even without if you do less you let the compiler do more work for you and catch things that stated goal is to be able to check that the thing getting out of your list really is an adding as an implemented interface would allow you to achieve that goal in that your major for not doing that hold any want to be able to compare references for no com requires that if you call twice with the same guid on the same you get the same interface pointer both if you have two arbitrary interface and you them both to then the results will have the same pointer value if and only if they are backed by the same you seem to want your list to only contain and you have delphi 2009 where a generic would be you can discipline yourself to always explicitly add values to the never values of any descendant whenever you add an item to the use code like as any duplicates in the list are easy to and your are assured to actually solve the but it given the rule the object explicitly implements all its you can check for things like and if added items to the list like i described safe to disable the enabling the assertion lets you detect when someone has changed code elsewhere in your program to add an item to the list running your unit tests frequently will let you detect the problem very soon after the above points in you can check that anything that was added to the list was added correctly with this and i recall whether the compiler accepts comparing an value to an iunknown value if compiler then simply change the declaration iunknown the supports function the assertion then either you added something to the list that support at or the specific interface reference you added for some object cannot serve as the if the assertion then you know that will give you a valid that the value added to the list to be an value given your type declarations this is a safe because the interfaces implemented by form an inheritance tree that degenerates to a simple there are no branches where two interfaces inherit from each other but have a common if there were decendants of and implemented them the above code be valid because the reference held in necessarily be the reference for that the assertion would detect that and need to add it with as you disable the cost of getting the types right is paid only while adding to the not while reading from the i named the variable to discourage you from using that variable elsewhere in the there only to support the and it have a valid value once assertions are

 things are being declared an anonymous enumerated type is is being declared a typedef for that anonymous and the three names and are being declared as integral break that in the simplest an enumeration can be declared tagname declares an enumeration with the tag in c and any references to this be preceded with the for tagname declare x of type error in ok in order to avoid having to use the keyword a typedef can be tagname enum tagname declare as a typedef for can be simplified into one enum tagname declare both and if we need to be able to use with the we can make the anonymous and only declare it with the typedef enum in this declaring to be a name of an anonymous is really just an integral and should only be used to declare variables which hold one of the values listed in the declaration one of and you can assign a variable another value by so you have to be careful when reading enum and are declared as integral constants in the global since no specific values were they get assigned to consecutive integers starting with so is is and is	
 things as someone above pointed getting the type for not for so will get you the list of and more it looks like misunderstanding the purpose of in general attributes are used to mark a member for specific processing or to add additional here using the name to indicate what processing you and the attribute to specify which is mixing of or answer is more you mark the field as city then do what you like with where i disagree is that i would use different attribute rather than an public class myattribute public class mycityattribute public class public class public string city public string workcity public string fullname public public void type t fields foreach field in attributes if if is for if is for would allow you to use different parameters for mycity vs myname that would make more sense in the context of processing think with your comment you hit the nail on the that you would have to change a string constant if you rename your variable is an indicator that doing something

 things unlisted is okay if the attendees generally trust the agreed changes to be and tend to agree what the agreement on each issue in the first light approach could be to mark each case as notified but no action from the author be and so this would mean all attendees also are in sync about what really is going to be done on a single too much is sure to make code reviews tedious and which way is best would also have to do with the kind of the project something and whether the people work in the same company or if a subcontracting review money will be paid it

 think both styles have their this thinking is kind of crippling to our community in my worked in architectures that were from top to bottom and it was my favorite architecture is for at the ui level and at the functional this also encourages a language barrier that enforces the separation of ui and be a it may be simply that dynamic languages allow the developer to be lazier and to get things done knowing less about the fundamentals of whether this is a good or bad thing is up to the reader	
 think browser try pressing rather than just appearing in your log when the page is you want to make sure that a template is being then put something error prone in it and see if you get the exception something like if it fail then it being it could be something to do with timestamps on your development mode looks at the timestamps to see what needs to be label command is i recommend downloading and so you have the documentation to hand and get straight to the documentation text options in a form helper the block parameter the object name parameter is	
 think come up with the solution to match the behaviour of in your subscribe to the keyboard so you know when the keyboard will show and and the system will tell you the size of the but forget to unregister in your the methods similar to the below so that you adjust the size of your tableview to match the visible area once the keyboard here tracking the state of the keyboard separately so i can choose when to set the tableview back to full height since you get these notifications on every field forget to implement and choose somewhere appropriate to fix your tableview cgrect keyboardheight if keyboardisshowing cgrect frame the scrolling we work out a few sizes then we see where we are in the visible and set the rect we want to scroll to to be either the half view above or below the middle of the text field based on where it is in the in this we have an array of uitextfields and an enum that keeps track of so multiplying the rowheight by the row number gives us the actual offset of the frame within this outer cgrect frame cgfloat rowheight if rowheight else if rowheight else if rowheight else if rowheight cgfloat viewheight cgfloat halfheight viewheight cgfloat midpoint if seems to work quite

 think got a good grasp on how to handle memory in but doing it in c is different a bit got constructors and got the pretty straightforward new and delete and i know how to encapsulate it using using with smart pointers and within in c i handle malloc and free the same i know how to hide them and how to automate all i can figure is using functions for initiating and destroying my but how should i structure my memory writing this realized this is more a question about me understanding the flow of c than anything but one question at a for the answers but i need to rephrase i say that i use raii and smart pointers for i want the same for i know not the but how i handle memory allocation in is connected to these example in my classes i dynamically add and destroy the memory my class this way i can achieve a sort of i need to know the class handles it just this means i can the lower memory handling and just focus on a few i want to know is the in handling memory in there are no classes with to handle this for is it good to allocate memory in the beginning of a function or use a function that creates it for and how should i free them are broad questions and they differ from situation to situation but how do you prefer to handle what tips and lessons can you way to handle memory allocation in

 think i would find a way to make the data consistent rather than allowing users to enter inconsistent perhaps your management app could allow the manager to select an existing image or upload a new then set the name of the image based on this input so that be assured that the image will only remove an image when all references to it have been removed from the restrict the interaction with the data to your app so that people make those sorts of way to handle this would be to have a handler a controller in that does the image lookup based on id and returns the image coupled with caching this could be very efficient and would allow you to do image replacement as	
 think idea of storing the schema table names in a table will your view gets created in that schema by using an inner join of that schema table to syscolumns to create the you might want to consider using dds instead of sql to create a logical file over syscolumns for each not sure how many libraries you are dealing with but if they are just a few this might be use dds with is already a view so to create a dds lf for you have to create it over the underlying qadbifld physical file is also involved but i think you need any fields from that file for this a r qdbifld a s dbilb2 a s dbilfi could use dbilib dbifil if schema and table names are 10 or if you need the syscolumn names you have to do some field wrong as you could also do this with a sql create view select from where and use a table myschema varchar mytable varchar into mytableselect view select from where and ordering is being done on either the dds or the

 think looking at this the wrong the point of avoiding premature optimization to avoid to avoid the mindset you can fall your algorithm in the clearest way that you can then make sure then only worry about but also think about maintenance you follow this then your question answers the only that are allowable right from the beginning are those that are at least as clear as the straightforward

 think my question is best described as an say i have a simple model called and it has a few attributes that are simple data something the db table will contain three columns with those three attributes and i can access them with something like or the problem trying to solve is what happens when or can no longer be contained in a simple data assume that foo and goo represent the same type of that they are both instances of just with different so now thing might look like now there is a new model called that looks like far this is all now here is where if i have how can i set it up to refer to my 2 instances of whazit by name the the is that any thing will always have exactly 2 that i need to know if the whazit i have is basically foo or i do in the current but that is initial thought is to add a attribute to whazit so i can get the whatzits associated with my and then choose the whazit i want by name that that seems ugly there a better practices for multiple associations with the same class in

 think overthinking essentially what you want to know far as i can tell correct me if is which questions have been answered by a given and which questions for answer in unanswered questions are everything point of doing it this way rather than solution is that you should use what you know sooner rather than if you filter the for every question by your initial query will be selecting every single answer and every single question in these by starting from the known data the we are selecting only answers and questions related to that if you then want to combine the two sets into a single there are a bunch of ways you could do this for instance by creating a list of q in for q in you can iterate over retaining the order of the q in print is that this user answered the not pretty but you get the point already determined what you wanted to just a matter of contorting it to whatever data structure you happen to

 think that has any operator that mimics the functioning of the operator of you could use the equivalent of ternary operator iif in your make sure to read stephen post in the link i provided above which suggests a generic iif function that infers type requirements from the provided this becomes necessary because the iif function always returns an better option would be to create a function that performs this cast rather than trying to do it in one

 think that you can use exceptions for flow there a flipside of this creating exceptions is a costly because they have to create a stack so if you want to use exceptions more often than for just signalling an exceptional situation you have to make sure that building the stack traces negatively influence your best way to cut down the cost of creating exceptions is to override the method like throwable return an exception will have no stacktraces filled

 think the documentation of libxml2 is not pretty especially if you use the you can give some explanation what you miss in the no experience with the performance in i think the libxslt parser is pretty but probably because the have to the vm can also write your own xml tune it in the way where you need the always a bit of a how much time do i spent reading the documentation and examine how it and how much work is it to write my own xml libxml2 so it suits your needs might even be the open source solution but may cost the most

 think the question of whether or not to use code generation depends on what your goals are with the example of a data access layer is a good your problem with nhibernate is that you have to generate the domain classes if your domain classes map directly to the database then this is not a one of the strengths of nhibernate in this scenario is precisely that you can define your own domain and that they do not have to map precisely to the database that means you can tweak your db layer later on and the only code you have to change is the mapping if you used code probably have to tweak a lot more and the tweaks would not always be as straightforward as the tweaks to the mapping files would have

 think you are approaching the problem from a viewpoint that is less than are focusing on the compiler lack instead of focusing on the most probable answer to your main questions is the hardware support all that embedded hardware are noted for the customization of the hardware design memory interrupt my you should first spend some time with the hardware book for the learning the ins and outs of the device how it was designed and for what primary some were designed for fast memory some for fast some for type some for signal the type of microcontroller dictates the assembler instructions they wrote for and that dictates what any compiler can do this is spend some time to look at the assembler as well it will tell you what the designers considered it will also tell you a lot about how much you can get from a microcontrollers support because the design really care about or fancy memory handling the it can be but you are often trying to pound a round peg in a square hole to get constructors and destructors and to work in the micro you have a c compiler for this consider it a a good c compiler is often than to create excellent embedded	
 think you are confused because of a with inside your loop to have every word printed on a different	
 think you are looking for a approach is well known among the porter stemmer is basically an affix stripping combined with a few substitution rules for those special stemmers deliver stems that are linguistically for both and can result in the stem of is not a real this if using those stems to improve search results in information retrieval comes with support for the porter for also devised a simple programming language for developing called are also stemmers for german available in a c generated from the snowball is also available on the along with a plain text explanation of the the german stemmer in looking for the corresponding stem of a word as you would find it in a along with information on the part of you should google for	
 think you are looking for the following all dependencies found by the compiler are if the dependencies of the input classes are not default value is	
 think you are tripping over the nature of latex plus if you look at 3 in this see the first run generates an auxiliary containing about citations other types the bibliography and the name of the the second run uses the information in auxiliary along with the contained in the bibtex create a file this contains a thebibliography with entries according to the bibliography what i think is happening is that your file still contains your placeholder if you remove the auxiliary you should be able to start over based on additional the problem was that you had a file with your still the second time that you ran you overrode the old file with the why the complete set of steps includes an initial a call and two think of it as a compiler and it might be more

 think you could do this to replace one slash at a time with an flag causes apache to restart the url rewriting process from the first if you have other rules that apply to the url before these remember that be invoked on every iteration as which may or may not be more would be to use an external program to handle the put this in your apache configuration file of the slashtouscore then need to create the executable script with the have to be a perl of any program with the same function will do and of course the filename can be whatever you as long as accessible to that none of this is	
 think you could fake it with double parens just as long you need the arguments	
 think you could get around this by using a generic list instead of an going to assume you use generics for one reason or need to tell the compiler what type is contained in the arraylist so it can serialize it since all it knows it that it contains this above your property and it should clear it replace with whatever class is contained in the	
 think you could try one of the wysiwig editors ones include you should be able to force it into and they will probably tidy up bad html for you i actually tied this technique myself

 think you it this does work as a css selector modern expressed in a javascript string literal you would naturally need another round of this work in jquery because its selector parser is not completely it uses this regex to parse the part of an being the group containing the opening which weirdly are allowed to be multiple opening or no opening quotes at the then can parse any until it hits the first ending the there is no provision for css special so you match an arbitrary string value in regex parsers the good news is you have to rely on jquery there are perfectly good dom methods you can in particular if do something with is many times simpler and faster than asking jquery to laboriously parse and implement your and you can use any value string you like without having to worry about escaping special	
 think you may be trying to run before you can the concepts in there probably require a little programming experience to start thrust of the article frankly poorly is that when you are programming you often encounter tasks that benefit from a declarative you should be able to express the intent of what you want to do and leave the implementation details to a a good example is querying a much more readable to be able to declaratively describe what you want to do and let some middleware figure out the best way to do sql and linq are 2 examples of a declarative mechanism for querying is a very interesting but honestly if you have no programming experience probably more of a 201 subject than a 101 get your basics down	
 think you may have mixed the do you need or wrapping is the one where lines that usually fit on screen due to their are shown on several consecutive lines on screen it is one in several lines hard to best to see in vim wrapping is set turn it determine where vim should wrap the text characters is usually a nice on the other hand is a completely different it is the one where vim folds several lines of code a into one line of it is useful for increasing readability of vim has several folding you can see all of them if you you are looking i think would syntax but i could be i recommend reading the help it is not and very	
 think you might find a possible solution	
 think you need jquery or javascript for you can indeed detect which form a user hits submit or even which submit button is hit case there are more than one submit button per the code you would for the you would simply check the name of the submit for php you can use images as submit then you can use the same name for all the submit buttons and just check their can also do this with normal submit buttons if every button has a unique more method is to combine post and get

 think you should bundle it since you are probably letting someone else pay for the bandwidth codeplex and sourceforge are nice also that makes the users life alot you can also just delete modules you need which makes the file a bit in our app on the first run it checks if all files exist and downloads the zend framework from zends on the first run you could download it from and use a php function to unzip it and place it in the appropriate that would be an alternative which would take a little time to do but would dramatically reduce the	
 think you should definitely expand the thought process to include some doubt for specific this should be a very very rare thing to say go for the global style sheets but refactor your css html in a way that pages have to have and if in the end a few lines of markup in the global who better to have it in a consistent place	
 think you should first convert the to a temporary list of as the other code here converts the strings over and over for each could also use nullable ints if keeping the around is after you sort the list and if necessary convert back to

 this area seems to be really fragmented and no clear or solution there are some worthy is really easy and effortless for getting a basic ui mockup up and it is free for one project is more of a ui mockup tool rather than for you can create ui screen mockups very quickly with a wide range of ui they have support for maintaining it is free a 5 min nag but also incorporates with eclipse and other is one of the best tools for ui prototyping and thus very recommend starting out with protoshare with their free if all you need are ui balsamiq is really the best free option out

 this i think is what you created two table value correlated subqueries to get the data based on the stored number in the inner join then i join them based on the store that way the distinct will but you might also be able to do the counts in the select part with using just correlated i was worried the distinct might not work distinct inner join as acp on inner join as from where as on inner join as from where and progress is not as on

 this is a it seems you are talking about most systems and have more detailed apis in order to figure out if the file exists when opening the you should do is make a call to access the as it will typically indicate through some sort of error that the file exist it truly in you would have to go through the layer and use the createfile api if that function returns an error of then you know that the file does not if it returns then you have a handle that you can point here is that it is a atomic which ultimately is what you are looking with the you can pass it to a filestream constructor and perform your work on the

 this particular i think that the weakest link your application is using md5 rather than the manner in which md5 is is that given that it is possible to generate such that because the is limited because there are any tricks to reduce the search is not necessarily this means that if you know you can generate such that this giving a valid in this case the message still remains the and p been if the attacker tries to forge message with a then it is highly unlikely that unless in which they would have the if they have the then that means that it matter if you used sha or since checking if v is equivalent to checking if that sha might take constant time longer to that affect the complexity of the on given the you really ought to just go ahead and use there is no sense in not using unless there is a serious drawback to using second thing is you probably store the password in your database in what you should store is a hash of the and then use in your the hash would be time and you could safely store in your an attacker stealing your database something like sql would still be able to forge i see any way around

 though i will focus on point i begin by giving my 2 cents on the whole issue of unless differences are big or usage is usually i bother about microseconds that when added amount to any visible difference to the i emphasize that i only care when considering called where i do have special performance considerations is on the way i design the application i care about about the use of about clever ways to call methods to make several calls or to try to make only one whether to pool connections or in fact i usually focus on raw but on i care if it runs better by a tiny slice of a nanosecond for a single but i care a lot to have the ability to load the system with big amounts of simultaneous users without noticing the said here goes my opinion about point i love anonymous they give me great flexibility and code the other great feature about anonymous methods is that they allow me to directly use local variables from the container method a not from an il of they spare me loads of code when do i use anonymous evey single time the piece of code i need needed if it is used in two different i like as a reuse so use a plain just like shoosh it good to have code in theory there are no performance differences as anonyms are not il of what i think about anonymous methods applies to lambda as the latter can be used as a compact syntax to represent anonymous assume the following public static void used to represent an anonymous foreach item in if receives an array of strings and for each one of it will call the method passed to if that method returns it will say you can call this method the following names return p you can also call it the following p p is no difference in il between the being that the one using the lambda expression is much more once there is no performance impact as these are all compiler tricks jit compiler just as i feel we are overusing anonymous i feel we are overusing lambda expressions to represent anonymous of the same logic applies to repeated do use regular there are other restrictions leading you back to anonymous methods or plain like out or ref argument other nice things about lambda expressions is that the exact same syntax need to represent an anonymous lambda expressions can also you take the following public static void used to represent an binaryexpression bexpr as if is a binary node type is left side is right side is if constantexpression right value of the right side is the slightly different the second parameter receives an expression and not a the way to call this method would p p is exactly the same as the call we made when creating an anonymous method with a the difference here is that we are not creating an anonymous but creating an expression it is due to these expression trees that we can then translate lambda expressions to which is what linq 2 sql for instead of executing stuff in the engine for each clause like the the the nice thing is that the calling syntax is the same whether creating an anonymous method or sending an

 true confession maybe just but sometimes practices for program on windows machines feels like changed more than data access still running and somewhere along the way just kind about where ms wanted me to store all my i controlled all the machines i coded so it really writing apps for the supporting win98se on i have to pay attention to all this reasons having to do mostly with easy migration to new not a big fan of using the registry for app settings i prefer using ini and have some older ini components that i use for the task open to suggestions to other if make this easier less i need to store app settings remembering option at least not alone in this for what is somewhat of a repeat albeit from a slightly different sounds like i can just use and store all data is this universally true across all windows flavors from win98se on if the best and when did that approach come into really looking is the easiest way to make this problem go away i just want one reliable way to grab data in any and all will the above accomplish approach for storing settings db files on various windows

 try not to comment the obvious however the modern techniques of documenting the code often force to break this consider the following returns the user string the function return end we need this longer that the function itself to know what it is supposed to no the code itself is clear enough and but unless we add the there will be problems with the documentation generators and i think that the answer to the question do we depend on the code we are going to when making a website i unsually put any for the standard parts of the because almost all of them follow the same check the parse the optionally get the do the something with the redirect the user such code is easily readable even after two or more the other we have a specialized code that solves a particular technical for example a kind of the complexity is we use some data the algorithm may move the data between them to perform a certain task if i see that the algorithm does not follow any popular i describe the used data its purpose and what operations are performed on them in order to complete the i also try to why the specified solution was i find the comment syntax useful internal and system functions that are not exposed but also should be briefly especially in complex code just to what they are actually why and what their arguments the alternative is to find all the occurences of them and i must also point that sometimes it is very hard to what is worth a couple of months ago i returned to a piece of code in one of my projects to add some extra suddenly i noticed a quite important condition and had no why i used i think it must have been something obvious while writing this but even the investigation help last comment practice i use is marking the end of the class and interface with its end helps me

 trying to do validation in a not the a binder is supposed to bind request parameters to your backing nothing a property editor converts strings to objects and vice versa it is not designed to do anything other you need to consider separation of concerns trying to shoehorn functionality into an object that was never meant to do anything more than convert a string into an object and vice might consider breaking up your ssn object into validateable fields that are easily bound basic objects like this way you can use a validator after binding to verify that the ssn is or you can set an error with a property you throw an spring converts it to a type mismatch error because what it is the string match the type that is all that it a on the other can do you can use the spring bind tag to bind to nested as long as the ssn instance is populated it must be initialized with for you truly want to persist on this have your property editor keep a list of errors if it is to throw an add it to the list and then throw the illegalargumentexception and rethrow if because you can construct your property editor in the same thread as the it will be threadsafe if you simply override the property editor default behavior you need to find the hook it uses to do and override it do the same property editor registration doing now in the same so that you can keep the reference to your and then at the end of the you can register errors by retrieving the list from your editor if you provide a public once the list is retrieved you can process it and add your errors

 ui is time consuming and because it involves not just visual or sound but more importantly interaction a good api is always interaction model meaning it puts minimal constraints on actual localisation and info the main driver behind this is encapsulation and code a result it is impossible to extract enough information from api alone to construct a good user interface tailored to a specific case of api there are ui generators that normally produce screens based on a given needless to say that such generated are not very for frequent users with demands for higher ui nor are they particularly easy to learn in case of a larger system since they really communicate system image or interaction sequence takes a lot of effort to create a good ui because it needs to be designed according to specific user needs and not because of some mundane conversion task that can be fully speed the process of building ui up and mitigate risks it is possible to suggest either involving ui professionals or learning more about the job there is no shortcut or magic so to speak that will produce a quality ui based entirely and only on an api without lots of additional info and also see an excellent is good ui design so hard for some that has some very insightful and valuable plug for own by karl

 used but i used svn and bazaar is similar in philosophy to so i can answer you in general advantage of the so called distributed version control systems is that the repo and the code are together on your and you are not dependent on a remote repo for every developer has a his own copy of the repo to which he commits you can check previous without being connected to the officiality of repository is granted by virtue of human not technical in you only have one which is you and all the other people commit in you commit to your own and another developer to his own and each of you can push his modifications to the officially designed repo when he clear advantage is that operations in a dvcs are blazing svn becomes incredibly slow when you start having a lot of stuff in your this can become annoying very the minus dvcs are more difficult to but you can use a dvcs as a centralized vcs if you

 variant of option 2 hybrid of 1 and may make after polymorphism is the standard solution to are as but need to behave differently in situation a method would probably tie the model to the ui too but presumably the different renderings you want at the ui level reflect semantic or behavioural differences at the model could those be captured in a for instead of an outright could it be a to which a and b return different values but it is still up to the ui to decide how to translate that into a your more general of can we handle behaviour that we or allow to be accessed polymorphically via the base for example if the base class under our your options are probably option the visitor pattern or a helper in both cases you are effectively farming out the polymorphism to an external entity in option the ui the presenter or which performs an instanceof check and does different things depending on whether a b or in visitor or the helper the new given your visitor is probably overkill if you were not to change the base class to accommodate it be possible to implement it i so suggest a simple class called something like abstract class renderer public static renderer if instanceof return new return new public abstract color implementations of arenderer and brenderer per your ui encapsulates the type checking and bundles the code up into reasonably classes with clear without the conceptual overhead of if your hierarchy or function set is more complex than what shown visitor could well be more but many people find visitor hard to get their heads around and i would tend to avoid it for simple situations but your mileage may

 was avoiding writing what may seem like another thread on but bear with hopefully like others still am not satisfied or clear on the best approach to take given trends and new emerging technologies when it comes to selecting an architecture to use for enterprise suppose i am seeking mass community opinion on the direction and architectural implementation would chose when building an enterprise application utilising most facets of technology and what direction you would i better make this about me and my in fear of this being too vague i would like to improve my architecture to improve and would really like to hear what you guys think given the list of technologies i am about to and all best practices and architectural patterns you would suggest are welcome and if you have created a solution before for a similar type any pitfalls or caveats you may have hit or is a list of technologies adopted in my latest yep pretty much everything except wpf client by smart to by sql server and additional components to injection management testing currently have this running in an adopting a design pattern utilising sure of formal and the repository most of my structure was adopted from suppose i am more or less happy with most of my tiers really just the dal which i am a bit uneasy i these are the real questions i have faced with my current have a big question mark on if i should have a custom data access layer given the use of linq to should i perform linq to sql directly in my layer or in a dal in a repository should you create a new instance of your db context in each repository method call or one in the class you believe we can truly use poco old clr when using linq to i would love to see some examples as i encountered problems and it would have been particularly handy with the wcf work as i obviously be carrying l2s objects across the an mvc project by itself quite clearly displays the design pattern you should by keeping view logic in the controller calling methods and of course your data access in the but would you drop the facet for larger particularly where the data access is what approach would you take to get your for hearing me out and would love to see sample on architectures and how it is as said i have seen i am yet to really go through oxite but just thought it would benefit myself and additional question in dal bullet design practices for architecture with linq to sql can we truly use design pattern to

 was waiting to see if you got an answer on this one as something interested in as you tell you what i know probably not so useful but it might get you used something based on the portal in a previous project there are some license costs involved depending on the deployment scenario and it turned out to be quite slow and and rather tricky to customise the default for the ext toolset is for the ui to be built entirely from not from and while it was possible to coerce it into working on top of existing it seemed more difficult than it needed to that it worked well in the and with the paid version the support is very also implemented a widget portal screen based on which worked really well the basic implementation was very quick and easy but writing the code to save and load portal settings took more time than i would have i were doing a similar project i think evaluate it looks ok from a cursory glance and open source built with so the core should be solid and the slightly uneven animations on the demo version should be easy to sort out assuming it uses the standard sortable it has functionality to portal settings too by the looks of so it should mean less hand coding that side of

 was wondering about the basis of the question because i thought it was easy to however as soon as you go it becomes clear that its actually a good question because pretty much the first thing on the page is this specification defines the features and syntax for the extensible stylesheet language a language for expressing it consists of two language for transforming xml vocabulary for back in the real xslt is also what most people will assume you mean by is a means for transforming xml documents into something else that something else more often than not being another well structured document probably also formatted as xml used xslt to render xml to csv and on the other hand is about formatting about laying out content on a page or a sequence of pages in a fairly strict its useful because it allows you to manage content that is spread across multiple its relatively straightforward to specify the format of a page even and odd including etc and have your content flow into one would therefore take a load of data an xml format and then use xslt to convert that data into a document consisting of that in turn is rendered using an appropriate tool in say pdf for print or other means of use case i have is to take a pile of tabular export that data as render that into and from there to pdf which goes to a printer who turns said pdf into a 500 page one specifies in the that one wants page page breaks in specific that there is a table of contents and an index based on particular and the rendering process handles filling in the page numbers across the a bit less confused

 way of doing this may be to use mocking and check an expectation that dispose was called using void var disposable d use constructor injection to pass in mock var classundertest new disposable the method needs to create and then dispose of the then i would use and inject a factory class that is able to create the mock example below uses stub on factory as not what we are testing for in this void var factory var disposable f disposable d use constructor injection to pass in mock var classundertest new factory	
 way seen to share session state across different applications is to use one of the other options for storing session state unfortunately i have access to iis 7 at the but assuming it is how you configure it in iis management up properties for the applicable virtual tab edit management state defaults to but you can change it for your various application to use the same sql server	
 way that springs to my mind is to use a generation number for the give the todo table a column called generation and associate with it a global and persistent generation number best to put this in a table in the time an update or insert is made the generation number is incremented and put into the generation number column for the updated or inserted the records are first read from the db and put on the web page the current generation number is also retrieved and cached locally put into a javascript subsequent ajax driven reads use a where clause which filter only records with a generation number greater than the locally cached generation this ensures only new updates and deletes are the locally cached generation number is then are a bit more one way to do it is to tombstone deleted records for a limited say 21 you have bit column called tombstone and a datetime when a record is deleted the column has generation number set in the same way as for an insert or the tombstone bit is and the datetime is set to the current time using the ajax request can then select records with the tombstone flag set and remove them from the client side if the client is coded so that after every 20 mins a full page or an ajax call that gets each and every is enforced then a db job can run every minute and clean up the tombstoned records older than 20 you actually need to separately persist the generation you can the sql function max over the generation	
 way things are going to be a moot question mentioned merb and rails are going to be the same the merb and rails core teams are already at work on achieving i know if still planning on a release a by railsconf in but definitely happening this dead set on using an orm other than for you might start with merb now and update when right merb is generally accepted to provide a better framework for varying components than looks like a brilliant solution for a web app that has low interface complexity and somewhat lower code than would be normal for implementing straightforward restful apis would be one great less convinced about its value when any quantity of html is even less so when templating gets with rails hence merb now sitting on top of no reason not to include baby sinatra apps into the they can live blog post that discusses that very

 way to solve your problem is to use a win32 api called this function to connect to a unc path with not to map a will allow you to connect to a remote even if it is not on the same and even if it has a different username and you have used wnetuseconnection you will be able to access the file via a unc path as if you were on the same the best way is probably through the administrative built in is some sample code that uses for the you should pass null for the lplocalname and the dwtype should be the lpremotename should be

 we can give a name to a that means that the language already has the necessary support for recursion built into that the second method given in your question involves changing the value of a variable after it has been making it not functional is only necessary if your system of functional calculus have a notion of a function that can refer to its own definition by name before the definition is completely has two ways to do that initially defining the function variable as null and declaring an ordinary named method far the preferred	
 we finally got around to looking at this and we ended up with the a new httphandler that kicks inn for all requests in format the forward the request to the path the real proxy is and cache the result from the built in handler for a set to do the we then need to do is to specify the cacheable paths in our scriptmanagers instead of the real path of the flags it as a bug but it works like a

 we have a structure like this to describe a 4x4 type type type type type type type type type type all you have is euler that is an angles representing the and roll and a point in 3d space for the you can calculate the and look note that and look are just the but since this is a i find it easier to name it the simplest way to apply your roations to the camera matrix is to build a series of rotation matrices and multiply our camera matrix by each rotation good reference for that is you have applied all the needed you can set the vector pos to the position in the world before you apply the you need to take the inverse of its this is what you are going to multiply your modelview matrix by before you start drawing for the matrix class the inverse is calculated like orthinv return with all our matrix constuction out of the you would be doing something like cameramatrix rollrotation pitchrotation this

 we need to know what you already know about the you have a username and an old what else do you do you have an email do you have data regarding the favorite you have a password and working email you need to add two fields to your user table it is a database a date called and a string you have the email when someone requests a password you update the user table as some number of some random string of characters you send an email to the user at that has requested a new password for user account at website if you did request this password follow this that link does not work you can go to and enter the following into the you did not request a password you may ignore this yada coding this script needs a if the var update passed on the the form just asks for the username and email if update is not it asks for email and the id code sent in the you also ask for a new password of verify the new you verify the email and the id code all that the request has not and that the two new passwords if you change the password to the new password and clear the password reset fields from the user also be sure to log the user any login related cookies and redirect the user to the login the field is a password that only works on the password reset potential you could remove from the has request a password reset for an account at this email thus making the username something only the user knows if the email is i start off that way because if someone is attacking the they already know the this added obscurity stops attacks of opportunity in case someone malicious happens to intercept the for your the random it need to be extremely any guid generator or even is where salt is something on the user record like timestamp account was it has to be something the user you need this just to keep your database no more than a week is really necessary but at least 2 days since you never know how long an email delay might since the email could be delayed by ip address is only useful for not for if you want to log do otherwise you need see that covers good

 web application is not suited at all to be running something at a fixed if there are no requests coming there is no code running in the and if the application is inactive for a while the iis can decide to shut it down completely until the next request comes some applications it at all important that something is run at a specific only that it has been run if that is the case for your application then you could just keep track of when the table was last and for every request check if enough time has passed for the table to be polled you have access to administer the there is a scheduler in sql it can run stored and even start processes if you have permission is very unlikely on a shared you need the code on a specific and you access the server to schedule it or run it as a or use the sql server simply not

 what programming tools should are there any was the only language to come and even it was in two dialects and want to look at the fred fish collection or aminet for more as finding commercial compilers will be i limited to plain text are there ides and debugging pretty much back to ides are not readily i would look at something like dme macro also available on the fred fish collection or aminet it provides some basic macro construction facilities that will no tools are already can this are there free fred or like to learn a traditional could you reccomend it was written by chris a little but it should provide you with all that you need to get including the proper bindings and the language is compiled and runs at speeds comparable to should i use to compile language you or lattice c were the c compilers of the time you can find good with manx tending towards 16bit and lattice towards there were a few tiny there is 68k assembly neato instruction set a pascal possibly as well as dice free c but looking for something could you suggest tools i use to debug the suggested commercial tools are far and few going to have to dig through the public domain archives to find there any libraries i should aware such as gui libraries are all built is the name of the library that provides basic windowing will provide you with and will provide you with support for handing the unique approach to before you get that want to look at which was the heart soul of the it provides linked list message passing io and was heavily throughout the if you understand understand the innards of the rest of the in mind that the state of the system will look more like an embedded game as there will be no memory smp all of these things could not easily be added due to design constraints that were introduced just before the first amiga i seem to recall that the issue was surrounding how it would handle multiple processors and memory protection given that the entire microkernel runs in a cpu but not the magic number is which is a memory that address is the pointer to the exec is not only a microkernel but also a and with it you can bootstrap into the rest of the system via libraries that could not be located will automatically be loaded from disk via this is how the amiga dealt with the issue of portable code all of the code was written using offsets into a pointer to the of a library and there were no fixed other than address every library has a call table of 6 bytes per entry jump that then vectors off into the correct entry it was easy to write your own provided you had the correct format for your device drivers the structure of libraries and used the same concept to provide default if the names are slightly this information is off the top of my head from nearly 20 years things to running workbench from the winuae that was the last great i can access from my windows hard but want to go as much as like to code and compile it workbench if running winuae in a1200 sure if that the model of hardware it was a good budget but try setting it for a3000 if that was a nice machine before commodore had an application installed called it a if emacs is your i would look at some of the native and very a similar amiga aware that you can code with c but i want to learn a draco is for it has most of the bindings for compiles and officially a language given tied to a specific hardware very let everyone know how it turned

 work with but in there are differences between these two syntaxes for referring to controls on a first causes access to create a hidden property that returns the the result of this is checking of references to second uses the default collection of the current form and does not provide assume that vba works the same in adps as in so why not try converting the offending control references to bang instead of this would eliminate the checking and might allow the project to compile without having to reconstruct it that i think i would then try deleting the control removed the hidden property and add the control back with a new name and then compact know if adps can be but if they it should be decompiled as this should remove the problematic hidden property definition permanently and if the cause of the you should be able to revert to the dot operator and get checking what seen too many corruption problems with the dot operator and always use the bang in all my ok with not having checking of control with the bang you lose automatic intellisense in some cases is a blessing as intellisense can get in your way in some but you can invoke a different intellisense list with this list is not limited to the control but once you start you get the usual autocomplete that jumps you to the appropriate location in the

 worked on medium and large sized projects and i say ever seen risk reviews done less than once per fortnight two in some cases they were performed once per month twice a month would be my key to risk management is to allow enough time to pass before you project this gives a project manager enough time to evaluate whether contingencies and migitation are valid and to allow the team time to decide whether risks are more or less likely and whether risk mitigation techniques have lessened the impact of any recorded also need to allocate enough time for individuals who have been assigned ownership of one or more to evaluate and report back on mitigation in other strength is through routine review but enough time must pass for it to be obviously this the sort of task which should be constrained to a rigid if it becomes you could schedule risk reviews closer together to suit the needs of the project if move to weekly reviews and then scale back during stabilization important thing is not to let the or to stop new i missed another aspect of the how to handle the risk to the team other stakeholders a basic say that you need the ability to record risk items and to weigh them according to probability and estimated and also to be able to assign them to various team members version control is critical you do this will vary depending on the nature of your there are plenty of ways to track the information for example which can be emailed to external a sharepoint list someone a must take ownership of the process so it get might want to avoid email since it has a habit of not being stored or recorded

 working copy is in a home if the svn server runs as a different say then the hook script will run as it makes sense that one user cannot modify or read another files unless the permission settings on the files are such that this is should not share working copies among multiple if you really then simply giving permission to each user is not you would also need to make sure that none of the users create files which are inaccessible to other to achieve that you would need to write wrapper scripts for the svn commands that set the proper or give all involved users the ability to act as one specific user through

 working on an application that has a data publication mecanism that i designed it allows one master instance of the app to feed data to many subscriber this is implemented by loading the data into a set of temporary import tables that have the schema on the the merge process uses these import tables to do its whole publication thing is working it is performed outside of nhibernate using for batch sets of stored procedures for merging autogenerated by a custom we only have an http link available between to download the we connect directly to the master sql problem i face is visually showing the diff to the user before they actually merge the new in the like to have nhibernate load our business object directly from these temporary import we do this without having to maintain two sets of almost identical mapping files our last we were building up business objects using custom code that would load from these import it would only load simple not handling this sucks big time from a point of mapping same entity to many

 world is powerfull and full featured i think today obstacles are peoples this to say that using needs to take changes in in the way of thinkng architectures and answer you execution depends on more possible to fully customize the to take advantages of various features deffered future queries executed in a future multiple and last but not session management involves in this execution is based on concepts like and lazy this means that queries are executed against the database just qhen you perform some like accessing to methods of the nhibernate session like another example of deferred execution is with using of where just when you access to certain queries are queries are as i said beforre queries executed in a future ayende speaks well about queries are queries that can be together and executed in one time avoiding multiple roundtrips to the and this could be a very cool this is another chapter to but take in mind that if you manage well your or let nhibernate engine to manage well the sometime not needed to go to the dn to obtain all the tools like nhibernate generates queries for and parametrized queries are managed well with parameters even depending on the underlying db engine and conseguently db dialect you clear that frameworks like most of the use reflection at but needed to mention the multiple reflection optimization are see for example clear that or maybe all the time direct code could be but just in the in the big picture this could involve in more mistakes and about or better usefull to understand what you mean when talk about temp tables and temp in terms as as i support natively temp in the sense of runtime but this could be done because nhibernate permit to create object mapping at so a mechanism of temp data could be implemented using that hope i provided an usefull sorry for my bad

 would advocate the refactoring approach did we get here in the first why the individual methods can throw the exception after doing with myobject and that exception can then be safely since the exception escapes the myobject must be in an unknown safe to ignore the surely it must be the wrong way to communicate that something went wrong in each maybe each method that needs to do some logging on if you use static you can pass a logger to each

 would choose the create an outer class and name it if the particular class is used in a public the only argument for not including it outside the class is namespace the inner class is quite frankly annoying in because you must constantly prefix the type name with the name of the as once public the only motivation for donig this is reduction of namespace but if your namespace is so big that the inventorysaveargs class is making it too big you probably need to break up your namespace	
 would consider migrating the ms access portion to ms sql is possible but not sure of the issues related to that would handle a lot of the multi user issues that ms access had few issues converting other ms access applications to ms sql end stays in ms and the tables are linked to the ms sql db through so low and you get there is something technological that forces you to use ms the easiest thing to do would be to just create an odbc link to the oracle table through ms that way you are only updating it one i also question the decision to move the table from oracle to ms more trusting of oracle dbs right off the start and ms is not known to be highly performing over add more memory to the oracle give it a faster tightest bottle neck is not going to be the database going to be your so you are moving the problem from one server to another and you are adding to the network congestion by having to synchronise the ms access table with the oracle

 would declare your main jquery scripts within the master as you would then any page specific js files could be loaded within the content controls that reference the head a better option would be to look into the and controls these can provide you with a lot more control over the way your js files are served to the you would place a scriptmanager control in you master and add a reference to the jquery core code in in your page that requires some custom js or a jquery you can scriptmanager allows you to do things like control where on the page scripts are rendered with better after by setting it to	
 would definitely advocate to have qa review not only the releases that go to the but also some intermediate maybe every two weeks or once per is in accordance with the principle to check your product as early in the development process as if you are only doing it when you are releasing a you are doing it too i would give them the debug with asserts enabled for those early you have an assert in the code that you have an either the code is or the either you want qa to test for	
 would definitely favour the 2nd approach of overloaded first approach blurs the definition of the method as it no longer has a single this in turn increases the of the making it more difficult for someone not familiar with it to understand the second approach each method has a clear each method is and some additional code which needs to be duplicated into both this can be out into a separate and each overloaded method could call this external would go a step further and each method to indicate the differences between the this will make the code more	
 would definitely go with something closer to the second it does seem like more messages passed back and but if your application grows and you will be happy that built the application with small where is the logic to handle mundane tasks like switching between executing them and processing the data for algorithms operate on some kind of input or starting you would get this from your data access you need seed data or initialization what about saving your results to file and retrieving them for review i would think that you need to do this once your application expect that at first you will use file based if feeling up to later you can upgrade to a if you code against an abstracted data persistence you have to change business logic later to support the change from file to should use the strategy pattern to implement your this will allow you to change the implementation of your solver from genetic algorithm to your other algorithms without having to change the business logic for each business layer will see a isolver that takes and you will call you should be able to switch between the different versions without having to change your business layer logic closed the only difference in the way the business logic should interact with the algorithms should be in the and even you should consider using a factory

 would expect foreach to work nominally faster in some and the about same in except in cases where the items are an actual array in which case the performace difference is it is implemented on top of an it be more efficient than a straight depending on unlikely to be less for if someone exposed a balanced tree as both indexable and then foreach will be decently this is because each index will have to independently find the referenced while an enumerator has the context of the current node to more efficiently navigate to the next you have an actual then it depends on the implementation of the language and class whether foreach will be faster for the same as indexing is a literal memory as then for should be marginally faster since avoiding a function if indexing is an indirection just like a then it should be the that being i find it hard to find a case for generalization this is the last sort of optimization you should be looking even if there is a performance problem in your if you have a performance problem that can be solved by changing how you you really have a performance you have a because someone wrote either a really crappy or a really crappy

 would not rely on the because i am doubtful the c or standards would make explicit this but it makes sense that the compiler does it also makes sense that it exhibits this behavior even in the absence of any optimization specified to the there is no in string literals in c or are and thus when you are in a sense the string to a you do away with the attribute of the if you try to manipulate be caught at rather than at is actually a good reason to use char when assigning string literals to a variable of

 would recommend implementing this as a with string keys mapping to custom flashitem the flashitem will simply contain the object or string storing plus a boolean possibly called which should be set to true when you insert a new item into the each page load you then iterate the set any isnew true items to and delete any items where isnew is already that should give you a to flash

 would say it looks blurry kind of like as if you were viewing this on osx or i too agree that this is unacceptable together with of where font rendering is awful as while microsoft keeps on promising to fix this for 4 fact many of us need to stuff which leads to the following can ignore common sense and just ship the software making fonts bigger and what have so long as your customer the my you are working with you can wait until some future release until this is fixed for good look at how long wpf has been everyone knew about this problem guess what it been you are working with you get the perfect font rendering an algorithm that is even marginally better than what vista does face is same goes for the algorithm for an ideal cleartype is a mixture of judicious use of subpixel antialiasing and using font hinting i have done and have even had fun optimizing it for simd and the it a serious investment of your i tried this but it should oh if you want to kill the go having said i think provided you know taking advantage of hardware guess what trying to say is there a solution for winforms the best algorithm but there a solution for i wish someone would prove me

 would seem like the perfect solution for a kiosk type assumedly the kiosk machines are going to need have minimal maintenance done to them and the web deployment approach for apps is the best most mature one big advantage of using silverlight is that if you have any business logic in type languages that needs to run client side it can usually be easily ported to compile against the silverlight runtime you may not even need to change a single line depending on which framework libraries you the only thing that could limit the viability of using a browser based app in this situation is if you have some additional hardware access requirements such as a custom ticket credit card reader in those cases be fighting the browser sandbox to get them to

 would suggest for turbogears they have done a fantastic job of integrating best of python assuming you are developing moderately complex business solutions in tg2 or some other framework say even though these frameworks supports wsgi does that mean one who is using these frameworks have to learn in most cases answer is i mean good have this knowledge no knowledge is probably is more useful in cases want to use some middleware or some other component which is not provided as part of the standard stack for authkit with tg or without are doing some is good but think of handling your database at the end of exposing validations in such cases django like frameworks do it all for

 would suggest having an init be method on your you would run this method on your application start for each of your in that case you can wrap it in try catch and act your throwing exceptions in places like shared constructor is bad idea you really catch hard to predict when the init will be called case you specify add either isinitialized field that would be checked and an exception thrown when calling that requires it can get tedious other option i would go for might be far from your current in many ioc tools they use concept of startable you specify an interface with a start method and the ioc will make sure the method runs at specified time likely when application is you would do your error handling in your method and bubble up whatever wrapped exception with all the detailed could elaborate on this but i have feeling not really the way you would	
 would suggest iptables for this put a rule in the iptables that wherever the destination port is the port number of your apache machine and the source ip is the ip address of critix the linux machine should drop that this way would solve your problem provided there are no other applications hosted on the apache of your machine which ought to be open for all an example of the perspective rule could be input 1 should solve your once you replace by its proper

 would suggest the datetime field rather than the autoincrement simply because it will not only serve as an effective sort it also preserves information that you may well want to if you want the most recent first sort using the date and a order by you retrieve the you can retrieve it as a datetime and modify it using you can use as suggested by mdresser if you just wish to show the date or if you wish to show the time as you can also use sql to convert it into a string before retrieving you look in see the various conversion codes is the code used that can be used to translate the date in various you may want to use an autoincrementing field for your application for reasons other than your expressed need to sort wall they are easy to use just mark the field as an if using sql server dbs are as far as using them in your just think of the field as an int field that you never have to why would you use a perhaps the most straightforward reason is so that they give you have an easy way to identify each for if you permit people to alter or delete their wall the field is ideal as it gives you a way to easily look up each record record will be assigned its unique you might put an next to the record like stackoverflow does and make it a call back with the uid note that you should set up your primary key on the uid field if be doing you find them useful for this then you could also sort by the i would still store the date so that you can provide date and time feedback as to when an entry was made on the wall but this would no longer be your indexed or sorted

 would the one hand there is application specific configuration data that is needed for the app to ip addresses to connect which folders to use for what sort of files and non trivial per user i put in a config ini format for simple xml if it gets more the other hand there is trivial per user settings window positions and to avoid cluttering the config files some users will want to edit so few and clearly arranged entries are a i like to put those in the registry conservative defaults being set in the app if no settings in the registry can be mainly do it like i store config files inside the usually in i like the default of that level of detail and complexity is counterproductive for most small to medium sized disagree with the example of of not storing recently used files in the imo this is exactly the volatile sort of user specific information that can be stored example of what to do is very

 would use a binary tree if you want to be able to efficiently find something in a sorted just the same as in any other data structure choice is important in any it become less important in higher level except to the degree that the higher level language provides large libraries that incorporate thoughtful intelligent design that handles this for in which case you have to design the data structure but you do have to know which data structure to java collections framework is extensive and but if you make use of the wrong collections your performance will some data structures are more than memory is cheap and modern languages will manage memory for but if you are handling huge sets of then data structures will matter if you can make something more

 wrote a blog post which has a sample project that you can download here code basically uses aes for encryption of binary data and then rsa encrypts the key and the iv using an as long as the private key certificate is the key and iv can be and then in turn the aes encrypted data can be decrypted could set up your certificate stores so that the only has access to the public key while the has access to the private allows you to encrypt using different key and iv each time and avoid hardcoding which i believe is more there should be nothing in your source code that would easily allow someone to decrypt your data and if your system was ever you would only need to swap out the certificates with new no need to recompile the application with new hardcoded sample code may be slightly different from your intended but i think the technique and some of the code might be useful to

 wrote a linked list implementation for my java class earlier this this is a generic class called we now have to write out the merge sort algorithm for a instead of creating a new list implementation that takes i decided to just reuse the generic list i had created problem is how do i compare two generic wont let me do something like my question is their a way to implement some sort of comparison function that will work on any type of i tried the string one two remove head takes care of list else if compareto returns 0 or is lower equal to so safe to update the wont even work i tested with the numbers 6 and the above adds 12 to the result private first new second new if return int middle set first half to full then remove the get the splitted first second return result new lets force tostring to compare stuff since generics are a string one two remove head takes care of list else if compareto returns 0 or is lower equal to so safe to update the return entire llist class can be found elements in a generic

 wrote a winmm library wrapper library that exposes waveout and wavein classes for the purpose of recording and playing raw audio works but in order to follow the operating system specs on how to handle the finished i added a thread that unprepares the buffers and frees the i also got all of the synchronization so that the classes are solid and there seems to be a rare issue where i add a buffer to the waveout device and the operating system returns a success but if the device is reset immediately the os does not mark the buffer as finished and return it to the seems that it is loosing the the problem keeping track of the count of individual buffers sent to the device and blocking joining the function to the thread that cleans them or known this does not seem to happen on a quad core in but does happen on my dual core in xp totally willing to expose the full source once i get it uploaded and propery licensed on if that would help posted library to is an idea of what causes the partial class mainview private wavein wavein new private waveout waveout new public waveformat format new tweaking these values affects the internal buffering setting too small of a queuesize with too small of a will cause buffer which will sound like choppy void datareadyeventargs if lock we have to check for null after the because waveout may have been inside another if private void formclosedeventargs if lock wavein if lock waveout library

 wrote this before your clarifying comment so it probably quite is not sure if a lookup table approach is possible or if you really need arbitrary then take advantage of the a solution is i believe that the following is what you are looking for is something like the it probably contains bugs in edge but it does compile and work as expected at least for positive making it really work is an exercise for the convert a numerical string of base a printable binary int int generates a printable binary representation of an input from an arbitrary the input number is passed as the character string the input string consists of from the ascii character set letter characters may be in either upper or lower the number of characters from the input string which consumed by this the output string is placed newly allocated storage which is pointed to by upon an error is signalled by returning const int char int rc char char unsigned long num if then we have some numbers int numdig rc we have this many base we need this many base 2 digits if return return the buffer outp make sure it is nul terminated while fill it in from lsb to msb num return

 you answered as to which platform take a stab at aix for need to have a look at the to get the specific cause but usually because aix has run out of shared memory has a total of 16 shared memory of which 7 are available for the the amount actually used by your database can be calculated with a formula too complicated for me to remember without looking it up in the troubleshooting a real possibility that a database will use 6 leaving just seen situations where that happens then a request happens at the same time as a stored these need a shared memory segment if the begins the stored procedure will fail as you are ways to fix this are to free up segments by doing one or more memory mapped the segment usage by the need that formula but i think it involves buffer heap sizes and lock off if not

 you be able to return a list of anonymous types unless you cast them to and have the signature define the return type as suitable your other issue is that the subquery for state will actually return an instead of a single entry can use the extension method with ef to get the first matching although if you have the foreign key relationship the model should have setup an navigation property for the state as well and you should be able to use the property attached instead of a so if you would like to have this as a method call that returns a list of objects you will have to create a type that represents the transform or downcast to otherwise you could do it at the form level all depends on your where you are attempting to bind the var results from r in select state state not hostaddress timestamp return like i said the other alternative is to either create a class for the transform or bind the list directly to the class public string state public string hostaddress public datetime timestamp just add the class to the ala new and change the method signature to reflect the class and remove the cast in the

 you both threads to see the results of changing the private or is it perfectly ok with you if both threads get the but when one thread changes a private the other thread see that why i in your you could take the object from cache and then clone or copy it before returning as a each thread would have its own copy of the and that copy would have the state that was in the cached object at the time they asked for no 2 threads would ever share the exact same because making a copy for each that fits your then you can avoid having to lock the object will need synchronization on the factory method itself though which you also need in your current careful with the idea of a if you have a graph of objects and you only do a shallow wind up with references that are still shared across forcing you to need synchronization this idea of makes best sense if the object is a very simple object without a lot of references to other

 you have foo foo return call it foo but the problem is that now is a dangling because the temporary object created by the call to gets freed after bar the detailed execution sequence here foo is is called with a reference to the temporary returns the that bar has returned the temporary foo is reference is now dangling as the object was if you had foo declared return your call not be accepted by when you pass a temporary object to a you can only take it by const reference or as a this is part of the language	
 you have here is an arbitrary and to parse it what you really want is a lexer you can write a grammar file that described your syntax and then use the lexer to generate a recursive parser from your a lexer even a recursive is not really trivial although it is a useful exercise in programming but you can find a list of ruby in this email message is available as a standard module of ruby so i suggest you concentrate on that even if its manual is not really easy to follow and it requires familiarity with

 you have two that you want to ignore a file that changed and that you want to add a bunch of files to subversion at solve the first problem you should use the previous suggestion propedit enter the name of the file into the editor that comes up on the environment this will most likely be or nano by make sure to save your changes to this file or it solve the second just loop over the files in your working copy via svn add in a bash equivalent terminal emulator it add something already under version control and you can safely ignore the warnings it gives the better solution would be to write a quick script to check if something is in svn first and only add it if but i think for what doing it might be a waste of add the root directory of your project and after checking to make sure happy with the the commit command will find all your changes the ones in and send them off to your

 you just want to give a different name to the association just use the property page for the association and rename the parent child that will change the name of the in the the downside of using a separate property in a partial class is that linq be able to use it when generating queries essentially be forced to always get the entities before you can use the related properties on the by renaming you allow linq to use the related properties in constructing the query which can result in a more efficient for if you want to get entities where a related entity has a particular property using the attribute decorated entity will allow linq to generate the sql to pull just those matching values from the with the naive property implementation simply references the underlying relation in effect renaming you will be forced to first get all then do the filtering in your

 you mean to use and to refer to the same stepping out on a limb because i have a ton of experience with but do this the same way that do it in or by copying the remaining array elements down into their new that is sorted its contents are valid indices for the code would be something like the untested code bother copying any elements below the first selected writeindex readindex selectionindex if if the read pointer is currently at a selected then bump it up until past selected readindex remove the tail of the your remove algorithm still suffers from the flaw that as you remove items in you break the correspondence between the indices in and those in see try adding 3 then doing and then hit it will start by removing the 1st file in the list now what the 2nd and 3rd files in the list are at indices 0 and the next value taken from is 1 but what had been the file is at index so the former file gets spliced out of the leaving the former 2nd file and at index more see that this implementation only removes every other file in the is why my javascript code uses a and a to copy the entries in the skipping the over the indices that are to be this algorithm avoids the problem of losing correspondence between the array does need to be coded carefully to guard against various edge i tried some javascript code what i wrote it worked for suspect that the problem in your original test case the 2nd then adding is since only shown part of your i tell whether the array indices and the data in and are always going to match up i suspect that the problem is that they even if you fix the problem with using by adjusting the array index values still an algorithm in the general the array copy algorithm is

 you need to do is nullify all the pointers to the object you just the idea of pointers is that there will be more than one pointer storing the address of the same if there is little reason to use a bare and so the pattern trying to capture is not very useful but you are far from the first person to try as other answers have the only way to deal with pointers is to carefully control access to title of your question is absolutely a good reason for a pointer identifies a location that stores an object of a specific a pointer to a pointer gives you the ability to change what object a pointer points new class derives from and so does my suppose the compiler allowed you to do expected that to but if it then we would now have a pointer that in fact pointers to an instance of who says those two types are this is a very frequent misunderstanding it crops up repeatedly here for other especially with regard to and in

 your dlls to be you need to protect all shared data structures that multiple threads in one process could access concurrently there is no difference here between writing code for a dll writing code for an multiple processes there is no risk in concurrent as each process gets its own data segment for the so variables with the same name are actually different when seen from different it is actually much more difficult to provide data in a dll that is the same from different you would basically need to implement the same things you would use for data exchange between that a dll is special in that you get notifications when a process or a thread attaches to or detaches from a see the documentation for the callback for an and for an example how to use this in a so if your threads are not completely independent from each other no shared data is then you will need some shared data structures with synchronized the various notifications may help you with properly setting up any data structures in your your dlls allow for completely independent execution of the exported also do check out the note that for them and sections are not but maybe the thread notifications can help you there as

 your implementation is pretty close to the the classic example of a the only issue i see is the role of blockinfo is being changed in between the steps then your implementation is what you need to look at the wikipedia article i point is being changed between and mouseup so it has to be a parameter of a abstract blockinfo is not being changed between the steps then you have several things to the class implementing parseddatahandler is initializing any part of the blockinfo structure then i would separate that out and make it a private member of the class and just have blockinfo pass in the initialization data that is external to the parsing blockinfo is being modified by beginblock and passed to the subsequent routines then you should clone store it internally in the class implementing then eliminate it from the parameter you need blockinfo afterward i would make a readonly property that return the internal on your question my guess you should pass blockinfo into beginblock and store it eliminate it from the parameters from the other methods then add the readonly property if you need to retrieve
