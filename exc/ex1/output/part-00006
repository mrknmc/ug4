 1992 to 1993 timeframe was pivotal and fateful for the time frame i worked on a plugin architecture for aldus which was coded in pagemaker was built on a oop framework called which assisted its portability between mac os and we tried to use the features of to build a plugin this proved to be very problematic for classes due to the brittle base class proceeded to write a paper that was published in journals and that i presented at oopsla in a reflection you can read the pdf format of the paper i presented invariant virtual member function dispatching for evolvable to the bottom and click or also made contact with bjarne stroustrup at a usenix conference in portland and proceeded to dialog with him for several where he championed the issue of dealing with the brittle base class problem on my other issues were deemed more important at that time for trying to shepard rtti through at this time introduced the system for the windows platform that was looked on as a viable solution to the could be used as an implementation language for com via abstract classes used to define com these days developers shun and especially that was based on 1994 i went on to work at microsoft and used and there for the remainder of the i came to conclude that the technology combination was a definite i refer to that experience effective enterprise distributed software contrast to all this early steve devised a plugin architecture using objective c during the early and that was integral to the next step today that lives on vibrantly in mac os x on computers and important platforms such as the submit objective c enabled solving the plugin problem in a superior champions of java will cite factors such as garbage collection as to why it is more productive than i dispute but objective c has not had garbage collection until very recently with on the iphone garbage collection is still not the os x plugin architecture has been entirely viable due entirely to the merits of objective c style of oop vs java has been used to build the most pervasive plugin architectures that exist for any platform or software development the eclipse ide plugin which by now is practically as such architectures incorporated a few years ago the equinox osgi module management j2ee app servers have supported a for ejbs for a these days all j2ee app servers of note have likewise incorporated osgi to manage runtime bindable the spring framework and its runtime bindable unit of the spring bean has grown to exceed j2ee primarily on the strength of its system for managing the binding in of the spring java community is still struggling to define an official module management standard yet even as things the java platform supports software architectures that incorporate plugin capability more pervasively than any other programming the weaknesses of java as a language relative to and that already has a stronger module implementation in its assembly java is still light years ahead in terms of everyday software systems in wide use that incorporate some form of plugin the java community even consciously realize that this is the underpinning of their continued success as an enterprise development personally regard the brittle base class problem of to be most fatal 17 years have passed since this issue was highlighted to the and to the creator of is it now too late to address 17 years is it too late to fix runtime

 2 other answers have the dpi settings may be giving you i have found that mixing with px sizing can be a real challenge once you consider dpi settings and different browser default now i just use px for font most of the problems go force that single user back to the regular i willing to bet that they are need reading glasses and the new high res monitor they got was harder to read because the print was so someone adjusted the dpi and now the fonts are the same size as the old so now they really do like the new monitor the problem now is some web pages are messed where you come thing you might want to look at when changing monitors from a crt to flat screen is the digital font smoothing fuzzy characters become this does not affect your web to address point raised by makes some excellent points in his context certainly answer was a bit lazy and the reason i use px is because of the inconsistency across to my way of specifying a point size should specify the physical size of the character to the user on the device he is but in practice it does suppose you most browsers under this defaults to the much maligned ie7 decided to use some other default and that font seems smaller and less readable in the same point the same can be said of arial verdana specify the same point and your whole layout throw in dpi settings on setup and it is setting is a bit of an your monitor or phone has a fixed you can only change it if you get a new monitor or having a dialog box to change the dpi is there only because the device does not report to the operating system what the dpi an imperfect i leave you with this suggestion use px for now to specify the font but only use it make all other sizes relative to your base when you have to port everything over to the latest blackberry or ipod that does a better job of switching from 11px to 11pt will be and test out your software so it does look nice as you boost the font

 a class has a constructor which throws a meaningful error message when construction fails when the score is outside a valid what do you think of that worries me a because calling a ctor requires memory which is relatively for each row calling a ctor and only for its expensive are great when you need but this is a case where you vould use them in a ctor but not in a check refactoring could reduce both by having the check exist as a class static or free then both the check constraint and the ctor could call score int static bool int score return score 0 int s s throw score constraint calls no construction or exception you still have the for each of a clr whether acceptable is something have to there a statement to with check all check constraints on all or do i have to them table by but you can do this to generate the table name with check check constraint from then run the resultset against the from the use base classes called constrainednumber and regexconstrainedstring for all my data i could easily move those two simple constructor code to a separate public boolean isvaluevalid method as you and probably clr overhead memory would only occur for inserts and given the simplicity of the and rate at which table updates will i think the performance impact will anything to worry about for my still really want to raise exceptions for the information provide to management studio i like the isvaluevalid because it gives me the of not throwing within applications using my data i could still get the exception by constructing an instance not sure i agree with the exception but the is that by decomposing the problem into you can select what parts wiling to pay without paying for parts you the ctor you because you were only calling it to get the so we decomposed creation and we can further decompose score int static bool int score return score 0 static int score s throw int s s score a user can call the and get the check and possible exception and call checkvalid and get the check and or isvalid to just get the paying the runtime cost for only what he

 a genetic when selecting members for crossover using selection does the population first need to be sorted by fitness possibilities seem to population first by ascending population by descending sort population let the roulette ball fall where it thinking that sorting either way may have no effect a pebble landing at random on a wheel containing different sized slices will have exactly the same outcome chance whether the larger slices are grouped together or but not do you need to do a sort every generation affects the speed of the algorithm so prefer not to would do a sort if using but not in this if you as i cannot find a definitive answer via google selection in genetic population needs to be sorted

 a i have bought into the tdd philosophy and take the effort to make extensive unit tests for any nontrivial code i sometimes this road can be painful changes causing cascading multiple unit test high amounts of scaffolding but on the whole i refuse to program without tests that i can run after every and my code is much less buggy as a been playing with and resident testing in a fashion distinctly different from quickcheck has an emphasis on testing invariants of the that certain properties that hold over all substantive of a quick a stable sorting algorithm should give the same answer if we run it should have increasing should be a permutation of the quickcheck generates a variety of random data in order to test these seems to at least for pure functions functions without side if you do mocking correctly you can convert dirty functions into pure that invariant testing could supplant unit testing as a strict superset of those each unit test consists of an input and an output imperative programming the is not just the return of the function but also any changed but this can be one could conceivably created a random input generator that is good enough to cover all of the unit test inputs that you would have manually created then because it would it would generate cases that you have thought if you find a bug in your program due to some boundary you improve your random input generator so that it generates that case is whether or not possible to formulate useful invariants for every say it a lot simpler once you have an answer to see if correct than it is to calculate the answer in the first thinking about invariants also helps clarify the specification of a complex algorithm much better than ad hoc test which encourage a kind of thinking of the you could use a previous version of your program as a model or a version of a program in another you could cover all of your former without having to explicitly code an input or an i gone or am i on to invariant testing replace unit

 a solution really but since you asked for advise against doing your own parsing you want to learn how to write a complex as you not all spaces should be there are not only cdata blocks but also elements with the which correspond to things like in xhtml the enclosed whitespaces actually have and writing a parser that is able to recognize those elements and leave the whitespace alone would be possible but would go with the parsing load the document and go printing them that way you can easily identify which nodes you can strip the spaces out of and which you there are some modules in the python standard none of which i have ever used that could be useful to try or not sure if you could do this with

 a very good rule that i came across a while an exception when a method do what its name says it idea is that an exception indicates that something has gone when you are implementing a it is not your responsibility to be aware of whether it will be used correctly or whether the code using your method catches the exception or not is not your but the responsibility of the person using your rule to follow catch an exception unless you know what you want to do with you should include cleanup code in a but you should never just catch an exception just for the sake of catching and you should never swallow exceptions while there are occasions when you may want to catch all exceptions by doing catch in these are fairly uncommon and generally have a very specific technical for when you are using threads in or if an exception escapes from your it will cause the entire application domain to in these at the very minimum you should log the exception details as an error and provide an explanation in the

 a your second take is the correct way of doing are you sure that the relation you sketched in your first take i would not be as but you know your domain better than op added a i really believe photos should ever belong to more than one event events are photo each photo is by definition from a certain and view by event is the only way to browse the pretty confident is are several lessons in that so i wanted to edit this to underline those the most important is that you model a schema without knowing two the real problem domain being what our solution requires of the initial guess was that the events and pictures were modeling the of photos at as in an art gallery a gallery of pictures on a web in that the ansel adams online gallery might very well have in which ansel adams photos are titled mature photos of or photos of all three events might include the lines in the mohave since many photos could be shown in many need a the is a and as the op any one photo is taken in one and ony one photo lesson here is that we model can only model until we know the problem also suggest that the table name be to make this ore calling it a or makes it more clear what we are the comment provides an answer to his objection that having an event fk in a photo is the op pretty astutely realizes that this avoid a and it forces the relationship to a instead of a join is an implementation the correct relationship is more as it is a modeling he should also realize is that in our and in the problem it makes sense to ask of a what photo was this photo and why not which session is a legitimate question about or attribute of a and the fk provides the answer to that it also means that in this the fk from photo to event be a photo have an a photo or else there could be no are a couple of additional lessons about what it means to have a a relationship or a and what it means to to make an fk nullable or leve those to another

 absolutely it is just compiler glue to prevent you from doing something in the caller is responsible for maintaining the stack so the cast is necessary when you invoke the function arguments and the return value are pushed onto the this makes it since the stack will not likely be mutated the invoked function can still mess up the stack in certain rare should clarify that the assignment copies the function but in all function pointers are just the type and casting is all compiler the standard specifies that the behavior is undefined if the caller uses incompatible for casting a function which returns void into one which returns an int and then calling that the value is a good idea to cast the function into a compatible type before calling or you may see unexpected

 actually ditch the nature of the class and use it as a static not an instance as you are right every property is entirely independent from each except for the string if these properties were related to each there were other variables that were set up every time that the string was assigned the properties for then be reasons to do it one way or the other with but from what doing change it to be static methods of the you insist on having the class be an then for pure performance reasons allow of the as then the clr creating and destroying instances of the same class continually for the string itself the end of the imo this is something you can really do any way you want since there are no other class instance there may be style reasons to do one or the but be hard to be when solving that if there were other variables in the class that were set upon then be a whole different but right code for what you see as the most

 advantage of anonymous inner classes is that no one can ever use it anywhere whereas a named inner class can be used only by the class that created it if made a small but it does mean that you can protect an inner class from being accidentally used using the anonymous inner class gives anyone reading your code a up class is being used just here and nowhere if you see a named inner someone might think be used in multiple places in the are very so neither point is a i just think it helps for clarity if you use anonymous inner classes for and named inner classes when used multiple times within the

 advice for your issues is general because i do not know the specifics of the platform you are working your i see two distinct web presentation layer be it will require custom spacing and even custom do not fool yourself that this will not be this is one of the biggest mistakes people make initially when internationalizing web you will need another style for the if you are using a template approach you can put most of your language content right in the the description of your it sounds like you will also need to handle localized error there is two approaches two you can have a language file where you localize when the error is thrown using a resource file another approach is to have your error messages use a common identifier and parameters and have another layer catch the message and localize i myself prefer the former solution since it is remember that if you are writing your error messages to a log that the error messages are in a language that the developers can likewise for errors displayed to users in the you will want some way for the users to identify the errors to the developers who do not speak the this could be done by using numbers i prefer using short keys like

 afraid that because a browser feature to refresh the why you set the cron job to run more frequently that every 5 there is no other option then you could create own daemon to do the job more php script 60 two more variation of version of the script will remain resident for four and execute the code 4 times which would be equivalent to running every if this script is run by cron every 5 seems some confusion about what a cronjob and how it is is a which sits in the and run tasks through the shell at a schedule specified in user has a and there is a system crontab can specify jobs which are run as that run five minutes after every 0 run at on the first of every month output mailed to 14 1 run at 10 pm on annoy 22 mail are your echo 23 minutes after 4am 4 sun echo at 5 after 4 every to run every five echo will be run every five to run every echo will be run every output from the commands are emailed to the owner of the crontab as specified by means if you run something every minute it will email you every unless you ensure all normal output is suppressed or commands are run as the user who owns the which contrasts with the scripts run by the which are run as the user similar whatever the is configured to run can make life more complicated if the cronjob is writing to files which are supposed to be accessed by the scripts run by the basically you have to ensure that the permissions remain not sure that this is the system you are refering if you mean something else by then the above might not you want to do something that your current host is not letting you then rather than hacking around the you might what to look at switching hosting alternative is to put the script in normal scripts and have some external scheduler run wget against it at whatever frequency you alternative is updating of the form of however that may not solve your

 agree with paul that this is often solved by using a soft reference though it may evict entries earlier than you a usually acceptable solution is to use a normal cache that evicts to the soft and recovers entries on a miss if this victim caching approach works pretty giving you a lower bar but extra benefit if free memory is memory size can be determined by enabling the java and usage is pretty simple when using the sizeof utility only used this for debugging and recommend benchmarking the overhead before adopting it for normal my caching i am planning on adding the ability to plug in a evaluator once the core algorithm is this way you could store a collection as the but bound the cache by the sum of all collection i have seen unbounded collections as values in caches cause so having control is quite you really need and advise not we could enhance my current implementation to support you can email

 agree with the first but would like to add to the thick and thin definition is with transports like json or rest emerging soap looks heavy on the surface for now as you might already know what makes soap heavy and ws in general is the features json is not secure in the same way that ws can i have not heard soap referred to as but many nuts look at these specifications as heavy or to be clear i am not speaking for or against either as the both have their xml more verbose and human readable and thus the last piece is that some people view http a persisting connection protocol to be heavy given newer web trends like ajax rather than serving up on big the connection overhead is large given there is really no real other than someone wants to call it is all fewer standards are perfect and for all if i had to guess some smart web developer thinks he is being oh so smart by talking about how think xml technologies are and how super json each have a	
 agree with the others that point out your second option is the accepted method for realizing a relationship many an background would lead you to feel that having an event foreign key column in the photo table is an uncomfortable coupling of two separate but from a relational database the way only way to preserve your first while preventing a photo from being used for multiple is to place a unique constraint on the photoid column of the relationship between eventphotos and photos would then become a which is kinda but you do gain a decoupling of photos and but many years of successful relational database design will still argue for the second

 all boils down to what responsibilities do you wish to assign to the client and the implementer of the defensive programming you force the implementer to check for error conditions which can be costy or even impossible in some imagine a contract specified by the binarysearch for example your input array has to be you detect this while running the you have to do a manual check for it which will actually bump the execution time an order of to back my opinion up is the signature of the method from the point is people and frameworks now tend to implement exception translation mechanisms which is used mainly to translate checked exceptions to runtime exceptions that will just pop up if something wrong this way the client and implementer of the contract has less to worry about while dealing with each this is my personal opinion backed only with what limited experience i love to hear more about this

 all of the code in classic text the c programming second edition can be compiled using a standard compilers like gcc if your c code is upto the standards followed in that classic then good enough ready to compile your c code using a the instance of linux kernel source code which is mostly written in c with some inline assembler a nightmare compiling the linux kernel code with a because of least possible reason that is being used as an variable name in linux kernel where as allow the usage of as a variable i am just giving one example remember that linux kernel is portable compiles runs very well in sparc etc this is just to illustrate that portability does have different meanings in software if you want to compile c code using a you are migrating your code base from c to i see it as two different programming languages for most obvious reason that c programmers like but i like both of them i use both of them a your c code is but you should make sure you follow standard techniques to have your code portable while you migrate your c code to read on to see from where get the standard have to be very careful porting the c code to code the next question that ask why would you bother to do that if some piece of c code is portable running well without any i accept again linux kernel a big code source in c is being managed very see the two programming languages c as different programming though does support c its basic notion is to always support for that wonderful language for backward if not looking at these two languages as different then you fall under the land of ugly programming language wars make yourself the following rules when choosing does your code or need to be compiled on different architectures possibly using native do a study of compilers on the different architectures that you wish to run your program plan for code invest good time on as far as possible try to provide a clean layer of separation between c code if your c code is you just need to write wrappers around that portable c code again using portable coding to some good books on how to write portable i personally recommend the programming language by bjarne stroustrup effective series from scott meyers popular ddj articles out there in linux kernel example in my post is just to illustrate that portability does mean different meanings in software programming criticize that linux kernel is written in c not in

 all successful software projects ever been on have been released published web with a fair amount of betas in mainly evaluate the of these open source and the previous track record for not doing stupid old beta will do as long as it does what we need but usually we stay off the immediate snapshots after major days test so we know if stuff if the libraries have bugs we stay with an older version or fix the we can also assess immediately if an update has serious bugs in because it will break our own so using software is really not a big deal any access to the latest features is always the sometimes we do it to get important

 am a developer who just jumped into ruby and rails about a year i love but i am going to say because i assume one of your main goals is to thing rails and ruby have so much metaprogramming power that the rails framework does a lot of magic for and since by definition you understand what recommend much less if you want something you either do it or use the framework components that do it for you the same kinds of capabilities that you might have used to do it so you can understand going you get projects under your you might come to resent the boilerplate or repetitive coding that any statically typed language makes you perhaps appreciate some of the magic in ruby and because understand what motivated

 am building a web site with and most of the site structure is static enough to create a folder structure and aspx the site administrators want the ability to add new pages to different sections of the site through a web interface and using a wysiwyg i am using nested master pages to give the different sections of the site their own what i would like to do is have a generic page under each section of the site that uses the appropriate master page and has a place holder for content that could be loaded from a i would also like these pages to have a url like any other aspx as if they had corresponding files on the so rather than have my url would be something problem is that does not because the administrator created it through the web and the content is stored in the what thinking is that implement an http handler that handles requests for aspx in that check to see if the url that was requested is an actual file or one of my if it is a request for a fake the request to the generic content page for the appropriate change the query string to request the appropriate data from the and rewrite the url so that it looks to the user as if the fake page really the problem having right now is that i figure out how to route the request to the default handler for aspx i tried to instantiate a but the constuctor is protected is there any way for me to tell my httphandler to call the httphandler that would normal be used to process a my handler code currently looks like public class fakepagehandler public bool get return public void reroute the request to the generic page and rewrite the pagehandlerfactory factory new this compile because the constructor is protected route the request to the default handler for aspx pagehandlerfactory factory new public string public string public string still have some work to do to determine if the request is for a real and i rewritten any urls but is something like this is there another way to create a pagehandlerfactory other than calling its is there any way i can route the request up to the httphandler for an aspx basically be saying this aspx request as you normally i use httphandler to fake the existence of aspx

 am learning c and am trying to write a program that will take 2 value from a user and will check if these strings are binary values of the characters 1 or 0 is how i approached before attempting according to user the two input 2 from input the two can implement the functions to do the math when i assume each character in the string is a binary bit in the manner of string1 but it does seem a little silly to parse through the string a character at a time to do this kind of math would be much am wondering what the most efficient way to do this sort of thing would be in i am also wondering if there would be a better way to deal with the user input than to into a string and continue to use the data as a string after checked if the contents are numeric values of 1 or did look around and did some web but i find anything that seemed obviously better to a c beginner such as any tips or suggestions would be since i am trying to learn to be efficient in my code from early way to do binary arithmetic in

 am packaging up an rpm file which has a section that detects certain conditions and runs a suite of and system i am getting some push back that it exposes some of the internal structure as i use some of the same environment variables the code itself uses for i am not planning on running the tests automatically nor exposing their existance to the end i am proposing that the testing package simply be available to any machine where the suite it adds roughtly to the final size of the package and requires an obscene amount of internal knowledge to execute program itself is a library which others may use and is exposed in an the internal knowledge of how things functions is not at my main motivation is the lack of a suitable test resources and the large variability in the target some of the tests are really simple to what configure might do to determine all the right features are available from the other tests are more involved and they prove the basic functions the library should including system test cases into the final packaged product of your application contributing to bloat or increasing

 am trying to become a good programming citizen through learning more about dependency injection ioc and other for this i have a project where i am trying to make the right choices and design everything in the whatever that might moq and mvc help with testability and getting the app the i have a question about how to design an entity base class for the objects that my application consists i have a simple class library which the web app is built on top this library exposes a irepository and the default implementation one that the app uses under the covers datacontext is not exposed to the web and simply contains ways to fetch these the repository basically looks like this interface where t t where t default implementation uses the method on the datacontext to provide the correct this requires that the base class has some it is easy enough to get my objects to inherit from it by creating a partial class of the same name as the mapped object that gives but what is the way to do the interface above has a function for getting an entity by id all the different kinds of classes that derives from entity does indeed have an field of type int from the primary key of their respective but how can i specify this in a way that lets me implement irepository like class concreterepository private somedatacontext db new public where t return public t where t return am doing this from memory on a pc so forgive any you hopefully get my trick here is of course that for this to it has to be known for sure that entity promises that everyone that derives from it has an id i can make an abstract or a normal field that is by the id field that sticks in the generated this all feels kind of like a and even gives compiler really be interface and i should try to make the id field be defined in a way that will this would also make it easy to specify other interfaces that need to should be an abstract base class with an abstract id and should it also implement needed interfaces in an abstract way for others to know well enough to see an elegant solution to so i would love to hear from more experienced system designers with some base class experience weigh in on april see i left out something important my irepository has two concrete implementations one that is the one using linq to the other one is a inmemoryrepository that just uses a list for which is used for unit testing two solutions added will both work for one of these not for the so if i would need a way to define that everything that inherits from entity will have the and that this will work with the linq to sql datacontext without base class design in for repository

 am working on a exe to export sql to we do not want to use dts as we have multiple clients each exporting different views and the overhead to setup and maintain the dts packages is too this process is automated for many clients every so the whole process has to be kicked off and controlled within a cursor in a stored this is because the data has to be filtered per project for the have tried many ways to get data out of sql into access and the most promising has been using access interop and running a have hit a problem where i am importing from and running the import manually it seems the view does not start returning data fast so access pops up a messagebox dialog to say it has timed think this is happening in interop as but because it is hidden the method never there any way for me to prevent this message from popping or increasing the timeout of the import current plan of attack is to flatten the view into a then import from that then drop the flattened for any suggestions how to tackle this info on what i am have multiple clients which each have a standard data one of the is a access exporter it reads the views to export from a parameter table then the views are filtered by and a access file is created for each project view has project are running sql 2005 and are not moving to sql 2005 we will probably jump to 2008 in quite a few then have a module execution job which executes the configured module on each there are many jobs that run in this module and the access exporter must be able to fit into this so i need a generic sql access exporter which can be configured through our parameter the sproc calls a exe i have written and my exe opens access via i know this is bad for a server but the module execution is written so only a single module is executing at a so the procedure will never be running more than one instance at a access interop data	
 am working on a form in that is used for displaying but i still need to allow some manipulation of the what i really want to do is remove the border from a this would allow me to display the information while also allowing the user to select other items in the set without having to display them be more specific i have a list of 4 or 5 email but i only want to display one at a time while allowing the user a way to easily select a different i have searched all over but find an easy way to modify the border of a and a border less combobox will fit my needs just started with so still maybe i am missing seems like this should be a lot easier than turning out to hopefully somebody can help me form is using labels to display so having a combobox in the middle of it makes it look basically what looking for is a link that when clicked opens the default email program and fills in the but i want the button so an alternate address can be i want to display a huge list of addresses if i have i just want to display one at a like a but with no could probably just add a button that displays a list of the alternate but why reinvent the wheel if i can just remove the border from a combobox and have exactly what looking the border from a

 an exception there will be time overhead which depends on how you implement your exception being the severity of an event that should cause an exception will take just as much time to handle using any other why not use the highly supported language based method of dealing with such gnu compiler uses the model by default there is no time overhead when exceptions information about code and the offsets of local objects can be computed once at compile such information can be kept in a single place associated with each but not in each you essentially remove exception overhead from each ari and thus avoid the extra time to push them onto the this approach is called the model of exception and the optimized storage mentioned earlier is known as the shadow bruce thinking in volume size complexity overhead easily quantifiable but eckel states an average of 5 and 15 this will depend on the size of your exception handling code in ratio to the size of your application if your program is small then exceptions will be a large part of the if you are using a model than exceptions will take more space to remove the time so if you care about space and not time than use is that most embedded systems have plenty of memory to the extent that if your system has a compiler you have enough space to include the computer that my project uses has several gb of secondary 512 mb of main hence no space problem for exceptions our micorcontrollers are programmed in my heuristic is there is a mainstream compiler for use otherwise use

 an programming approach rather than a procedural programming approach in a program really depend on the language it php or but on the type of problem you are trying to just going to use pseudocode in my examples as i am not too familiar with if you have a program where you are just performing a bunch of functions in then procedural is going to be for if a simple string manipulation a procedural approach would if going to deal with many different items as or any other representation then an approach would be if you had a bunch of and wanted them to then in you may do something along the line in the can drive as each car is a different their behavior can be defined they may be both subclasses or they may have common really comes down to the type of problem which makes either procedural approach better than and vice from the issue of procedural or it may be a kind of to have one source file with many this can also be said about classes which contain many functionalities which may be better performed as separate functions in separate issue here may be of code organization rather than deciding to pick procedural or organizing functions into separate source files may be needed here than to abandon the procedural approach to writing the there are plenty of programs written in the procedural programming approach which is and easy to

 answer your actual you will get an ienumerator that is bound to the state of the list as it was when you asked for further operations operate on the using a for you are making a sequence if calls to get a particular item by there an outside context such as the enumerator that knows that in a for all the collection only asking for one since the collection never handed out an no way for it to know that the reason asking for item then item then item etc is because walking the mucking with the list at the same time as walking going to get errors either if adding then the for loop may skip some while the foreach loop will if removing then the for loop may throw an index out of range if but will probably work most of the i think you understand all your question was simply why two ways of iterating behaved the answer to that is the state of the collection is the when you call getenumerator in one and when you call in the other

 anyone used the i am using it right it but it is typically quite a bit of coding for the graphical i currently am struggling to leverage the ibm uml etc built on top of good or bad experiences you made using looking back on my initial dives into etc i can say for study the there are important patterns that you have to on from the examples and not the i would also suggest a new book modeling a language specific for gmf modeling in i paged through it and it seemed to be the missing manual to some of the more basic why the book is good is that is focuses on the key to making useful through constraining it to a specific domain and providing a tool that only allows for valid models to be there is not a lot of documentation online and the api only tells you so watch out for loops caused by calling or other set methods on it crashes the eclipse not oh yes and the apis are split between eclipse help documentation versions or included at alternatives for graphical modeling you could uml profiles with custom images and icons rather than full shape it takes about 2 hours to put together a pretty good editor building on top of uml graphical objects and uml the ibm rsm tool uml profile tooling project does this there is a lot you can do with constrained uml profiles eclipse or entering gmf land is more than a order of magnitude effort from 1 to 10 hours no pure dsl specific tools out google will provide a good from what i have seen the main reason to use gmf is eclipse integration and leveraging existing this is why i use yourself do i need model which is or do i need a tool for creating instances of this if there are only expert users there may not be a need for a sleek

 app needs to keep an index of files in which the files are known by tags and suggesting a lucene document schema i s i i actual file is looked up by id in while a file has only one set of it may have multiple versions of its content identified by a only real solution it seems is one document with one document for each version such that the tags and attributes are redundant across many i i i i concern about this schema is whether it will be performant enough and compact so here are my i understand indexing scheme when the same long string is indexed as a field in many this really bulk out the index compared to if it were indexed just i create a single term make it and then add it to many does the full string data get duplicated for each document in the if this is the am i just best off putting the actual storage of the into far as i can the only info that comes back in query results is the documents themselves ordered by to determine which fields satisfied the query for a matched must i do separate queries on the fields for each or that this is just a so concurrent access is a and index updates will be quite infrequent time the user retags or a mainly concerned about response for a single user and to some extent about index size more for conserving memory rather than disk considered some alternative document but rejected my initial instinct was to avoid data duplication by splitting documents into two one type for representing a i i i then one document type for representing the of i i are a number of problems with it requires doing separate queries for content and and then matching content results to for each version document in my i must look at its fileid to then look up the corresponding file document in a separate while this is a standard relational my understanding is that a rather awkward and slow thing to do in for a query requiring both and i want to get back the file versions that include both those terms in either the or content in one and in the by splitting the from their this becomes very tricky likely maybe i can just keep content and together by keeping multiple content i i i i question is whether i can identify a content field so i can know which version content produced the i could name each content field corresponding to the version i i i i if i could identify the content that caused the document to match the consolidating the versions messes up the and attributes in lucene shared across

 appdomain is an isolation unit within a appdomains can be created at loaded with and its an isolation boundary designed to make apps more assembly holds one or more which hold compiled chunks of you will typically see an assembly as an or a process is an executing application thread is an execution the operating system executes code within a the operating system switches between allowing each to execute in thus giving the impression that multiple applications are running at the same put it all together program is a process is created by the operating and within its single thread it starts loading code to in a a single appdomain is created by the the executing assembly is loaded into this appdomain and begins the application can spawn new create load other assemblies into these and then create new threads to execute code in any of these	
 appears that the poster is seeking a evolution which produces something similar to the observed agree that it would be extremely unlikely to produce a replica of the observed earth even something superficially by applying an evolutionary model with stochastic i believe impossible to produce something similar by employing an evolutionary model with event in since it actually there should be some set of events that could be added to the simulation that corresponded to the initial random event which produces the exact i think this sort of thing is still well beyond us computationally i think it will be for this would be an interesting way to attempt to find approximate answers to questions regarding gaps in historical it would essentially be a computational way to produce concrete testable it might not even be too different from the way we do it inside our

 append content to a you should only call during the parsing you have a call to somewhere where it executes outside that such as in your event there is no parsing going so nowhere for that string to should happen according to the javascript handlers execute after the original document so the write method implicitly opens a new document of mimetype if you do not explicitly issue a method in the event it assumes made a mistake and meant to replaces the entire document with new also notice that because you finish that off by the throbber is still expecting more content to be written to the document it never this you are a how are you is clearly not a valid html chrome which behaves the is trying to parse it as an html but fails because it is text content outside the document element which is not if you put some tags in the name how are you see everything outside the element is firefox and ie manage to apply their up text outside any to save but chrome you want to a new you should make sure it is indeed a complete how are you if you want to a text you should theoretically the but the mimetype parameter is not supported by chrome or always treat what you write as any probably want to be using this if you want to add to the existing page you should normally be using dom such as setting the text on a status output or replacing the body contents using is needed in a few places when you are creating a new window or frame from but otherwise generally the wrong thing and should be viewed with

 application is using wcf for which has been however one shortcoming of the current architecture is that i must use known type configuration for certain transmitted using an mechanism and this requirement is problem is that easy to forget to add the known and if you wcf fails silently with few clues as to going my i know the set of types that are going to be i would like to perform the configuration rather than declaratively through the file which currently contains something like like to do something like type in how would i write this someone please explain how i might do please understand that trying to set the known types dynamically at run time rather than declaratively in config or using attributes in the source is basically a question about the wcf not a style msdn page can also add types to the accessed through the knowntypes property of the all it says and it make terribly much sense given that knowntypes is a readonly and the value is a do you configure wcf known types	
 application projects are like any other visual studio they have a project file or which is an msbuild description of how to build the this is how web applications were built on since day visual studio microsoft decided that this was too they got rid of web application projects and replaced them with web site these are not actually but are rather a collection of files in a folder on on an ftp on were loudly informed of their and quickly came out with visual studio 2005 which put web application projects back in the where they are to this and always will code in a web application project all gets compiled into a single the code in a web site is only compiled when it is this can be a benefit during development working on one and actually find it sort of cool to be able to change some save then press f5 in the browser to see the the other what working on now actually a web site not a product that needs to be packaged up and shipped to i may be but i like the idea that my code compile before i ship it to i was taught hard to test what i

 applying the same plugin to several elements like should split it in 5 different calls with different options opts1 opts2 add a paraemter to to receive which options object it should work if not calling from inside you should consider why sharing options between in that if you post your original problem real world problem trying to we might be able to offer a better solution than having two different plugins sharing options instead of merging them into just	
 approach dynamic is basically each substring of the original figure out all possible values it can in your first example can become either or may be a lot of different but many of them will be you should ignore all combinations that are greater than the when you add a or a you can envision it as combining two substrings of the since you have the possible values for each you can see if such a combination is values can be generated try splitting the substring in all possible and combine the different values in each half of the total number of is something like target for your example than the but if you had a string of length 1000 and a target of say then the problem would be solvable with dynamic	
 approach only really works well if you are working on your if you have to work within a team of it is important to have a good plan so that everyone else knows what you think is the end this reduce creativity it just allows you to make sure everyone is on the same and it reduces the opportunities for on	
 approach would be to get the most recent item from each followed by the most recent items from all and limit you could construct pathological examples where this probably what you but it should be pretty good in	
 approach would be to wrap the code object in another something like def return whenever you need the code object you use and whenever you need the you use there may be a way to get eval to treat the new class as though it were an ordinary code redirecting the function to call advantage of this is the original string is deleted at the same time as the code however you do i think storing the original string is probably the best as you end up with the exact string you not just an	
 approach you could take would be to create a class per then let that class perform the it will know if multiple tasks could be used at and restrict access to each of hence class private bool public void i have left out locking code if you are accessing this from multiple which i think you in if you wanted to execute this you could use asynchronous delegates and manual reset events to achieve what your are	
 approaches always though not as elegant as just use after a you just get to know which hex digits represent which bit use constants and or or add for example need qualifiers on the bit patterns to make them unsigned or b0 b1 b31 long x b2 if performance critical and readability is you can just do it at runtime with a function such as as a sneaky you could write a that goes through your files and creates the ones by replacing all strings with their equivalent i do this lightly since all sorts of tricky combinations of syntax you may have to worry but it would allow you to write your string as you want to without having to worry about the vagaries of the and you could limit the syntax trickiness by careful the next step after that would be patching gcc to recognize constants but that may be an overkill

 architectural point of view i would say you are about to break the it might be a bad decision providing resource dictionary with notion of ui that consumes it and giving some logic other than providing might want some adapter between ui and resource or controller if this is really needed to wire resource dictionary but again you inject any logic in a resource	
 architecture usually has each layer separated by the the presentation layer is on some web then that talks to backend app servers over the network for business then that talks to a database again over the and maybe the app server also calls out to some remote services for payment is a programming design pattern where different portions of code are responsible for representing the and controller in some these two things are related for instance the model layer may have an internal implementation that calls a database for storing and retrieving the controller may reside on the and remotely call appservers to retrieve mvc abstracts away the details of how the architecture of an app is just refers to the physical structure of an these two are sometimes confused because an mvc design is often implemented using an

 are a couple of this going wrong is not defined in so comparing with it yield undefined i then unclear what sumofa will return inside the surely not what you code is not actually storing anything in the array compile your code with all on and make sure there are warnings when your code that the variable is use now that you added the code of is no use for so you can remove it in your question you mention storing the numbers in an array and then summing do you to do or to do that to some because not simply add the result of all calls to the array is then i see you fixed the code in some your code currently adds the first argument to each of the arguments separately and prints not quite there good	
 are a few fringe out there that separate the programming view from the but these are mostly research and deal mostly with the not the look up for some of the stuff out the general idea is to model the code as an ast in the background and provide a interface to that that ast can then be stored as such as plain or even a binary be much of a leap at all to go from this sort of model to one that actually prettified the comments and gave you a wysiwyg	
 are a few reasons that i sometimes counsel people not to use certain cpan not all of cpan is and there are varying levels of maintenance for different everyone should consider how much work they have to do to use a particular cpan module and what that module saves them total cost of using any particular cpan module is not always a i say that people should not use any of but they should consider what they really need from external module dependency allows someone else to break your the cpan toolchain only ever cares about the latest version of a module and may upgrade your installation when it sees you have an earlier seen many applications break when the underlying external dependencies introduce new deprecated needed and so one of the reasons been developing my tools for companies to host their own cpan repositories so they can control there are other ways to mitigate but not many people are sophisticated enough to have a good process for work in an environment where all code has to be this seems like a silly requirement to a lot of but the risk management people have a job to do sometimes that compliance is mandated by various standards of and so unless the module is really going to save a lot of time and the benefit may not be worth the effort to go through that how many of you ever seriously inspect the code you get from there could be anything in cpan modules implement using a module just because on cpan and you want to write the three lines of code yourself is a bit you can talk about code reuse all you but eventually ad of some modules can be quite and and sometimes this is due to the long list of dependencies to just build and test the module even though you need those dependencies to actually use the it takes a lot of work to handle these cases in automated testing cpan authors are experimental not creating dependencies on their work means you end up with an unsupported module that get patched and no one else really cares getting your patches accepted is a really big deal for some important and you fix the unresponsive author without resorting to some process for using a locally patched version and overwritten by the cpan escape these reasons with glib answers about using another installing in a local and so you apply your counter arguments to every situation and anyone telling you such as the top post in seven reasons not to use that leon links really thinking about and there are many thoughtful ever start from the position of thinking anyone should or use evaluate the local evaluate the risks and develop safeguards for the and use modules not any different from any other sort of serious software development or business d

 are at least two important of is based on the unicode standard for and sorts accurately in a very wide range of comes very close to correct unicode sorting in many common but has a number of inaccuracies in some languages making in unsuitable for correct sorting in those is faster at comparisons and because it takes a bunch of uses a much more complex comparison algorithm which aims for correct sorting according in a very wide range of this makes it slower to sort and compare large numbers of defines complex sets of rules for how characters should be these rules need to take into account not everybody sorts their characters in what we would call far as latin languages there is not much difference between the unicode sorting and the simplified sorting in but there are still a few the unicode collation sorts like and like as people using those characters would normally whereas sorts them as single characters like and such as asian languages or languages with different there may be a lot differences between unicode sorting and the simplified the suitability of will depend heavily on the language for some be quite unicode characters are defined as which means they count toward the sort order and the comparison should move on to the next character handles these should you is almost never any reason to use as we have left behind the point where cpu speed is low enough that the performance difference would be your database will almost certainly be limited by quite other bottlenecks than this the difference in performance is only going to be measurable in extremely specialised and if already know about if experiencing slow in almost all cases be an issue with your changing your collation function should not be high on the list of things to i originally wrote this answer 4 years i said that if you you could use most of the and only use when sorting was going to be important enough to justify the performance the performance cost is no longer really relevant it may not have been back more important to sort properly in whichever language your users are other thing add is that even if you know your application only supports the english it may still need to deal with which can often contain characters used in other languages in which it is just as important to sort using the unicode rules for everything helps add peace of mind that the very smart unicode people have worked very hard to make sorting work

 are many more congestion control algorithms than you mention off the top of my head the list are also small variations of them due to bug fixes in actual implementations and guess that implementations in different oses also behave slightly different from one if i need to try to come up with an idea it would be to estimate the rtt of the you can try to look at the time it took between the third and the fourth as the first and second packets may be tainted by arps and other discovery algorithms along the you have an estimate for rtt you could try to refine it along the not exactly sure how you could do that but you require a full spec for the just ideas the rtt figured out you can try to put the packets into rtt bins and count the number of in flight data packets in each this way be able to of packets in to time and try some pattern matching alternative would be to go along the trace and try to in your head the different congestion control algorithms and see if the decision at any point matches with the decision you would have it will require some leniency and accuracy definitely sounds like an interesting and challenging

 are really 2 types of static that are static because they can that are static because they have to a small to medium size code base you can really treat the two methods you have a method that is in the first category and you need to change it to access class relatively straight forward to figure out if possible to turn the static method into a instance a large code the sheer number of call sites might make searching to see if possible to convert a static method to a non static one too many times people will see the number of and say i better not change this but instead create a new one that does what i can result in lot of code explosion in the number of method of those things are my advice would be that if you have a code base over 200k that i would only make methods static if they are refactoring from to static is relatively easy add a so if you want to make a into an actual static later you need functionality outside of an then you the inverse turning a into a instance method is much more large code bases better to error on the side of ease of rather than on the side of idealogical for big projects make things static unless you need them to for small just do what ever you like

 are useful when you want to mock an interaction between an object and one of its however there is less value in an interface for an object which has internal say i have a service which talks to a repository in order to extract some domain object in order to manipulate it in some is definite design value in extracting an interface from the my concrete implementation of the repository may well be strongly linked to nhibernate or by linking my service to the interface i get a clean separation from this implementation it just so happens that i can also write super fast standalone unit tests for my service now that i can hand it a mock the domain object which came back from the repository and which my service acts there is less when i write test for my i will want to use a real domain object and check its after the call to i want to check that something was added to the domain i can test this by simple inspection of the state of the domain when i test my domain object in i need interfaces as i am only going to perform operations on the object and quiz it on its internal is it valid for my sheep to eat grass if it is the first we are interested in based interfaces help because we want to intercept the calls passing between the object under test and its collaborators with in the second case we are interested in based interfaces help try to be conscious of whether you are testing state or interactions and let that influence your interface or no interface that you have a copy of resharper it is extremely cheap to extract an interface it is also cheap to delete the interface and revert to a simpler class hierarchy if you decide that you need that interface after my advice would be to start without interfaces and extract them on demand when you find that you want to mock the you bring ioc into the then i would tend to extract more interfaces but try to keep a lid on how many classes you shove into your ioc in you want to keep these restricted to largely stateless service

 asking for possible changes to the so i presume a significant engineering team behind this are also a few pieces of clarififying info that would help define the problem much ipc process do you they really have to be or can they be is it okay if the have to talk to each other through and not by using shared is the memory are you straight smp with 1024 or is there some other numa memory or mmp going on what are your page tables only the very smallest of info about azul i would guess that you have very little and that a simple one kernel per model might actually work out just if processes need to talk to each then they can create sockets and transfer data that does your hardware support this would likely end up needing one ip address per core as and at 1024 ip this might be although they could all be and maybe not such a big if this model would lead to some like extra page and a fair bit of ram and may even not be supported by your hardware if kernel per you could likely run and be just letting each kernel control 8 physical if you wanted to run 1 thread per core in a traditional smp machine with 1024 cores only a few physical then i would expect that the old fashioned scheduler is what likely that your will end up nearly in kernel and doing interrupt but just fine for this use unless you need more than 1 core to handle your

 assuming you are teaching c to students who already know how to program in another language like java back in my i think c is a good language to use for teaching programming to complete would teach pointers this is one of the important new ideas that that will be learning in they will already know the concept of arrays from other so no urgency to teach this so when you do cover arrays in you can talk about how they are essentially syntactic sugar for pointer a concept they are now familiar	
 assuming you mean char for the first line of code you get a rather strange the basic principal is that ascii codes for digits are the code for the code for and so subtracting simply converts from the ascii code to the actual so and so note that this will only work if the character subtracting from is an actual digit otherwise the result will have little without context the of this code is impossible to as for what it appears that the if statement evaluates as true when bit i of is not that particular bit is a i believe the operator gets executed before the as the operator has very low the code could make better use of parentheses to make the intended order of operations in this the order of operations might not matter though i believe the result is the same either this is simply creating a number with all bits except bit i set to a convenient way of creating a mask for bit i is to use the expression bitwise or operation in this case is used to set the bits specified by the row constant to if these bits are not it sets if already set it has no	
 assuming you want to still see stderr and stdout on the you could go for josh but i find keeping a around in the background which outputs your log file very hackish and notice how you need to keep an exra fd and do cleanup afterward by killing it and technically should be doing that in a is a better way to do and already discovered instead of just using it for your have a tee for stdout and one for how will you accomplish process substitution and file split it up and creates a fifo and lets listen on it uses to redirect the stdout of to the fifo that your first is listening thing for the use process substitution again to make a process that reads from stdin and dumps it into outputs its input back on but since its input is our we want to redirect stdout to our stderr then we use file redirection to redirect stderr to the input substitution is one of those really lovely things you get as a bonus of choosing as your shell as opposed to or have to do things

 at least one virtual method in a class any of its parent means that the class will have a virtual and every instance will have a virtual the memory cost is quite the most important is the memory cost on the instances if the instances are for example if they are just meant to contain an in this case having a virtual pointer in every instance might double the size of the as for the memory space used up by the virtual i guess it is usually negligible compared to the space used up by the actual method brings me to my is there a measurable performance cost speed for making a method there will be a lookup in the virtual table at upon every method so if there are very frequent calls to this and if this method is very then there might be a measurable performance i guess it depends on the but has anyone run some reason i am asking is that i came across a bug that happened to be due to a programmer forgetting to define a method this is not the first time i see this kind of and i why do we the virtual keyword when needed instead of the virtual keyword when we are absolutely sure that it is if the performance cost is i think i will simply recommend the following in my simply make method virtual by including the in every and only remove it when you need does that sound crazy to for you kind is the performance cost of having a virtual method in a

 been running up against a problem with java swing my wacom graphire tablet for a few years in several java applications and have now encountered it in my use a pen tablet to get around wrist issues while clicking a and it works fine under windows except when using java in java the of the pen work the problem only occurs with dialog boxes or tree the pen tablet also comes with a wireless mouse that works with the same and its does work know whether the problem is in the wacom driver or in the java swing runtime for windows or has anyone encountered this like to file a bug report with wacom but i have no idea what to tell have been able to reproduce this in my own application that has a jeditorpane with an html document that added a hyperlinklistener i get events on every single click with the but i do not get events on every single click with the big difference between a pen and a mouse is that when you click a button on a really easy to cause the without mouse on the pen tablet it is very hard to do and that seems to correlate with the lack of events if i am very careful not to move the pen position when i tap the i think i can get activated suggestions for things to try so i can give wacom some good information on this really frustrating to not be able to use my pen with java especially since the pen works fine with windows i ask this question here but like to find out from a standpoint what might be going on so i can file a good bug swing debugging headaches with wacom pen

 been working in tool support for traceability in software engineering on and off for the last fifteen and the best widely available is they all require manual connection to be made you can add ids to your code and unit and get some coverage metrics quite easy to make a simple tool which associates a specific test with a requirement and then reports that requirement as similarly you can add markers to say what parts of your code map to your design elements that has mostly been automated by reverse engineering then you can tell whether you have markers for all your requirements and all your design these are extensions to cots uml so probably not designed in quite the same spirit as no tool aware of currently gives you is any means to actually determining whether the tests exercise the parts of the design which are supposed to implement the hyperlinked requirement is as you can log the coverage in the code which is linked to the design elements when the test is are other such as cadiz and cog which are theorem proving tools which can take a formal description of your requirements and annotated model of your code and verify that the model matches the this works for sufficiently simple but is fairly time consuming the order of weeks for a few dozen lines of for level computer of the tools i know of integrate with

 best way to get rid of warnings is to address the suspicious code that the warnings complain that change the code such that it is no longer just seek to disable the generation of warnings need to provide more details about the specific warnings concerned and the accompanying but remember to search previous answers here see the warnings are actually text literally in your not messages issued in the compiler the way to get rid of those is to search for the keyword i consider whether the issue that it warns about has been addressed or is still a valid fix the problem if there is and the delete that warning for does a default and if does it need should you use to a property not really asking how to delete a line of are already gone through the whole file and determined that none of the warnings are a quick way of removing all the warning you already have on your then you have a complete development environment get a the option tells it to invert the search thus printing all lines that contain the search those get written into the new then replace the old file with the new

 big thing to keep in mind is that forms authentication works based on when the client browser sends a request to the it sends the cookie with each if the server requires a specific cookie makes this a requirement if enforcing authentication on a particular and the cookie this is when you get the unauthorized order to get your jquery the client has to request it from a host which could be an page that is protected via forms this is the first step securing access to the jquery code the next thing you need to do is secure access to the restful you put the endpoint hosting the restful wcf service in in the same directory as part of your application that is being protected by forms authentication via then will reject requests to the endpoint before wcf is told about the in this you can wrap your wcf service in forms authentication without having to do any complicated coding within the when making http requests of your is doing so from within the context of your http requests made from jquery long as the jquery was loaded from the same root as your forms authenticated will contain the authentication

 blocks should only be around pieces of code that are capable of throwing exceptions involving anything involving an external those cases it is best to have only the relevant local variables something that will be these exceptions are expected and so you need to log them in a way that differentiates between expected and code you are not adding extra context to the then you are misusing your logging it is always better to catch and rethrow rather than not catch at all executes the finally but you should also add a relevant note to every logging otherwise you will actually be damaging your ability to debug the because you have no idea where the exception was thrown files are no harm in having a lot of information in them whenever you throw an the more error logging you the easier it will be to debug a production

 boost is discussed as for language features that are all of is a dangerous language to use if you know enough of objects and templates probably cover the most important boost is designed similarly to the so knowing your standard library is boost itself uses a lot of template but as a library you often need that you start playing with related to memory management are a good indicator that rather than boost you need to brush up the techniques for handling memory safely are well and not specific to the obvious exception of smart is probably the most important concept to understand to deal with this kind of

 bottom line issue is that world wide web desktop application no matter how much want it to numerous issues these are some which pop into is desktop applications www is made stateful usually by uri parameters and session management and now that those for a couple of mostly gone over the issue of pages are described with some form of xml and usually in which the page is described as a comparing to desktop while possibly to do nearly the same with xml and just plain component it just the once again one of the biggest issues is that in da those are stateful by nature on the level while in www you can be truly stateful on the level at most and even that requires direct use of layout managers is a assuming the web ui framework using allows you may create something that behaves quite similarly to layout while i know about gwt i believe that one could do at least a simple layout manager in jsp my and make it behave just as the swing layout managers that i really do mean the whole concept of layout managers here as a set of specialized just as peter gwt support them directly fact i heard anything beyond swing and i believe it would be more of an effort to create a for swing layout managers instead of just creating your properietary ones for

 broadly agree with the principle that commented out code be checked the source control system is a shared and your colleague to an using it as his personal scratch this very considerate to the other especially if you subscribe to the idea of shared ownership of the next developer to see that code would have no idea that a work in is he free to change is it dead he your change in a state where it can be checked he needs to finish learn to make incremental in partial changes that may or may not be presumably that also means may or may not be a slippery slope to a very ropey code	
 broadly that when you x in loop body goes the python is doing something like i x loop body goes i you insert for the loop perhaps then be able to see why you get the result you python uses a moving pointer to traverse the the pointer starts by pointing at the first then you remove the first thus making the element the new first then the pointer move to the new second previously third and so might be clearer if you use instead of as your sample

 but still believe there is something to add to the superb advice given so to answer your question we need to go a level hence the long been made a tech lead responsible for team and although many aspects of your everyday job might seem to resemble your dev days the way you need to go about them has in software development environment there is usually not that much of a tangible change when you appointed a tech lead probably still seating at the same wearing the same as opposed to becoming a foreman on construction site or a the flattering change though is that you now get invited into all these meeting and start getting all these and phone calls from people outside the dev lack of tangible change might trick your mind into thinking that you just need to keep treating your job mostly the this is not the case and you need to be conscious about your actions and in the new it might seem now a bit externally and you might be inclined to share some of that coming your way play a bit of democracy and generally be this is not that much about fairness or the new job is the dev team by personal example and creating imagery depicting the an abstraction layer between the team and other organisational much like in programming you often create an abstraction layer to encapsulate and hide the same happens in the the interface that has to encapsulate the dev and any good encapsulation from an outsider point of inner complexity that is not relevant to the task at hand as concrete implementation of an from the outside things that could affect the outside user explicit that can be any limitations and constraints gives meaningful principles are equally applicable to the outward not an easy task to follow these actually it involves a lot of concrete such as deciding what details are internal and what facts need to be communicated and how the feedback needs to be best structured and be presented in a consistent manner and who should be notified externally of and who needs to followed up and this is a lot of even if some of it seems to be just trivial to inward one way is to but it clogs the internal network and everyone has to spend their time on deciding whether the communication bears any relevance to it is like having a very generic algorithm that regardless of input always does the exact same amount of sure but why would you want to do a more efficient way is obviously to adjust processing depending on the input and here it has to be job to make a decision how the team should go about to or convert the what sequence of actions needs to be just acknowledge and store for future follow put an issue off for a later review and then make sure it is reviewed and fed back into the is not a small job either and someone has to do obviously now your job to manage the outward and inward and you have to spend some of your processing power to do it so no one else has to and devs can concentrate on their are some other good reasons for not or everyone regardless of your job means cc note for future bcc or mass you should be careful when you use one or another a group of a single person is a straight forward when a group of people only these who you need to take action a simple this is default in any other case explicitly tell them what is expected no action needed only these who you want to take note of the information for the future if you expect a number of to go back and forth before an agreement is reached or issue is resolved best to send a summary confirmation later to other parties that need to be besides saving time and avoiding misinterpretation due to someone taking note of a communication that will help make exchange more flow more and reduce formalism and often treated formally and this always a good thing sometimes exactly what you bcc is almost never the knowledge of someone eavesdropping on your conversations if come to light will easily ruin your it is simply a question of and should your team worry then that you might be their conversations to someone mass mailing through bcc in most cases is also it creates an impression that is specifically addressed to the and require little but multiply noise and dilutes it is worth to give some thought to what exactly you need a person to do and what they should know to act on your communication before composing conversations are best taken completely or better still because it gives you more room for broadcasting or formalising in writting is just like putting yourself into a you can always confirm in writing to the second part of a tech lead responsibility the team through personal example and imagery depicting the to accomplish that you need to pass on to the team every single piece of information that happen to end in your you have to create a story and any good story is an abstraction of real events that consists of only relevant and interesting detail for a particular creating this brief story on the basis of your everyday experience and judging what is relevant and interesting and then presenting it regularly to the team is also quite a forget that by directing the team and serving as abstraction layer you help developers and outside world to interact more accomplish more and tackle greater the job has a

 by point you mean the folder per i can see your i would simply add the reference to each test on the other you really mean put your tests in the same assembly as your i heartily agree with him and disagree with your tests should be distinct from your production code in order to enhance code clarity and keeping your test classes separate helps the next programmer understand it more if you need access to internals in your tests and you might since internal methods are to the you can use the internalsvisibleto construct in the would recommend in it is sufficient to unit test only the public interface of the done properly the private methods of your code will simply be refactorings of previous public code and will have sufficient test coverage through the public of this is a guideline not a law so there will be times that you might want to test a private in those you can create an accessor and use reflection to invoke the private recommendation that i would make is to use unit testing and code coverage in code coverage can be a useful heuristic to identify when you need more lack of coverage should be used as a guide to indicate where more testing may be this to say that you need coverage some code may be simple enough not to warrant a unit test for and they may not be touched by your existing were a couple of issues that i had with the probably the biggest is the lack of abstraction away from the database for unit there probably are some integration tests that need to go against the db perhaps when testing trigger or constraint functionality if you convince yourself of their correctness in of the opinion that you should implement your data access as then mock out the actual implementations in your unit tests so that there is no need to actually connect to the i find that my tests run and thus i run them more often when i do building up a database interface might take a little while but can be reused as long as you stick with the same design pattern for your data i would recommend using nunit with a very useful plugin whether doing nunit or makes it very handy to run or debug tests with a context

 can be called from if the type you call it on have a good implementation the default is to return the type name rather than something meaningful about the instance of that this method is inherited from the base and you can overload it in your own types to do whatever you is a not a function you should only use this if the object you need already is a string in some or if you know there is a good implicit conversion available from this will throw an exception is the object cannot be converted when the object is is another way to write but it differs in that it returns rather than throwing an exception if the cast attempts to actually the argument into a this is the best option if you really know much about the it can be slow because it has to do a lot of extra work to determine what kind of results to but that same work also makes it the most robust option when you know very much about the if nothing else is it will fall back to calling the the string method can also be used to convert certain types to with the additional advantage that you have some control over what the resulting string will look this is a little more but includes a couple different mechanisms for converting objects into a representation that can be safely stored and from disk or other streaming that includes a binary but most often involves converting to a string in some format or other serialization is appropriate when you want to later convert the your string back into originating or if you want a complete representation of a complex

 categories of uses for perfectly reasonable and downright helpful uses of for variable string of bytes you have in your generated embedded documentation see old source control history to the in practice you may have to include some ugly artifact in your code depending on some tool or some strange requirement which is helpful or needed for some but its not something you want to scroll over all the so you compromise by keeping it in your code but stashing it away so its not in your illegal uses of punishable by wtfs such and paste big chunks of heard of a malicious or code that lazy reviewers ask there are uses that depend on your such it to group members with related it to group types of class members is a but i believe that it is much more useful to group members by relationship or functionality rather than simply their grouping constructors may make sense because they all perform a similar function and may very well call each therefore it may be helpful to group them in a you could have several private methods that do all kinds of different some serving one set of some serving the just the fact that they are private methods does not imply that they are strongly related or that they should be maybe they could instead be grouped by what kinds of application specific functions they maybe some are dedicated to order submission and others are dedicated to data we naturally like to group things by but we have to remember that it is sometimes more helpful to group things by some functional relation as i this last group is largely up to and heavily depends on the type of application and also your forget there are other ways to organize your code such as partial classes or further refactoring of a class into multiple go use	
 cerberus is not supported in javascript you need to get rid of that and use something to keep in mind is that there is no standard for regular expression it is different in each so testing in something that uses the regular expression engine is not a valid test of how it will work in try and look for a reference on javascript regular such as match that looks for characters is also this will ensure that there are at least 8 but it does not limit the string to since the character class with the at the end can match as many characters as what you want instead is to replace the at the end with the and eliminate it from the re the other not really sure why you would want to restrict the length of unless a hard database limit there since you be storing passwords in plain text in the but instead hashing them down to something fixed size using a secure hash algorithm with a and as i see a reason to be so restrictive on the set of characters you recommend something more like re why would you forbid l and o from your passwords it looks like trying to forbid i as which you forgot to this will make it very hard for people to construct good and since you never see a password as you type no reason to worry about letters which look confusingly if you want to have a more permissive re

 constructs like and exist so that can be used as a kind of lexical these are sort of like but instead of collecting a span of as many characters as they collect just a span of characters as described by the character there might be cases where writing might make but not sure i see a compelling use case for complementary classes with is simply not the right tool for this every time set out to use one of its more powerful ended up eventually ripping it out and implementing the capability in a different in some cases that meant using lex to write a real lexical but usually doing line at a time and breaking it coarsely into tokens with before doing value conversion was i ended ripping out typically because when faced with users insisting on providing incorrect it just good at helping the program give good feedback about the and having an assembler print as its sole helpful error message was not going over well with my in that

 converting some of my classes to use datacontractserialization so that i can include linq entities in the a sort of theoretical question popped into my head while i was in the and while betting the answer is i figured pose the question there a way to conditionally serialize an for instance if serializing an employee object with the intention to send information to a customer i might not want to include the on the other hand if serializing it to use in a web service for the site that manages that employee i might need that possibility would be serializing certain members based on whether they were the base object being serialized or so if i have a ticket class which contains a and the location contains a list of contacts i probably want that contacts list if i were serializing the but if i were trying to work with the location it might be good to any thoughts on you get conditional control over serialization with

 cost depends on which class is implementing and the specific usage the will very depending on the implementation you are in typically a fairly low overhead many it can be as simple as a check to see if the current thread is the same as the original being if you need worth the even if only of the time that it will be it should be you are asking for a or some other very undesirable most cases where you could be using this are cases where you should always include this most common use case is synchronizing delegates onto the ui in this you must use or very bad things in this the cost is very low compared to the waiting on the message pump for ui so really not worth worrying you are using it with a custom implementation of and happening in a tight and profiled and found that causing problems for then it may be worth worrying in this i would recommend trying to rework the algorithm itself to avoid the need for synchronizing as much as but still use invokerequired as

 could limit the features of your developers can use by writing the restrictions into your coding then when code is reviewed prior to check any code that breaches these rules should be spotted and the check in one such case could well be extension your developers will want to use the new features all developers if got well documented reasons why they be good developers will follow you should also be open to revising these rules as new information comes to vs 2008 you can specify which version of you want to target click over the solution and select properties if you limit yourself to then you get any of the new features in obviously this help if you want to use some of the i think your fears over are is still as strongly typed as declaring something as simply tells the compiler to pick the best type for this the variable change type always an or or personally i follow the same rules as paul if the type is clear from the syntax then use a if not name the type

 definitely a good idea to keep fairly close to the current by not upgrading you save on any immediate but you save an enormous amount of work for later on in the life typically those who make the conservative decision will be long gone by the time the absolute critical need to upgrade occurs so they away there it is up to us as technical resouce to point out that short term pain is better than a complete project meltdown shining example of this is a massive system written on oracle which is still on oracle today it fails next to impossible to patch as that version is too and will be thrown away as soon as anyone has the political cajones to make it the cost of not upgrading would currently be running at in specialist and lack of compatibilty with other line is not upgrading means big dollars being spent

 develop a certain till two versions could not be installed at the same now changing and the question came should the version number be appended to the server components or the server contains 3 exes and 5 dlls some native should any or all have their name contain the version or the pros it should make managing the server a bit if a certain instance misbehaves it would be identifiable in the task no chance a bad installation will end with having mixed components versions without it being the cons it would make development a bit the server is not a standalone but rather a part of our applications this means it gets the main that a certain component will have to get a different name even if it changed at all between in this is not a crucial we can probably get along with both having that i might have missed a winner argument in favor of one of the what is the common what do you familiar with com and file metadata and agree filename versioning is trying to figure out more significant the constant redundancy or the rare gain in executables contain version numbers in their

 directory can fulfill two related but seperate functions for an authorization and is validating that the person using your application is a valid if you have the credentials the application prompts the user for their username and you can authenticate them against ad by attempting a connection using their is what lets you determine the level of permissions a particular user has in your active directory groups are a relatively straightforward and flexible way to implement the various permissions i will create very permissions groups that represent each securable action users can perform in the application caneditwidgets then create functional or role groups where you place the users for that role you just nest the role groups into the permissions groups so for the business requirement is that managers can delete you would add the managers group as a member of the candeletewidgets while this may seem more it makes it extremely simple to respond to changing business security requirements need to be able to delete piece of add the technicians role group to the candeletewidgets permissions group and far as logging in there are a number of ways you can automatically log in a for winforms you should just be able to grab the currently logged in user and use for web if you can use integrated you end up with the same your web server will handle the authentication piece and send over the of the user in a server header

 do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of amazon web services s3 compared with google application the cost per gigabyte for the two at the time i roughly i have not seen any widespread complaints about the quality of so i think the decision of which one to use may depend on the api all api breaks your content into what they call such as your css etc and http requests for static stuff will be served to whoever requests it until your bandwidth limit is requests will be fulfilled until your bandwidth or cpu limit is with respect to your you can provide any logic you are able to express in so you can be choosy about who you api treats all your content as blobs in a and provides an access protocol that lets you distinguish between a variety of fulfillable requests ranging from to if you want to something not in the i know what you do beyond being thoughtful about distributing your differences do you see between the are there other cloud storage services you had a press release but looking for a minimum of ten terabytes on the beta and none of my clients are there and will probably do something in the near advantages of storage using amazon web services s3 vs google application	
 do you try to the part going wrong the source code is irrelevant at this may indeed be necessary to put the applet and the html page that contains it in a webserver in order for it to be able to connect to the database due to the security restriction that applets are only allowed to connect to the server loaded note that except for a learning an applet should never connect directly to a database because inherently whoever runs the applet can decompile it and get the db user and password and in your case why decompile when you could just guess it at that the users and passwords inside your db become they can do anything the db user read all data and log in as an arbitrary user at the very and probably add and delete data at will as do you mean with shows the no your and the html file in is and the file is not from the html it may be that all you have to do is to remove the codebase attribute of the applet tag it would only be corret if the java file were in a subdirectory named when you talk about what you in the that sounds the jdbc url has nothing to do with the html location in for where you put the method that connects to the database does not the classes are all part of the applet as far as the browser is

 dynamic linq library is a fine as generate expressions you can compile to code in a lightweight example you provided actually produces a boolean so you should be able to ask for a func and it might sort it this of course is as expressions have assignment in them at another potential way is to take two one to find the property you one to provide a use reflection to set the property referenced in the first lambda with the result of the second but still probably lightweight compared to invoking the way you have to do much codegen yourself the expressions you get will contain most everything you

 easy to make a big deal out of to my mind it is a pretty and useful it quantifies on you will learn from an like flipping a taking a branch or indexing an a comparison operation in the middle of a search algorithm has a certain probability p of taking one and of taking the p is as it is in a binary then if you take that you know 1 bit more than you did because base is on the other if you take the other branch you also learn 1 get the average amount of information you will multiply what you learn on the first branch times the probability you take that plus what you learn on the second branch times the probability of that times 1 plus times 1 is bit plus or total 1 bit of what you can expect to learn on average from that the other suppose you are doing linear search in a table of 1024 the first the probability of yes is so the entropy of yes at that decision times 10 about if the answer is you learn 10 but the chance of that is about 1 in a the other no is much more entropy roughly 1 times roughly zero about the two and on average you will learn about of a bit on that why linear search is the entropy much you can expect to at each decision is too since going to have to learn 10 bits to find the entry in the

 error means that sometime in the future the compiler will behave the way you expect it to behave it compile the source file when you directly access an instance variable outside the defined visibility now the compiler simply enforcing the visibility the warning is to remind you that doing something that you be doing and bring you attention to that in case you did it by i had to hazard a guess as to why the visibility say that with all the bridging stuff between the foundation library and the corefoundation there is probably a decent amount of library code that accesses instance variables strictly should not be a bad idea to directly access instance variable as long as you can use probably better to use something like properties if designing a model	
 error means that there is a symbol that has been defined in one place and an alternate definition has been made in another can occur if in cases you define two functions with the same there is a mismatch between a function and call a function before it has been and without a this last case there will be a mismatch between the real function and the that the compiler assumes when it have a prototype to situations can be avoided that function prototypes are only declared that all functions have unique names within their scope within a file if they are or unique if they are used between object careful if using statements in source files to declare better to use a prototype from the appropriate header that all functions have prototypes either within the source file in the case of or in a header file if they are to be used by other object that all header files can only be included once for each source by using either of the constructs suggested by mehrdad and brian

 exactly does not deleting in the context of an avl could mean you do work on which is to you update the tree at will cause the tree to rebalance because the upward scan for balance factors will be working with incorrect balance could mean updating the balance factors but not means you would end when you did decide to delete with balance factors greater than 2 or smaller than which implies multiple rotations to the problem here though is that you can no longer upon a whether or not eliminated a subtree because although you know there are say 3 subtree depths too many on one you no longer know exactly one element which is causing each level of that extra depth something you normally know because adding or removing single elements at a time so you have no idea how many rotations you need to you might do three rotations and only have lost one subtree because there were two elements at that in how would you even be able to which elements to rotate to get at the necessary they necessarily all exist in the path from your chosen delete element and the point where the balance factor is not but go out on a limb and say lazy deletes breaks avl as we know would you want to the whole point of avl is to amortize the rebalance cost across each so you stay at why build up rebalance debt for less frequent

 exercise tells you to write two one that computes means of a recursive and another that computes means of an iterative you did the recursive since this function is very similar to the function given in the examples of the section you linked you should be able to figure this out by looking at the recursive and iterative examples of the n n n n 1 0 a b count a a count this case you would define an function which would take and arguments as well as a is the notice the similarity to a b c count a 2 3 a b count through a little trial and i found that and should be initialized to and which also follows the pattern of the function initializing and to and so looks like 2 1 0 is still a recursive but because of the way scheme it runs as an iterative and runs in time and unlike your code which is not only a recursive function but a recursive i believe this is what the author of exercise was looking	
 exist to store data until you are ready to send you have a send buffer size of until 256 characters are transmitted through the your data be sent to the other you can fix this by calling a flush method on your buffer when you know you are ready to be you are buffering then the os is buffering again when you call and pass some you get more specific with what library you are using and maybe include a code we can probably find the right buffer flush function to send you on your way if you are in just turn off algorithm so that the os buffer your small when you set up you make sure to use the

 expanded on the answer to answer some of the compiler takes the inner classes and turns them into since private methods are only available to the inner class the compiler has to add new methods that have package level access so that the classes have access to like this ones are added by the a private void final b b new call changed by the method generated by the compiler visible by classes in the same void private void final a a new call changed by the method generated by the compiler visible by classes in the same void classes are the but they have the addition of a reference to the outer class so that the methods can be called on reason java does it this way is that they did not want to require vm changes to support inner so all of the changes had to be at the compiler compiler takes the inner class and turns it into a top level class at the vm level there is no such thing as an inner the compiler then also has to generate the new they are made at the package level to ensure that only classes in the same package can access the compiler also updated the method calls to the private methods to the generated can avoid having the compiler generate the method my declaring the methods as absence of and the downside to that is that any class in the package can call the

 fact of the matter is that everyone understands it and part of writing better code is making it easy to read and	
 fact that these are in separate packages has nothing at all to do with the fact that this runs consuming all available calling two methods from within one this circular which is not the same in help you at get exactly the same effect a b best way to avoid this is do more if you have to write recursive functions try not to use multiple functions in the recursion but simply the so you have an easier time mentally keeping track of where your calls should to how to detect whether something like this is you would have to do something simple like increment a variable with your recursion depth and terminate if your depth exceeds a certain but you really have to rely on similar to writing a loop and using an increment there to make sure your function run out of just recurse over a set unless you know how and when it relevant question would be what are you trying to accomplish in the first

 fairly large ruby we have a situation where a given object is identified by a couple of name and each of these value types serves a somewhat different purpose and so are not exactly equivalent and name persist in different so we with a variety of values being passed around the application names and this situation seems like a problem to at least some degree since already been bitten by bugs which involved not being clear what type should be passed to a given i actually recall seeing similar problem code in a number of applications over the though i again never gave a specific name to as a typeless does not allow classical polymorphic functions in the way that as a work a colleague has often resorted code of this def initialize if elsif raise proliferation of this code around our just results in what i would call it often works but sometimes creates very puzzling have three questions about there a formal name for this as or something bad to do people think this there a systematic way to the challenge that we have refactoring that many tests created use this and thus we would have to change tests and the and so have the scaffold effect of ordinary i am think that one could actually this loose the code into a function rather than immediate rip it but would be a good

 fastest solution to this is to find the and then use that byte in a lookup this gives you a performance of four conditional instructions and a of not only is this the least amount of but the least amount of branches which is on modern table should contain the index of the lsb for each number in the range you check each byte of your value and find the lowest then use this value to lookup the real does require of but if the speed of this function is so important then that is well worth left as an exercise for the reader to note that order to check indices will depend whether you are on a big or little endian this is for bytes if return else if return else if return return

 feel the editor question has been fully many of the answers relating to that are very so allow me to discuss text editors from a bit of a wider standpoint i will admit my i use os i like i use i like emacs i like ides that and i like using closed source even though i admit that i never look very deep into the source code of what i i will one i definitive text editors for linux are and both of which are quite often used from the but both of which have quite wonderful graphical i personally am a vim but with a gui that suits my native environment i really like emacs especially for i personally find vim easier to both as a command line editor and as an whereas i never got the feel for emacs as a command line as a both emacs and vim are readily avaliable for and are almost ubiquitous on both have syntax highlighting for most major and are fully so that you can find syntax definitions for many or even write your own fairly i suggest you look at both of them a little and find the one you like the and learn it emacs is open source under the gnu and vim is open source under a charityware license that asks you to feed the children in but that is still very lot of people will extol the merits of the ide for especially in eclipse is a unlike vim and emacs which have little overhead and allow you to write a quick shell script as easily as a large and some find that a bit cumbersome for their but it suits others very it depends where you in web you could go either being more in the unix i tend to prefer leaner text editors to large but some from a windows background prefer the features of eclipse has good syntax highlighting for as well as a number of other popular languages languages very similar in syntax to expect good c and and possibly good perl and php eclipse is open source under a license with weaker copyleft provisions than the and is more whatever that is an amazing text editor for i really enjoyed using it when i had to do small amounts of work on and it made the time i spent on a windows box almost enjoyable fully admit my bias it works well with the overall windows almost as well as os x programs work and it supports a of languages i can only attest to the quality of the only in my largest drawback is that it is only avaliable for you can theoretically get it to work on linux with but i say that wine is ever the best solution to a problem like this if it works for go for is open source under the gnu people like my biggest beef with visual studio is that it is closed but i personally tried it because i almost never use so i can neither extol its virtues nor condemn its sure a great i just like ides and i like closed source some consider it the best editor on so i completely not mention all i can say is ask someone else about is getting so going to go ahead and post this is by no means a definitive list of text editors avaliable for windows and just a rundown of some of the more popular ones that aware if anyone notices that forgotten anything just comment and probably add

 for about a second the alt attribute given this case then it hides and shows the image when the image is what alt text is it provides a textual alternative for when the image because an or images are turned off in the browser in this the file just arrived alt text really what you unless the image in question actually contains the words the above is inappropriate alt if talking about one of those little icons that opens a a better alt text would be as a description of what the image opposed to what it would be better applied to the attribute used for that if using quirks mode and the image has a fixed size firefox will use a icon with the alt text overlaid and cropped instead of the plain alt text on its this is to match old but you really want to use quirks and in the common case where the fixed size is the cropping makes the alt text unreadable and is a problem because during that split second the layout stretches to fit the wider words making it look unprofessional in my getting over how the web any page can move about a bit as it renders for images you should only ever see it happen then the image will be cached and will appear straight if it something wrong with the cacheing on what kind of layout you are talking you can perhaps fix that to not respond to the changing image for example if using a setting on the table and number on the top image cell will make it stick to that width even if the text inside is possibly causing the alt text to run over into the next cell

 for real because all of java is still the application can use our existing common these libs have been built in java over the past 10 and important for access to other systems within the the most crucial thing about enterprise applications is getting too rigid is what makes most enterprise apps decay and eventually there are two problems that lead to this and scala helps avoid both of one problem is just the sheer volume of java works better than c or but it still requires many more lines of code to implement an application than scala combating the code size problem requires higher degrees of customizable why we deploy java ee apps that have twenty to fifty jar files in their that structure itself is necessary to get the app but it can create its own problem in terms of conceptual immune from an overload of conceptual but the common programming style in scala tends toward more concrete programs rather than libraries for frameworks for building if you actually do need libraries for frameworks for building where being able to call back into java comes in

 further support ivans answer above lucene is the way to you mentioned what platform on so point out that you can use a port of this you do use lucene there is a very good book from manning on the subject which i recommend you look it comes to populating your you have a couple of for starters you can just dump all of your text into the index and allow the engine to just search on recommend adding fixed fields to your index which will allow you to support things such as partitioned searches or searches against those fields lets say you have a field for the then you can partition your index by restricting the index search to those documents that have that website in that other process is to extract points of interest from your document and allow searches on those without searching the entire index your mileage may vary with this as the lucene engine is very well written so it may simply allow you to collect your searches into more logical units which helps you with your done this myself and it helps when answering management questions about what exactly is searched and

 general answer is you are not guaranteed that for the same numeric the long objects you get are the same if you restrict yourself to using it is possible that you would get a performance improvement by first trying to test the equality of references and if trying it all hinges on the comparative costs of the additional test and the method your mileage may but it is worth trying a simple loop test to see which is

 good generic solution is to use heap size this involves minimal effort and is between any type of object object by instantiating and destroying your objects many times and garbage collecting in and then taking the you avoid compiler and jvm optimizations that alter results and get a fairly accurate if you need an exact answer down to the byte then this may not be the solution for but for all practical applications that i know of memory requirement it works extremely the code below will do just public class sizeof public static void throws exception all that we are going to array to keep strong references to allocated final int count 10000 or so is enough for small objects new long heap1 allocate discard the first for i i object instantiate your data here and assign it to your code if else object discard the heap1 take a heap long heap2 take an heap final int size heap1 size size a helper method for creating strings of desired and avoiding getting tricked by string public static string int final result new for i i return new this is our way of requesting garbage collection to be aggressive it is depends on the jvm to a large it is almost always better than a single private static void throws exception for whatever reason it helps to call using several method for r r private static void throws exception long usedmem1 usedmem2 for i usedmem2 usedmem1 private static long return private static final runtime end of

 good really tough such as numerical routines that run for a long time and get slightly different answers from what they used to there is a laborious method that usually one foot on each side of the problem and work toward the get an older version of the program that got the right and the newer one that incrementally make changes to either one to bring them closer still keeping one on one side of the and the other on the you find the one change that makes the run an older good version of the program under a and the newer bad version also under a at the same single step them until they do something then homing in on the step at which they start to found this method is applicable to all kinds of difficult not just

 good way to identify this issue if it comes up again is to click on the root add folder path to the shown then click the all descendants sort the files by and look for the unknown files and see if multiple files of the same name are checking out to the same usually this is the result of a mistaken or a change in folder it is undetermined what order starteam will check files having two different files with the same name pointing to the same local location is a the 2005r2 native windows client and cross platform client would pull files in a slightly different causing views with this issue to produce checkouts with different are a few ways to legitimately end up with this situation keeping multiple branches of a single file on the tip and designating which to use by view label is a common starteam is one of the few vcs that can handle multiple references like if you can help never delete and a of the it what you want to a file to the server gives it a whole new archive in the database and it will not be tied in any way to existing shares of that you will also lose all of your revision look for ways to move and if you have multiple files with the same name and content on your it is usually a good idea to make an effort to share the file to the various places it should exist rather than this will make sure your changes propagate so you need to fixes multiple

 gstring concept in groovy is pretty powerful let you do things hello program trying to figure out if using groovy can introduce security problems in your code similar to sql injection the example above the code was written by the author of the so the execution of the command cannot be seen as a security flaw as it was the stated intent of the say writing a grails where user input is taken from form fields and database tables assume that an attacker controls both sent as requests to the server and in the code in my app looks like str1 str2 here is some and there any way an attacker can execute code in the above why my initial hypothesis is that gstring usage is always please feel free to prove me please be as concrete as to keep the discussion please disregard any problems in the code since this question is about on the not on the some people have pointed out that it is a good idea to filter out unwanted while filtering out bad might certainly save you from some classes of security it would be even better to write code that would be safe even without you can compare it with usage of preparedstatements in the java jdbc api correct usage of preparedstatements is to save you from certain classes of injection filtering your sql input will probably give you the same but using preparedstatements strictly dominates the filtering approach use of in

 guess you are using i am having the same sporadically i would find this exception in my event and the requested path is always fixed validationkey and decryptionkey in machinekey did not fix the problem for on what i was able to i tend to believe that this error has nothing to do with the viewstate my theory is that for some certain uas somehow mess up the parameter of the the problem is easily replicable by requesting the offending path this gives an even though viewstate even apply through my i found for request is served ok slightly different request is also served ok request fails with a 500 response and the invalid viewstate you look the first few characters on all three request are the but the last few characters of the last request clearly is control id have a controls named products and i know how this id got but in my case this is what is causing all these invalid viewstate not sure whether this is the same case as the op or but i notice request url ends in which is a bit of a coincidence for a parameter that is supposed to be a already have a headache thanks to this and so the most insightful post i came across is this one

 has recently put a release of their framework on devlabs with a commercial interested on using them in our project some to gradually replace all the custom validation but keen to know about the experience other people have had with it before we commit to you think the framework is sufficiently mature for large and complex commercial problems have you run into while using benefits have you got from it currently more pain than realise that this is a somewhat subjective question as it requires but given that this framework is a very significant part of and will change the way we all write validation i hope that this question will be left open to gather experience on the subject to help me make a decision to a answerable we be starting to use it next that we do not ship a code only a web service so for the majority of code breaking compatibility in terms of the exception type thrown is not a as hoping more people than just me will benefit from this post and its any detail around this area is more than mature is the microsoft code contracts

 have a rails application where i would like to use both memcached and the file store for different want to use the file store cache to keep a large number of pages that change often not at page caching and use memcached for everything else and db caching the reason is that the pages stored on the file store cache are likely to require a large amount of but individually most will be accessed this possible to do or will configuring memcached as the cache mean that it is also used for page a secondary what is a safe way to remove pages from the file store cache in some form of cron as there does not seem to be an option to specify ttl for this for example a unix find command would quickly find and remove all old pages or pages that been accessed in a long time is this safe to do given the app server might potentially try to serve one of those pages at the time this is very if not then what is the best way to do to use multiple caches in

 have an application that performs a write to a database each time a page is this db write is not time so for performance i have the page queuing the object using of i have to have something to read the queue and process so i wrote a class that looks similar to class queueprocessor public void create background thread to run public void stop the previously created public void while check queue for process them one at a then wait indefinitely for more since this web site is fairly small in i realy want to have to add a windows service to the deployment so what doing at this time is creating a new queueprocessor in the event and starting it my thought is that the thread will run for the life of the and if the application gets killed by it will merely start up again the next time someone accesses a prevent long periods of idle where queued messages are not processed because the application has been killed by set up a wget request to execute every few minutes on one of the thus keeping the application alive and ensuring the background thread will keep question i see this design very and wondering if there are any potential problems with doing some reading on the i found that the major problem with this approach similar such as the cache removal callback is the type of function they were being asked to perform with regards to for if doing a mass update or you obviously want the task running on all of your web servers have conflicting updates and potential data loss that in my very particular the thread is processing only requests received by that server that are sitting in that message if i were to scale this app to say 5 each thread would process each queued messages without any the order of the records in the database so important that a few similar requests from different servers within a small interval would be a so i still think this solution is reasonable for my threading design

 have based many designs and frameworks that use attributes over the past 4 or 5 lately i see many people openingly discouraging their use or changing their frameworks to reduce the need or use of found them to be a godsend but now i am starting to wonder what i am convention over configuration is becoming a major principle to follow especially in the orm is this area you can map fields with a config file use an or have a common naming convention that maps directly to fields in your database i have any references to quote but i have read some backlash against adding another attribute to the i feel over the three choices i just listed that attributes still make the most a config file is harder to maintain and a common naming convention ties you to the implementation of the database attributes are placed exactly where they are needed and the implemntation can change without disconnecting from where it is you think attributes similar are a good idea or do you discourage the use of

 have been extremely i have been developing a piece of software the only for a little while over the course of a few but have not used any sort of source have resolved to use source control seems most as the windows tools seem to have come on a lot on the last few from now what i do have is dated backups of the entire directory of my i would like to do is automagically have my backups visible in the revision it will be projects and files will have been over the course of the solution not bothered about such problems as what i know to be renamed files being interpreted as removal of a file and addition of a unrelated generally my problem i have time ordered copies of a changing importing the first into git is easy i i then want all subsequent copies of the directory to be in date one at a time without me having to commit every and file this or is it just that i am punished for not using source control from the if i go ahead with the all snapshots method manually are less than 20 is there a way esko luontola suggests i might want of overriding the commit dates with the dates i have for the git commit does not appear to have a flag to allow is there another way using in answer to my issue of using the original you have to set the environment variables to override the use of current dates and times when performing the reason there are two sets of variables are also is to distinguish the author who emails a and the maintainer who is actually doing the commits into the if using git extensions on if you set these variables using the command and then switch back to the gui to do a it seems to ignore you have to stay on the command line and run from do i convert simple non source controlled project backups into a versioned git	
 have been following the discussion on the on ext4 that causes files to be zeroed in crash if one uses the temp write temp rename temp to target posix says that unless is you cannot be sure the data has been flushed to get the file contents it or make it open original file and truncate write new close not good even with as the computer can crash during or and you end up with partially written it has been thought that this is pretty get the file contents it or make it open temp write contents to temp close temp rename temp file to original it to make it safe on ext4 you would need to get the file contents it or make it open temp write contents to temp close temp rename temp file to original would be safe and on crash you should either have the new file contents or never zeroed contents or partial but if the application uses lots of after every write would be my question how to modify multiple files efficiently on a system where is required to be sure that changes have been saved to and i really mean modifying many as in thousands of modifying two files and doing after each be too but does slow things down when modifying multiple changed the close temp file to corrent added emphasis on writing many many many and efficient way to modify multiple files on posix

 have been your situation senior year of high school in an internship i c and shell programming mostly via copy and and later on at various times when i may have been in a similar situation with specific a class at your the one you want is the one that is the prerequisite for the advanced programming they probably also offer a never touched a computer level class but this one be the formal prereq for the follow on this will probably be in your way through one of the better programming books that includes kernighan and c programming language is a this would be my recommendation because c is similar enough to php to be but different enough that you will be able to keep them i say this even though you will probably never write a single line of production paul ansi common lisp is also a suitable you are really hard core and have the you can try structure and interpretation of computer by abelson and this is the book used in the first programming course at uc berkeley and at mit this may be too difficult to attempt outside a school designed for bright young students with nothing to do but study and with the regular opportunity to get tutoring from grad i include it only for would avoid any web programming you already know web i get the impression that you are feeling like you are hitting a bit of a and looking at a way around or over that rather than trying to go directly through would advise against looking into any web oriented book because it will not give you the big it will describe technique only as they apply to web the important things to understand are how a computer actually the difference between the stack and the the basics of garbage and probably be helpful to understand at least extension i if you understand shared libraries on or dlls on or classpath and jars on or how to create a library in perl or any one of those will be just the concept of loading outside code

 have code running in an ascx within pagelayout within sharepoint 2007 that accesses files on a remote server the code runs within a sharepoint web application that has cas trust set to full in the the throws the following to the path is share is shared to everyone with full control and the ntfs permissions are set to everyone with full the web application app pool is running under a domain account also with explicit permissions to access that resource that this should be ran process monitor on the remote machine and no hits were being recorded on the this leads me to believe that it is an issue with the sharepoint code access security like said the trust in the is set to it possible that cas is still blocking the remote can anyone think of any other area to bit more tried making the app pool acct domain admin and the problem still when using the same method to access a drive on the local machine it works running the same code in snippetcompiler outside of sharepoint using the app pool account works this let me know if you can think of any more avenues of investigation or tests i can not sure if this would affect the issue but the local server is running windows server 2003 and the remote server is running windows just tried running the code through a web part and it works the file structure i use in the project that is failing is as web app in iis i have the following sharepointwebapp to pagelayoutcontrols directory pointing to within the pagelayouts i reference the controls using the register me know if you need more mystery i access the sharepoint site from internet explorer or on the sharepoint web front end server i do not get the i access the sharepoint site from mozilla firefox from the sp web front end server i do get the i access the sharepoint site remotely from any browser i get the it makes no difference what user i use to log on to the as long as they have permissions to access the sharepoint now found that if i access the sharepoint site remotely and the sharepoint site tries to do a locally then it if i access the sharepoint site from the sharepoint box and do a remotely then it only fails when i access the sharepoint site remotely and have the sharepoint site try to do a remotely as kind of a double hop this makes me think it may be an ntlm kerberos we are running using ntlm anyone else experienced this sort of pretty sure this is an ntlm issue not allowing a double i just changed the authentication on the sharepoint site to use basic authentication and its changed it back to integrated authentication and it to decide whether to move the farm to use kerberos or find another way around the giving a shot one thing is runwithelevatedprivileges meant to be used in this only used it to get access to lists and libraries within sharepoint rather than accessing a file access the resolves the 2007 remote file access denied

 have learned to avoid all but the simplest i far prefer other models such as string scanning or parsing in both of these models you can write code that has the same privileges and status as the string if i were programming in perl i would probably rig up some parsing combinators in done it for other very nice alternative is to use parsing expression grammars as roberto ierusalimschy has done with his but unlike parser combinators this is something you whip up in an but if somebody has already done pegs for your platform a very nice alternative to regular

 have much experience designing though i have some rough theoretical on to my we have data on a bunch of excel files and we want to move them to a say the system is a centralized alarm data get collected from remote locations and displayed in a centralized monitoring location have a unique name and multiple within a device name is unique and the device have multiple and within a an alarm name is each location we have one or more terminal unit that aggregates the alarms in that location and send each tu have a bunch of cards within each with unique per each card have a wiring termination contact for each alarm with a unique address per of these entities can be you see the data is highly and i need to store the history of each wiring assignment an alarm can change assignment from one contact to device card alarm created a table for each entity shown i used artificial primary keys for all of them as a table down in the hierarchy will have a uniqueness constraint on the composition where tn is a table depth in the hierarchy and is the primary key of a will be using sql server and having doubts with the integers say i have 10 records and i deleted all but the last will the next added record be numbered or will the dbms renumber them as and new if the former is how to solve the problem of pk question is how should i model historical data for thinking i should create table with relationship to my db	
 have much experience managing but i work on an application that works like is an interface for the users to select a report they want to view from a list of this list is populated by a reports table in the database which holds info like the report the file and which parameters the report are several common parameters in these reports they are or sorting so the user might pull up a report about all the widgets numbered 200 through grouped by now a person develops a stored and the report file at the same they pass it off to and i have to deploy it by running the sproc script in and moving the file to the right i then have to insert a record into the reports table with the and is a logistical challenge because no great way to keep track of which reports have been deployed onto which systems because they are mean they are there are 4 systems total that ideally should and there are several points of failure the params in the sproc match the params in the the params in the reports table match the params in the or the sproc is updated while the file for whatever what happens when a new report needs a parameter that been coded for in the params all boils down to the system not being dynamic like i i know about but i have a feeling that the guy doing the reports it seems like there must be a better way to keep the sproc and file in and to dynamically ask for the parameters it needs through something like is this normally reports best

 have read a ton of posts and articles about all of these languages and the good and bad of i realize that some folks will say another language and frankly i i am genuinely curious about this and i think it is an interesting question for healthy i would like to learn a language that will teach good programming fundamentals while also allowing to get something up ultimately i would like to be able to create sites and web it would also be nice to be able to find some work in the event that i ever reach a level of expertise where that may be a started and switched between several platforms and one problem with a few was all of the required components and modules that were required from different vendors with aptana and zend caused some issues in setting one thing that i really liked about the platform is that it is a cohesive environment with lots and lots of documentation that all works together quite i know that the possibility exists for some cost issues down the road though not sure how applicable this would be to a with smaller while i think is a great language that would teach good is it realistic to gain some level of competence in a shorter period of time given also looked at java and it seemed like it may be overkill for what trying to do though i state that with any seems like a great web development language that a lot of huge sites have been built with but one concern that i keep hearing over and over is the tendency to fall into poor habits with it this is a possibility with all i want one that minimized that potential given a reasonable amount of cost issues seem to be much less of an issue with php and it seems to be ubiquitous with heard great things about python and i went through some tutorials but it seems that been such a pain in the ass getting it to work as a cohesive system the way i know django is supposed to be great but it was also a pain in the ass to get seems enjoyable to learn but does teach the fundamentals the best does it matter in the end if it gets me going plus there seem to be a lot of jobs the way there are with php and would at least be nice to be able to do some freelance work at some is a highly subjective question so apologies for that as well as the length of any help would be much teetering on the verge of concentrating on one of several languages and your guidance would really what language should i learn for web development that allows a novice to get up reasonably quickly and teaches good habits such that it would be somewhat easy to pick up new and php for learning fundamentals and

 hit this issue about two years ago when i first implemented our swig as soon as we exposed a large amount of code we got to the point where swig would output files so large the compiler could not handle the only way i could get around the issue was to split up the interfaces into multiple modules and to compile them has several each module must know about dependencies in other i have a script to generate the interface files which handles this side of but it adds extra each additional module increases the time that the dynamic linker requires to load in the i have added an file that imports all the so that the fact that the code is split up is transparent to the but what is always visible is the long load currently reviewing our build scripts build process and i wanted to see if i could find a solution to this issue that was better than what i have have one shared library containing all the wrapper anyone know how i can acheive this with seen some custom code written in ruby for a specific where the output is to make this but when i looked at the feasibility for python wrappers it does not look so it possible to split a swig module for but rejoin it when

 how hard it is to find information about custom component setup i thought i would clear up some aspects of the process based on what i have the most part aaaidan example above is correct with one loaderinfo property of a displayobject refrences a loaderinfo from which your component gets its parameter settings the init event is called when it has gotten its data you could use the complete which should fire directly after the your setting up properties to be accessed using the metadata you can also define default values what i have experience the parameters seem to have trouble dealing with anything other then a string perhaps so i would suggest using set functions that take string values and use them to obtain the other values you may for example if you want to load a new instance of a specific named function set var as new this example if the parameter is set to calling will create a new sprite you want your custom component to resize in a way other then simply stretching the height and width values you need a public setsize this function will be called every time you resize your component in function this works great when your resizing the component in flash but once you actually publish your swf file you will notice that it switches back to stretching width and height rather then using your setsize function dont know why but thats what it to fix in your oninit function you need to take the width and feed them into your and then reset the scalex and scaley values back to 1 function scalex scaley other functions that need to be run once the parameters are anyone finds a less messy way of doing this let this helps someone get their custom components up and

 huge problem that caused us a lot of grief was using modules classes in our main web this was before we really knew what we were doing and has since been big problem with using modules is that by default any module level variables are visible to every instance of the asp worker we pass in multiple datasets and manipulate them then return them to the because we were using modules the variables holding these datasets were getting corrupted by multiple calls occuring at one was not caught in testing and was difficult to reproduce until we figured out how to properly load test our web it took something like requests per second before we could reproduce it the we just changed all the modules to and then used those classes instead of calls to the this cleared up this concurrency issue as each instantiated class had its own copy of the dataset in

 i always do with table design is look at it and work out what sort of trouble i can get into what inconsistencies can be your particular the obvious one is that you could create an address in the state of wyoming and in the city of which is in the state of i mean texas you could have an address that is in the country of australia the state of texas the the city of in peru in south i want to have to explain your schema to the postman when he tracks you do you resolve you should probably only reference the city from the then the state from the then the country from the addresses are a tricky beast and the form they take depends a great deal on where they are some have some cities cross state boundaries and so you have a dire need for finding people in specific just incorporate that into a address places have postcodes of some sort which is a better choice for you may well want to select by state or in which case leave those as separate first attempt would have would have to distinguish between states in different countries washington and western australia both being but you could easily show the country in data entry screens so that the operator knows which state entering more choose the country first and the choices of state will be whittled xolotllotl is not a real city as far as i just one i made up that sounds like those beautiful incan names of

 i am counting on my system call to write say 100 i always put that call in a loop that checks to see if the length that gets returned is what i expected to send if it bumps the buffer pointer and decreases the length by the amount that was once again i just did but now that i can ask you all if people know when my writes will write all that i ask for versus give me back a partial reply reminded me that i should have noted that the file descriptor was blocking not i think he is suggesting that the only way a on a blocking file descriptor will not write all the specified data is when the is interrupted by a this seems to make at least intuitive sense to does the system call write all of the requested buffer versus just doing a partial

 i have the following interfaces and a class that implements them interface following code prints a a as if supports writeln writeln is a little annoying but supports cast to ibase because ibase is not in the list of guids that timplementation it can be fixed by changing the declaration to even without doing that i that a implements ibase because a is an iderived and an iderived is an so if i leave out the check i can cast a and everything will be fine a b a as b now successfully call any of we come across a problem when we start putting ibases into a generic container tinterfacelist for it can only hold iinterfaces so we have to do some a b list a as b list assert assertion i declared dowhatever in this works but it is not would very much like to have some sort of assertion to catch any mismatched types this sort of thing can be done with objects using the is but that work for for various i want to explicitly add ibase to the list of supported is there any way i can write timplementation and the assertion in such a way that it will evaluate to true iff is a safe thing to it came up in the one of the adding the two major reasons i do not want to add ibase to the list of interfaces that timplementation it actually solve the in the this does not mean it is safe to perform a queryinterface may return a different pointer to satisfy the requested for if timplementation explicitly implements both ibase and iderived then the assertion will pass does implement imagine that somebody mistakenly adds an item to the list as an as assertion still passes the item still implements but the reference added to the list is an iinterface only it to an ibase would not produce anything so the assertion sufficient in checking whether the following is the only way guaranteed to work would be to use an or as this is a frustrating performance as it is intended to be the responsibility of the code adding items to the list to ensure they are of the type ibase we should be able to assume this the assertion to catch if this assumption is the assertion even except to catch later mistakes if anyone changes some of the the original code this problem comes from is also fairly performance so a performance cost that achieves little still only catches mismatched types at but without the possibility to compile a faster release is something rather second reason is i want to be able to compare references for but this be done if the same implementation object is held by different references with different vmt expanded the above edit with an the question is how can i formulate the assertion so that the is safe iff the assertion not how to avoid the there are ways to do the step or to avoid it but if there is a runtime performance i use i want all the cost of checking within the assertion so that it can be compiled out said if someone can avoid the problem altogether with no performance cost and no danger that would be how can you check if an iinterface reference implements a derived but not

 i kind of figured it out you do the division by by converting the bytes into a single number you will get using the smallest kind of byte which is 6 bits in knuths divide this by which is the value in location 1000 using the same quotient is the remainder the sign will be postive since both numbers are if you store 1644545 in ra and 65 in you will the smallest bytesize holds 64 since knuth never assumes a particular bytesize in his rx has a number of question the sign of rx is always the previous sign of i used the very handy utilty to play around with the registers of this is a pretty nice mix implementation done in

 i posted a question so i could confirm our current version of informix you jonathan and ret for clearing that are definitely planning on upgrading but are first discussing if it would make more sense to move to oracle or sybase at this what are your opinions on my belief that while all 3 rdbms have their own they must all cover the same ground so how does one go about deciding what database to big kicker is i need to know if we upgrade informix using will we need to modify our embedded sql c if then it makes a lot of sense to stick with because if we went with have a lot of work on our hands to update the if switching to another database can offer great return in comparison then we will still consider i look forward to hearing your informix switch to sybase or stay with	
 i propose a somewhat unorthodox would you think about placing the column after the rather than at the very this avoid the requirement for only a portion of the table to not exactly what asking but perhaps it is a sufficient given that the alternative would be pretty the and columns outside of the for would create alignment problems when not all rows are of equal you could correct this with javascript but then be entering a whole new world of from a ui it may be that and are the most important in which case it would make sense to put them followed by a sort of of the of we seem to have an intuition that a should come after its constituent but i think it would cause too much confusion to the user if the order were reversed like this this is a question for based on your product and your something to are some more unorthodox now that i think i understand your intentions a bit the give the most recent and the link to older which are provided 10 at a time give and some other meaningful as mean and then link for each name that results corresponding to you could then also link showing all results for score so that comparisons between different users be the point is that have to give 1 dimension for each rather an unwieldy 2d data the rows sortable with jquery so that if i want mary to i can drag one after the so i to keep scrolling left to see which scores which a row when it is by changing the or again so i need to keep scrolling left and you get the perhaps it is better to look for a ui solution than a contorted markup ultimately i would be questioning how important it is to present so much data to the user at that a portion of it needs to scroll in a particular fashion for the data to be perhaps building a spreadsheet and you really do need to display a 100x100 matrix in a single if you could surely come up with more creative ways than i have to split up the

 i sometimes find that private inner classes which implement a public interface can be very helpful for objects composed of seen this discussed in the context of creating uis with allen but not much beyond as far as i know it have a say you have a collection interface that can provide an interface public iterator interface public boolean public object you have a stack that implements then you could implement its iterator as a private inner class stack implements public iterator return new private class iteratorimpl implements public boolean public object has complete access to all of private methods and at the same is invisible to all except stack and its iterator will tend to be tightly worst implementing iterator as a public class might force you to break the private inner class lets you avoid either you avoid polluting the class hierarchy with something really an implementation

 i take into web to mean that just learning web programming in if if you have the time you might consider setting java aside temporarily and giving a closer look as eddie personally use perl instead of php is sexier resume fodder and lets you do some very cool things on the front but in my when it comes to writing code perl simply blows doors and heard that the extension puts perl on pretty even footing with but i used it made a living writing writing web apps in java and web apps in fond of both but as a learning put perl well ahead of as finding a bulky part of that as others have a function of java being a mature language with a variety of extensions that are unlikely to apply to your immediate but even stripped still need to deal with quite a bit of overhead before you can even get your first web app to get rolling much quicker with java tends to be pretty verbose in general compared with other not necessarily a bad my one big complaint with perl is you often encounter code that leverages various shortcuts and side effects to do an unholy ton of work in just a few this code is often and utterly bloody unintelligible to a terseness is not a virtue for the poor idiot who has to modify code six months after it was written especially when you wind up being the poor idiot in as a way of learning web sophistication can actually work against as a glad tools automagically take care of a lot of grunt work for like session but i completely what it was doing until i was thrown into a environment and had to deal with all that stuff guess it depends on why doing this and how much time you can devote to if time is limited and looking for something that will appeal to prospective then an excellent and gotten some solid advice in this thread about how to get started using if you do have the i highly recommend giving programming a it a particularly marketable skillset but learn things worth

 i think probably not considering the use of messaging an mom instance or any other mom on a case really make sense best to think of your mom broker as a router of that you would have one activemq broker instance might be sharded or otherwise scaled if you have scaling or replicated if you have ha which all producers and all consumers connect then all xml goes to the same broker and all consumers read from the same broker in that the broker will determine which consumer the message should go to based on any heuristics it also means that you can add and remove producers and consumers and nothing ever they all connect to the same so you can add and remove producers and consumers as your load changes or as systems

 i understand i think the problem here is that trying to solve the problem using a very simple what you need to be doing is creating your own workflow system for such a task and also try to separate out some of the logic from the ui handling mvc framework would be ideal for though i see you are using which nonetheless a big now this necessarily need to be start off by breaking down the actions performed by your application into some sort of flow if you can see pretty straightforward then it may just be a matter of implementing a basic state as a general pointer to dealing with states in web applications all have a read through some of the links on afraid i really provide you with anything more specific from what described missing something obvious if like to clarify the tasks that your app needs to then i might be able to give some code but i suspect that just treating this problem a flow perspective should give you a good

 i was doing something like cross platform cross language i would create a since the languages are similar in syntax you could make a translator easy then instead of calling java or apis directly from the you would call your which would re implement the java and apis you would in this way you could create a cross language sandbox if you since the main differences in java and are object i would get those by reflecting the and then reconstruct the then it would be easy to have an interpreter run through and implement the function bodies and convert properties to getters setters already knowing the structure of the this of course is assuming some of the features in and become very difficult to would be but probably not as complex as reconstructing a core in java by and having to have 2 teams working on them if this idea sparks some inspiration i might create i would really rather see a simpler stable mono installation for i think a code level interpreter based on a set of common api classes is something very possible to write with a team in a week or

 i was talking with a friend of mine who had started a class a couple months ago first exposure to we got onto the topic of and and he made the point to me that he felt it was for all of the issues breakable i agreed with him on all those but i held back in saying it was only because i felt in languages like could instead become native code microsoft so chose to change the implementation of from a jit runtime environemnent to one which compiles directly to native code like your program question am i out to lunch i it may take a lot of work may break too many but there some type of magical barrier which prevents code from being compiled natively one wanted to do there was a time where was considered a very language it still but not as much as in the yet now the bedrock with for native the idea that could one day be on the same level as in that respect seems only to be a matter of time and effort to not some fundamental flaw in the design of the i should add that if native compilation of is why does microsoft choose not to go that why have they chosen the jit bytecode managed code ever become

 i would not update an id field this i would create a work table that is the old to new it stores both ids and then all the updates are done from if you are not using cascade delete could incidentally lock your tables for a long then start with the child tables and work other wise start with the pk do not do this unless you are in single user mode or you can get some nasty data integrity problems if other users are changin things while the tables are not consistent with each are nothing to fool around with changing and if at all possible should not be you do any changes to production data in this make sure to take a full messing this up can cost you your job if you

 idea of storing connection strings in a data base is a perverse but please hear me out we all know that best practice to encrypt connection strings in the but what if we just skip the file couple of months ago i was asked to move databases from one server to this meant having to update connection strings in every program that accessed these various this is the 3rd time in 2 years had to move databases from one server to so i thought of storing connection strings in a database and assigning each a guid to be accessed via a web instead of placing connection strings in a you would just need to store the connection string guid in the and reference the connection string web service so that you could request that connection encryption can be done at the application level and connection strings are just stored encrypted in the created a proof of concept and it works fine just on a local intranet and not exposed to the benefit is obvious to such as being able to quickly update connection strings without having to touch the web this means that you could build a web application just for editing connection string in the that a dba could use on there so they never have to bother a programmer when moving the benefit is not what interested interested in what everyone here thinks about doing something like connection strings via a web

 in they do different if the evaluated value is a user type and is very rarely the reason anyone would choose one way around over the if is not including if the type of the value has a conversion from then you have a problem that probably wants fixing rather than working brian and are probably on the mark for why anyone worries about it in the fact remains that even if is the compiler might not do the same thing in each it will return the same but it might do things in a slightly different or

 incorrect response you are getting is most likely coming from a can use an header to find out what caching headers your server is sending or you can be certain with the addon for you are looking out header tells the browser to the same page for further requests before a certain without checking from the the same is true for a section within a that if you are seeing an expires header or then the browser may return a stale page without going back to the vaguely possible that your or a proxy server between your browser and your is adding cache validators like these to your pages whereas your server on your localhost if you could try to remove maybe the server admin has configured could override that in an if caused by a proxy server between your browser and your you may not have much few other things of should be using a post request rather than a get request if it is important that a certain action changes something on the responses to post requests are never cached if you do then the get after it may but another that your browser caching may behave differently when you are accessing something at compared to accessing it at any other even if the servers are configured the same and sending the same this is at least the case for firefox seen it ie also has different security which could plausibly affect making it behave differently on may force your server to output a header and a this could be done in php using two calls to the while browsers and proxies be defaulting to behaviour that can return a stale result when no validator is this at least makes it explicit that you absolutely want something also that if you are accessing the web via a proxy server this can also be affecting including which caching headers you

 inference is a feature of some it is done by the compiler to assign types to entities that otherwise lack any type the compiler effectively just the static type information on behalf of the inference tends to work more poorly in languages with many implicit coercions and so most type inferenced languages are functional languages with little in the way of inference is part of the language for the example the spec goes into great detail about the type inference algorithm and as this effectively determines is a legal some languages support some limited forms of type inference in for the most part people use to refer to languages where the vast majority of types are inferred rather than explicit in function and method in addition to local are typically contrast to where allows inference of local variables but method declarations require full type

 input text often has characters which are incorrect for the output things like which come from a document in 147 and 148 in are perfectly valid unicode and your application should be capable of handling them if doing something wrong and most likely all characters will of whether the characters came from someone typing them or someone pasting them in from the browser should be submitting characters to your which should be storing the same bytes to the the browser is not submitting in chances are failing to set the charset of the html page containing the this can be done using header in i just set the attribute on the form and have the browser do it for is basically useless thanks to which misinterprets it to mean using this charset if the one on the page encode the characters we instead of use this this means if you use you can end up with a mixture of encodings submitted at with no way to figure out which is come my database is accepting these which are characters in mysql is just a used for comparison and still storing the data as bytes and really care if not valid a good idea to decode and check incoming sequences in your app because invalid in modern can hide a character that will still be recognised by older browsers least ie6 opera i entered a string containing byte you entered a unicode character the browser deals with unicode not right up until the point it has to submit the serialised form to the then that it decides how to turn the characters into and if the page is being handled as it will always choose not browsers tend to cheat in a for all characters that fit in the encode them to html character references like this is wrong because you now tell the difference between a and a and insidiously wrong because if you then echo the reference as unescaped html it looks like getting it which in fact just made a big old security went into the database as a not or came out when i produced the as no complaints from the it did not come out as a single a browser will complain when given a bare in an xml an html in which invalid sequences come out as a suspect it is coming out as a character which is the character is part of the c1 control so render as anything if this is your form page is not being picked up as after and suffering the problem described

 intel platform the explanation is the when you declare on stack the compiler really allocates 8 bytes because of then typical for functions to have the following saves ebp registry value on then moves esp register value into ebp for using esp value to access the this leads to 4 more bytes on stack to be occupied with ebp the epilogue ebp is but its value is usually only used for accessing function so overwriting it may not hurt in most you have the following layout grows downwards on 8 bytes for your then 4 bytes for then usually the return is why you need to overwrite at least 13 bytes to crash your

 is a huge and employs many techniques to achieve the high compression rates that it is capable video compression is concerned with throwing away as much information as possible whilst having a minimal effect on the viewing experience for an end for using subsampled yuv instead of rgb cuts the video size in half straight this is possible as the human eye is less sensitive to colour than it is to in the y value is and the u and v values represent you can throw away some of the colour information which reduces the file without the viewer noticing any most compression techniques take advantage of 2 redundancies in the first is temporal redundancy and the second is spatial redundancy notes that successive frames in a video sequence are very typically a video would be in the order of frames per and nothing much changes in of a take any dvd and pause then move it on one frame and note how similar the 2 images instead of encoding each frame other compression only encode the difference between successive frames to find the difference between redundancy takes advantage of the fact that in general the colour spread across images tends to be quite low by this i mean that neighbouring pixels tend to have similar for in an image of you wearing a red all of the pixels that represent your jumper would have very similar it is possible to use the dct to transform the pixel values into the frequency where some high frequency information can be thrown when the reverse dct is performed the image is now without the thrown away view the effects of throwing away high frequency open ms paint and draw a series of overlapping horizontal and vertical black save the image as a jpeg also uses dct for now zoom in on the notice how the edges of the lines are not as sharp anymore and are kinda this is because some high frequency information transition from black to has been thrown away during this for an explanation with nice further is quite if a little heavy on the

 is a pretty standard scheme for asynchronous background processing with vb6 clients and vb6 instance in dan and i think it should work for a client vb6 activex exe object should expose an event this takes a byref boolean called client calls startdostuff in the activex exe this routine starts a timer on a hidden form and this unblocks the calling the timer interval is very short so the timer event fires timer event handler disables the and then calls back into the activex object dostuff this begins the lengthy the dostuff method raises the checkquitdostuff the event handler checks the special flag and sets quit true if necessary to then dostuff aborts the calculation and returns early if quit is scheme means that the client actually need to be since the calling thread block while is the tricky part is making sure that dostuff raises the events at appropriate intervals too and you quit when you want too and you are slowing down dostuff when dostuff it must unload the hidden dostuff does actually manage to get all the stuff done before being you can raise a different event to tell the client that the job is	
 is a pretty subjective but i think the decision needs to boil down to two the performance of retrieving an entire object only for the purposes of determining and the idea of allowing information to reach a greater will argue that allowing the application to make greater use of this identifying information increases your chances of bypassing the object model but i generally err on the side of performance in these specific advice is to go with the former approach invalidate the

 is a quite common situation in our applications that some entity have to be represented by an for example and things like there are conditions or flows in the code that use the values to decide between one action or so the values have to be in some way for the application it has to be able to refer to a specific instance to decide instead of referencing the class in a that is why we use enums instead of just a regular problem is that these entities also need to be stored at least in the as fields of other we usually create a table for each to be capable of having referencial integrity checks in these and also that the data have a in the database alone without the need to refer to the enum to find out what each id the data for these entities should be populated from the data in the but nowadays we have the values duplicated in the db initialization becomes a bit more complicated when an orm like hibernate is like to know how other people handles this kind of not fully comfortable with the idea of having a duplication between an enum and a database but i found a better solution to handle duplication between java enum and database

 is definitely the operating system can fetch from the disk to the cache while your code is processing the data already the disk may well still be the bottleneck but you have but for suppose we have processing which takes half the time of representing time going down the we might have this sort of activity without with this is optimised the total time will be to read whole file time to process last piece of instead of to read whole file time to process whole it is tricky need to have an operating system where you can tweak or turn off the another alternative is to change how opening the file for in if you open the file with the cache is more likely to do the right try with and without that has spoken mostly about prefetching general caching the data even after been delivered to the is a different and obviously acts as a big win if you want to use the same data more than also in where the application has only requested a small amount of but the disk has read a whole block the os actively prefetching blocks which been but can cache the whole block so that if the app then requests more data from the same block it can return that data from the

 is directly implemented in assembly because you cannot control stack layout directly from high level note that most implementation will perform some additional optimization like aligning the stack for performance standard way of allocating stack space on x86 looks like xxx is the number of bytes to you want to look at the implementation using see and code in the first file basically aligns the desired allocation size to a 16 byte code in the 2nd file actually walks all pages which would belong to the new stack area and touches this will possibly trigger exceptions which are used by the os to grow the

 is how i resolved about everything in my runs from the click method of a button in the i have changed all those click methods to consist only of a parameterless then created a new file called entrypoint that had lots of very short friend each of which was usually one or two calls to parameterised worker so that all the click methods just called into this for a function that opens a standard document and calls a into our the function takes a parameter of which document to and there are a couple of dozen standard documents that we i have sub ctrl as byref canceldefault as handles the thisaddin and sub my new entrypoints add a new addinutilities file which interface debug class implements private addin as debug sub implements friend sub theaddin as end end go to the thisaddin file and add utilities as overrides function as if utilities is nothing utilities new end return now possible to test the function in entrypoints using something like public class appword as objmacros as public sub appword new dim addin as comaddin dim addinutilities as for each tempaddin as comaddin in if addin end addinutilities objmacros public sub public sub only thing you then unit test are the actual click because calling into entrypoints in a different ie through the requestcomaddinautomationservice interface rather than through the event it

 is no single it depends on your and the key point is ownership of the disposable resource represented by the as skeet points sometimes helpful to look at examples from the here are three examples that behave always exposes a disposable property it is considered to own the underlying and disposing the streamreader always disposes the underlying never exposes a parent it is not considered to own its so disposing the directoryentry never disposes its this case a new directoryentry instance is returned each time the parent property is and the caller is presumably expected to dispose arguably this breaks the guidelines for and perhaps there should be a method sometimes exposes a disposable connection but the caller decides if the reader owns therefore the underlying connection using the commandbehavior argument of interesting example is which has a disposable property if this property is set from then the underlying resource is assumed not to be so disposed by the if not set from a reference is generated and a flag is set to ensure it will be you can see this with lutz need to decide whether or not your container owns the and make sure you document its behavior you do decide you own the and the property is you need to make sure your setter disposes any reference somedisposableobject someobject get return set if somedisposableobject grahams rightly points out in comments that better to test for value in the setter before updated the above example to take account of this referenceequals rather than to be although in many scenarios the existence of a setter might imply that the object is not owned by the and therefore be

 is no standard that sets how variables are placed on the what happens in the compiler is much more in your the compiler may even choose to completely ignore and suppress variables and the many stages of the the code may be converted to and all stack variables lose their addresses and meanings in this form may even make it harder for the space is very in the sense that the time to allocate either 2 or 20 variables is stack space is very dynamic for most function since with the exception of a few functions nearer and with event loops or they tend to complete you just bother with

 is not possible in bases that powers of two to convert to the reason that it is possible for base 8 is that the way the conversion works is abc c if you have the lookup table of a to then the multiplication is always by 1 and some trailing so the multiplication is simple shifting consider the base of when you look at the powers of notice that the multiplication never gets so you have any lookup tables and do bitshifts and no matter how big you group it will always the best you can do is have a lookup table of the where a is the digit and b is the digit you are only reduced to adding n rather than multiplying and adding n numbers the cost of the memory of the lookup

 is not really a as the server know what fonts people are you can do it using ajax post the font to the calculate the width james curran and return the right the server may ont have the same fonts and you have to calculate padding and margins on the server can think of several options on the client every line with a a span would expand automatically to the width of the using jquery or your favorite javascript you can remove characters until the width is can do a sort of binary where at every stage you add the ellipsis and checks the wrap every line with a div and set it and add the ellipsis after the this will cut through letters and when you get a short text still show the easy use a fixed width font mostly	
 is not specific interface or but a the best example is the web itself your browser sends an http request to a web which responds with a web state transfer in this the representation is the web the state is the information contained in we could change the representation by switching to serving up xml instead of but the information would be the a restful you use this style to send data objects back and forth the state is transferred from the server to and then you send a new state back in a tomcat will already do rest for if you put your server pages as could be the resource for your to which you could use http post or put to change the details of hallmarks of rest are using uris to denote as using json or xml as the interchange medium ahah and other formats are and arguing about how to delete work out what your resources will and organise your uri system to fit it url rewriting then determine the you want to write the backend to deal with passing state representations and update the

 is on the right but a word of am sure the second command line is not needed find find is useful if you think that your file may have been but on a big that process can be extra the it find the file if it has been is on a vob with a few months or years of it will simply take too much for each element it would display the all history for versions of that without any possibility to refine that set of versions that solution simply does not and the of the command does not bring any value to the problem at it would only display the version just because of internal comments like hyperlink or hyperlink need to refine your query type of element wanted it is a date for instance would limit the date range to would cleartool find f mylogin descr would only look for files by me for a certain date which is a way to have a smaller set of versions to that i use which is only for the version not for displaying the all history of an element like your file has been run again the same command with the option would only find along with their branches and that are not visible not have a standard path in the if you specify a date with a day the whereas we are not the 28th of april it will always select 0 versions is not relevant for your but if you enter a before by that can lead to the false impression that there is no version to where there actually are versions to be

 is the underlying architectural principle of the the amazing thing about the web is the fact that clients and servers can interact in complex ways without the client knowing anything beforehand about the server and the resources it the key constraint is that the server and client must both agree on the which in the case of the web is api that adheres to the principles of does not require the client to know anything about the structure of the the server needs to provide whatever information the client needs to interact with the an is an example of the server specifies the location of the and the required browser know in advance where to submit the and it know in advance what information to both forms of information are entirely supplied by the principle is called how does this apply to and how can it be implemented in http is oriented around verbs and the two verbs in mainstream usage are get and which i think everyone will the http standard defines several others such as put and these verbs are then applied to according to the instructions provided by the imagine that we have a user database that is managed by a web our service uses a custom hypermedia based on for which we assign the mimetype might also be an and many media types may be the client and the server has both been programmed to understand this but they know anything about each as points rest api should spend almost all of its descriptive effort defining the media used for representing resources and application or in defining extended relation names for existing standard media request for the base resource might return something like know from the description of our media that we can find information about related resources from sections called this is called in this we can tell from such a section that we can find a user list by making another request for can tell a lot from this for we now know we can create a new user by posting to also know that we can change existing that we are using different http verbs delete to manipulate these and that the only knowledge we presume on the clients part is our media many much better answers on this very i explained rest to my api has hypermedia answer has been subject of a fair amount of criticism for missing the for the most that has been a fair what i originally described was more in line with how rest was usually implemented a few years ago when i first wrote rather than its true revised the answer to better represent the real

 is this because of so many most what doing here is taking the output of the perl splitting it into chunks wherever there are tabs or and taking those chunks as arguments to the first chunk which is the command to in really extremely simplistic cases like it might but just a really bad representation of what really doing cannot do quoting or use any other shell features like parameter bash but bash a temporary file to put your perl output into and then running that with bash but inconvenient as you need to create clean your temporary file and have it in a portably writable remember not to use or to execute the temporary file unless you really intend to run it all in the active when you use or you be able to reliably clean up your temporary file the best is pretty safe in the context least assuming your perl script outputs correct bash of that do pretty much the same

 it does make sense in this use cases differ here in that they cannot be used in the same use cases will be usefull to extract and formalize was workinng in a ui lab a while back and we toyed with this though we did not call it as basic idea here is that we would use agile iterative approach to development where we would use usability tesing to help converge on a desired cycle would be a few requirements and use very limited in scope very a test protocol that would allow us to gather data on this feature ease of performace or expand the application to include this a few users test the application using agile adaptation of usability testing handbook of usability where we would limit test sessions to 15 minutes with a 15 minutes usefull data from testing to inject in future method was perticularely usefull when the users would either not know exactly what they wanted or could not tell we would therefore have to devise tests that would gather objective data on the actuall usefulness of the software to the user and try to ajust the next iteration of our if i may call them so were heavily handicapped and could not talk so we had to be way of working forced us to have a gui available to the client very early in the development life and because it was the central point where we would direct testing one could say it was gui driven desing since the driving force for convergence was the user interactions with the we developped this technique mostly for very specific cases we did some testing with normal users on a normal software and got very positive the desing would converge very quickly towards the also the fact that they participated in this desing approach had also very positive effects on the acceptance of the product in the target internal strifes had the lab dismanteled before we could publish our results and expand this line of a shame uidd you pardon the bad would be a member of the tdd family of approaches towards software development where the iterations hinges around user reading on the subject

 just thought add my two cents to the i am currently developing daily in i was hired here new england about years ago as a web with little programming experience a former i was a web i knew css and html like the back of my but only some very limited in i even heard of the lasso programming language before i started they were pretty confident that pick it up as skeptical as i they were the lasso syntax is quick and easy to once you wrap your head around the syntax and the the rest falls into place in a short time i was able to build some really database web far as clearly is nowhere near the size of that of php or but what found is that developers are die hard fans of the language and thus are very active and i find a small devoted community more easily approachable and less most of the really juicy lasso conversations take place on oh i went to the lasso developers conference last year and was blown away by the dedication of the lassosoft company and the developer to mention all of the exciting stuff coming up in lasso later this downsides to first and no two ways about it if just looking to build something for demo or for a very small you might be able to get away with the lack of mature hosting take a look at the vast amount of stuff you can get in any random php hosting plan and compare that to anything you can find for pretty rough out there guys are not much to look but are pretty guess that most lasso users are hosting their own solutions you decide to keep going with here a few resources that found to be a puplic exchange for lasso custom of the worth a lasso environment for eclipse as well as a support in coda i enthusiastically mean for this to be so be happy to answer some specifics for good luck with whatever direction you choose to go

 just want the just to be able to upload or and then simple approach is just to test that the file ends in or before storing it on the this should be part of a much more validation of what the filename is allowed to contain before you let a filename anywhere near the the rules about what can go in a filename are complex on some platforms usually best to create your own filename independently with a name and any case there is no guarantee that the browser will send you a file with a usable name at and even if it does there is no guarantee that name will have or at the even if it is a text or csv platforms simply do not use extensions for file you can try to sniff the contents of the file to see what type it might this is highly for be plain or a variety of other better to give the user an explicit control to say what file type uploading use one file upload field per where it gets really say accepted the upload and stored it as and the web server is correctly serving it as the what do you think the browser interprets it plain you should be so problem is that browsers trust your and instead sniff the contents of the file to see if it looks like something serve the above snippet as plain and ie will happily treat it as this can be a huge because html can include scripts that will take over the access to the site this point you might be tempted to sniff the file on the for example using the to check it contain but this is doomed to the command does not sniff for all the same html tags as ie and other browsers sniff differently quite easy to prepare a file that will claim is not but that ie will nevertheless treat as if it is approaches such as will give you only a false sense of this is a convenience tool for loose guessing of filetypes and an effective security this point your last desperate possibilities are things all files from a separate so that a script injection attack purloin the credentials of your main all files through a cgi adding the header so that browsers attempt to display them accepting uploads from trusted	
 just wondering if it is possible to take advantage of event bubbling in non display list classes in example in the model of an application where there is a city class that contains many what methods are there to attach an event listener to a city object and receive events that bubble up from the child to clarify the city and car objects are not part of the display they are not so can bubbling be implemented outside of the display list far as i this is not possible without manually attaching event listeners to each car object and re dispatching the event from the city anyone else have a cleaner event bubbling outside of the	
 justification is you implement validation on the server side of things as otherwise abusing your code will be very easy by just disabling making it to submit any data without javascript will not solve personal experience i think most internet users hava js enabled the portion of users who may have problems with site is so unless you need to reach it probably should not be a big easiest way to determine js with just a single redirect would be to set a cookie with javascript code and then use the aforementioned to after that the server should be able to read the cookie set by assuming while quite difficult to share validation rules and other logic automatically on both server and the client using tech like i would suggest checking out aptana jaxer is a javascript based framework amongst other will allow you to share the very same javascript code on both client and very nice if you want to validate on the but want to write your validation rules

 keep it to the latest version had speed optimizations as sure everyone is using the same version of tortoisesvn which is built against the exact version of the we had many problems with guys updating on whim and then getting weird work between repositories and folders on the same so you move the binaries to another altogether and just link to them with the folders so that you can sparse checkout the project and still be able to work basically everyone checks out tops folder children only then selectively to the folders they need to checkout scripts that build then commit prompt to i have such scripts for my before i run the script and it exports my wc and then this will copy the full so this is useful with sparse checkouts where the data size is moving the binaries off of the repo recommend but it might be the sanest solution to get productivity up exporting create a which means you save disk space compared to so if you restructure such that binaries and infrequently updated items may be exported instead of it would encourage more people to the full and not try to skim some of

 key to this is examining any information you recieve and then display use in code on the form variables if they contain javascript that you store and later redisplay is a security as are any thing that gets concatenated unexamined into a sql statement you potential gotcha to watch for are attacks that mess with the character for instance if i submit a form with character set but you store and later display in latin with no translation then i might be able to sneak something past your the easiest way to handle this is to always display and store in the same character is usually a good never depend on the browser to do the right thing for you in this set explicit character sets and examine the character sets you recieve and do a translation to the expected storage set before you validate	
 keyword tells the compiler it cannot convert a value of the type into an object of your class as c explicit int i int c has a set of rules to determine what constructor is to be called in your case i know from the back of my head but you can intuitively see that the default arguments lead towards need to think those defaults can fallback onto some construction or you can use a different class is not a bad choice from a design in either you let the client code decide which constructor to c static c const const bool b true static c const bool abs const bool b true cbase bool bool bool bool cbasefrompath makes true if path is const const bool loc

 kind of simplified it a little too also comes into play when using as explained in java can only hold object so you have to box primitive values into the appropriate wrapper when you take the object out of the you get the integer that you put if you need an you must unbox the integer using the intvalue all of this boxing and unboxing is a and clutters up your the autoboxing and unboxing feature automates the eliminating the pain and the when should you use autoboxing and use them only when there is an between reference types and for when you have to put numerical values into a it is not appropriate to use autoboxing and unboxing for scientific or other numerical an integer is not a substitute for an autoboxing and unboxing blur the distinction between primitive types and reference but they do not eliminate overview of

 know of existing libraries that do everything you assuming going to need to implement xml or json based on bean properties is pretty at using apache commons beanutils to be able to get all property values in the propertyutils beanutils recursively to walk your entire object graph be careful of cycles need a set or something on the side to keep track of what already look at xmlencoder it works using javabean properties to create one approach might be to use existing libs json or to create objects then deal with merging the properties between the xmldecoder class can read bean xml you create it using the tricky part to this approach is to know when a value has been to null vs just not been set in the this approach also has the extra overhead of creating a bunch of new reading json or xml is a little but not too assume you already have some means of indexing the objects you want to merge into a map of some assume you already have some means to know which property is the key that uniquely identifies an object assume last name is just to get the point as it would make a bad for this type of recommend a sax reader for the xml need a stack to keep track of which objects adding data the sax reader tells you what tags are seen and then gives the values for those you could also use xml pull which tends to be a little take a look at some of the open source json libraries and do some json is pretty simple to and these tools tend to be pretty small so this be a big you could write an antlr other parser to read the json and do with it as you

 learning any sort of hdl it is important to keep thing in it is software programming and things work in that being i find that the best way to learn any hdl is to learn how to think in hardware and describe the hardware why it is called a hardware description i have rarely seen books that show you how your hdl gets translated into read through one when i was at synopsys filled with code and but it was an internal even lacking this you can still see how your code gets turned into hardware by running it through synthesis on reason that i wish to stress this is because there are many ways to solve a you will only be able to write code that solves it from a gate count and timing stand if you understand how it gets translated into underlying

 learning ruby in my spare and i have a question about language constructs for does ruby have an equivalent of the const keyword to keep variables from being some example like to declare to be because i use it below in my program and i really want to modify it by does ruby provide a language construct for doing or should i just suck it up and realize that my variables are always to most likely cause of overwriting of variables long blocks of i agree with the spirit of your but disagree with the your point about avoiding long blocks of code and unnecessary state is a good but for constants can also be useful in describing the design of code inside of the a large part of the value of const in my code comes from annotating which variables i should change and which i so that not tempted to change them if i come back to my code next this is the same sentiment that suggests that code that uses short comments because of good variable names and clear indentation is better than awkwardly written code explained by detailed option appears to be which i like the look of as thanks for the responses equivalent of

 lisp applications from command lisp implementations support a or mechanism that will encapsulate a body of code and run functions at as another poster these mechanisms are and lisp implementations have a so a conventional approach to deploying a lisp application is to wrap a shell script around the script must set up the program environment and pass command line typically the runtime context includes application files to load asd or and one or more forms to evaluate or functions to extending can roll your own or you can some existing take a look at which is useful for several below for more about clbuild functionality and can extend clbuild to run your own application with command line for to load the system and run the function you would invoke clbuild as run any 1 2 the character escape syntax for this is needed for most command alternative approach is to redirect standard input from a for run any functionality and is most commonly used to install and run open source commonlisp is a bash so it is highly the download facility relies on programs like and default clbuild runs sbcl but it is very easy to configure it to run another lisp such as cl copy to and edit to point to the lisp executable you want to

 lists are often implemented using arrays which makes them very fast and by their nature do not require dynamic you just need a quick check on the read and the write indexes to see if they fell off the end and if reset it to zero they are generally used for things like input where the data has no real value once contact lists have lasting value and new contacts will overwrite older contacts once the list fills which might be ok unless you overwrite your grandmom who is leaving you a bunch of cash in her do not think that a linked list is the most efficient way to go for a circular buffer original purpose of a circular buffer is speed and an array simply cannot be beaten for speed in the context of a circular even if you keep a pointer to your last accessed linked list an array will still be more lists have dynamic resizing capabilities that are unneeded for circular said i think a circular buffer is probably not the right structure for the application you

 loading up to 250 megabytes of data into client memory seems not to be such an good if you have it you can use linq to object and save the database problem is that your data is hierarchical and you have to fetch one examin and retrieve the releated rows and this causes so many could use lazy loading to retrieve more and more rows into client memory during the runtime of your program and perform more and more queries in memory when the working set but this will only help if rows are accessed multiple times and not only once or solution might be to create recursive views or stored procedure using common table expression that retrieve releate rows up to some distance from a given

 looking through the standard there is nothing provided by or any of the class templates to allow you to extract the underlying os file descriptor the way that does for c stdio is there an method or constructor that takes such a file descriptor as a parameter would allow you to open the file using a different mechanism and record the is however i suspect that this does not in fact call i expect like in it only makes sure that the runtime library buffers are meaning that the os could still be buffering the in short there appears to be no way to do this to my suggestion is to subclass typename traits public int use you can construct an using the default then assign the new buffer with to fd course you could also derive a new class from to make the process of opening a file and retrieving its file descriptor more

 looks like gae has chosen a subset of jdk as app engine jdk white is very unfortunate as one gets class linkage errors all over the place with most common java libraries that deal with data class loading and although some omissions may be for deprecated or legacy there are others that are my specific concern is with streaming pull parsers which was just added to jdk after a long delay was finalized at about same time as jdk omitting this makes it harder to do scalable xml as i understand is that not only are classes but they can not even be added because of security this is an philosophical question that probably just gae devs could answer for sure why are some apis dropped from standard jdk seemingly thanks for for what worth i really do not see how security would have anything to do with not including aspects are relevant for great many other things i need for and can see why they are so understandable boilerplate just not applicable for this api is just a set of interfaces and abstract for crying out but more it has exactly the same ramifications as including dom and jaxp interfaces which are included it looks like this issue has been brought to attention of google on whitelisting stax hoping that this and similar issues can be resolved behind google app engine excluding standard jdk

 might be missing something but i will take a crack at this you have to create the control hierarchy the same as it was on the inital rendering for you ids to match and allow your events to fire it sounds like you need to do some reordering after an event fires so you will need to create the controls need to be able to recreate your controls and the control hierarchy on post you should send enough information to the client so that you can recreate the controls correctly on this can be done by saving information in viewstate if should only recompute the control inforation when it is in your case because of some post back basic flow should be like in you load if you have the viewstate needed to create your call your populate otherwise create them from when a post back the load event will create but they are being reconstructed from viewstate so this should be when the post back event call you populate method to recreate the controls in the new order or with the new depending on what event i am building a control i like to think about how the control will behave if a post back occurs from some other control on the your control should continue to look the same unless affected by that post back and it should be able to be recreated without doing any data but from information it has collected on previous edited my answer and hopefully this is a littler clearer

 more details from prefix enables the use keywords as which useful when interfacing with programming the character is not actually part of so the identifier might seen in other languages as a without the identifier with an prefix is a verbatim use of the prefix for identifiers that are keywords is but discouraged as a matter of language with therefore allows to derive from a class named which might be defined in a library written in another language than any other case i would not recommend to use this syntax and rather make up identifiers different from the keywords valu instead of to increase code readability and avoid confusion whether there is any special meaning attached to is also another interesting fact about variable naming mentioned containing two underscore characters reserved for use by for implementation might provide keywords that begin with

 more like you want to use powershell you can spawn new windows other by using see also although you probably have to use some other tools and a little trickery to create something like a have only a maximum of instances running at a you could achieve the latter by using and counting how many are already there loop or if and simply wait 2 and again whether you can spawn a new have cobbled together a little test batch for in do call lss 5 rem just a dummy program that waits instead of doing useful rem but suffices for echo starting processing instance for start 5 goto wait a can be adjusted with 2 because the first ping returns otherwise just use an address unused and waiting for instances to close 2 jump back to see whether we can spawn a new process this could probably be done but instances should contain the number of running instances in csv eq do set spawns a maximum of four new processes that execute in parallel and wait time needs to be adjusted depending on how much each process does and how long it is you probably also need to adjust the process name for which tasklist is looking if doing something is no way to properly count the processes that are spawned by this one way would be to create a random number at the start of the batch and create a helper batch that does the processing spawns the processing but which can set its window title to a would be a simple batch that sets its title to the first parameter and then runs the second parameter with the third as you can then filter in tasklist by selecting only processes with the specified window title eq this should work fairly reliable and prevents too many false searching for would be a bad idea if you still have some instances as that limits your pool of worker can use to create a sensible default of how many instances to can also easily adapt this to use to spawn the processes remotely be very viable as you have to have admin privileges on the other machine as well as provide the password in the you would have to use process names for filtering

 most common solution is to have an activity you can assume that an active user will make at least one request within amount of time say 5 minutes or can enforce this by putting an async request triggered off a timer that starts when the page for if assuming that all active users will make at least 1 request every then each page will request an empty page every that as long as they have the browser window always have activity from that this is handled by asynchronous not by any sort of reload this makes it absolutely transparent to the an added see if you can make that ajax request pull down some useful rather than just enforcing licensing

 my experience with linq to i have concluded for a few reasons that linq is using reflection to set and get field values in entity class i know if i can remember all the but what i can tell i recall linq does not call any property but directly sets and reads all the private field values which can only be done via as far as i names provided by the metadata the attributes on the entity class provide field name information in string form the database column and property name are for you can conclude from this that linq must be using reflection to look up the member to access think it does this to enforce simplicity you can rely on the values in the fields in the entity class directly mirroring the database column and not much overhead in retrieving the object from the database a newly created entity to correspond to values retrieved from the database should not be routed through property one thing i have done to represent enumerated values retrieved from the for is to make some of the properties private and wrap them in a manually coded property in a partial class that reads and writes the linq

 need to design an application that resembles an internal mailing this is just a course no networking the professor is just making us put the discussed data structures to i have been having trouble deciding how to design the let me explain briefly what i have to do and then i will share my think it would be a good idea if let you know that this is a command line based no gui internal mail system consists of 5 different possible and it is possible to be only at one state at a when the application it enters the general state by the only possible command in this state is to log in to some other account the user has basic commands like reading his sending new ones to some other deleting logging and a couple a user can change to one of two compose or to get to the compose the user must use the command in this state you compose a message to some other once you finish composing the message you go back to the user the only way a user could go back to general is by logging inherits the behavior of and mod are pretty much the they can change states as a summary of how it is possible to change a new to design been reading a lot about them this will be the first time implement if one of my suggestions seem weird please let me state pattern seems like a great i lets me change an object state not all states have the same administrators has more methods than moderator does not have any of the methods from admin or you can only use general to log i think that this will then limit the ability to use state do you have any suggestions for some other idea i had was something like the since i can ascend and descend i could be seen as a for a user that is in compose compose top user general you have any ideas on how i could implement is it even although comfortable with java the or pseudo code is a design

 need to find an algorithm for generating every possible permutation of a binary and need to do so without using lists is because the tree itself carries semantics and restraints that cannot be translated into found an algorithm that works for trees with the height of three or but whenever i get to greater i loose one set of possible permutations per height node carries information about its original so that one node can determine if all possible permutations have been tried for that the node carries information on weather or not been if it has seen all possible permutations of the tree is meaning that the right node should always in some cases that i need to cover for this be a leaf while the left node is always either a leaf or a algorithm using at the moment can be described sort of like the left child node has been swap my right node with the left child nodes right set the left child node as if the current node is back to its original swap my right node with the lowest left right swap the lowest left nodes two set my left node as set my left chilnode to use this as original set this node as return return if the left child has not been if the result of trying to permute left child is return the permutation of this else return the permutation of the left child this node has a left node and a right node that are both swap set this node to be desired behaviour of the algoritm would be something like branch branch 0 branch branch 2 1 0 first branch branch 1 second 2 branch branch 1 0 2 third branch branch 0 fourth swap 1 2 so a binary tree without the use of

 need to poll a web service in some time intervals and just return whatever seems appropriate to your application the messages you and update the progress the process is first step is to actually initiate the operation that must run and second step is to constantly poll the server to see if the operation is you would have to somehow store the current operation status on the i know which technology working so i can only tell you to use something that your framework of choice but make sure the process state is set in a variable that can be persisted is in example in a session synchronizing this value between the running process and the polling method may be such splash screens are rather used in desktop applications or in web applications when the processing is performed on the i think a good idea to try to have an updating progress when the method running asynchronously resides on the a progress indicator like this would be good when loading assets images or other and you can count the currently loaded the total size and so no matter whether the processing operation will be invoked on the server or on the client it must be you want yet another dull indicator in your web you may randomly display some funny quotes or other texts from an solution minimize the time it takes to process the

 nfs you face some problems with client side caching and stale i have written an os independent lock module to work over nfs the simple idea of creating a file does not work well over the basic idea to work around it is to create a lock file which if present means file is not locked and a process that wants to acquire a lock renames the file to a different name like the rename is an atomic enough operation that works well enough over nfs to guarantee exclusivity of the the rest is basically a bunch of fail error checking and lock retrieval in case the process dies before releasing the lock and renaming the lock file back to

 nice thing about wordpress is that you can go a few different routes trying to accomplish route worked well for me is to list each business as a post and then create categories and to house these once this is you can create custom templates for either category templates if your have a category named and it has the category id of you can create a template named and then wordpress will know to look to that template first and then move on to the regular file and so your category template you can then list out each sub category a function like and call out the children categories from other option is to still go the route of entering in your businesses as a separate filing them under the appropriate but instead of creating a category you can create a page need to do a few things for your template file the necessary template syntax to tell wordpress to look for that as a template file such food a page in wordpress using this new your page template create a new pointing to this such new if while and do other stuff here are other options you can do as and for i would hang out some wordpress user groups to see if you can grab some other

 not a heard this kind of question before and it stems from a confusion with reference where circular referencing does pose a collector count it just scans and flags referenced those flags also prevent it from going into a this is a very simple and virtually foolproof the system need to count or track inbound so there is zero overhead for shortlived but you have to keep an eye on where references a common problem are objects that subscribe to the event keeps a so you need to unsubscribe before the subscribing object can be another benefit of gc is that the logic also works in whenever your code has access to a reference that reference is guaranteed to be simply because that reference counting requires the compiler to inject code every time a reference is copied or goes out of incurring a constant when the count drops to zero the object can be immediately the system needs a mechanism to handle you can find some horror stories by searching for the com iunknown

 not much obviously better than marching through the string a character at a time and making sure the user entered only ones and keep in mind that even though you could write a fast assembly routine if you everything is or you really want to do the user could enter and like to be able to tell them if they screwed up or true that this seems slow compared to the couple cycles it probably takes to add the actual but does it really matter if you get your answer in a nanosecond or a humans can only detect 30 milliseconds of latency it already takes far longer to get input from the user and write output to the screen than it does to parse the string or add the so your algorithm is hardly the bottleneck save your fancy optimizations for things that are actually computationally intensive you should focus on here is making the task less it turns out someone already did that for a look at char char int will let you convert a string in any base to a it checks sample usage for converting a binary number bad try else number is now a long converted from a valid binary base 2 tells to convert binary

 not sure i entirely agree with your assumption that you cannot restore the database after a test while i definitely agree that some tests should be run on a i see why you run most of your tests on a much smaller test are there constraints that need to be tested like be more than a billion identical recommendation would actually be to use a smaller test database for most of your functional and to all of its tables with each with as little sample data as is necessary to test your

 not sure if an answer for this already as i figure out what mechanism in linq is meant for this or if i just need to do it say i have 2 name employeeid skill each employee can have 0 or more goal is to draw this information into a data structure in one sql class int string employees my table relations are i could just foreach the employees table employee in select however when i access the employeeskills it is going to execute a seperate query for every employee record since that data returned with the first and i what i want done so far as sql is is run a query with a left from employees left join employeeskills on will get me my but need to manually collate it into my list since an employee with 2 skills will return 2 there a linq operation that does example employee in new employeeid name skills new from employeeskill in select to retrieving nested data structures with one

 not sure who advised against the use of xml for persistence in your but it would seem to me that given the potential total size of your persisted xml is perfect for you because of its simple integration into sounds to me like only talking about 100 records with a maximum of 10 fields on a single that could easily be preprocessed from xml persisted data and dealt with in i do agree with nocarrier about potentially using linq to looking for simplicity and your users sound like they could do without the 3rd party

 not sure you can do i think texture coordinate modes only apply for the entire when using an using so that your texture coordinates never come close to 0 and the normal limits where wrapping and clamping might be extensions to deal with i to repeat a draw a polygon that is than your texture for if you had a square texture that you wanted to repeat a number of times over a bigger draw a rectangle six times as wide as it is then set the texture coordinates to and the texture mode to when interpolating across the the texture coordinate that goes beyond 1 due to repeat being in the causing the texture to be mapped six times across the is a bit crude to explain without when texturing using just a part of the no way to specify that larger texture coordinate in a way that makes opengl repeat it inside only the

 not the end of the world if i miss a i just wish something would generate at least a warning for problem here is that you always deal with an idisposable by just wrapping it up in a sometimes you need the object to hang around for a bit in which case you will have to call its method explicitly good example of this is where a uses a private eventwaithandle an to communicate between two threads and you want to dispose of the waithandle once the thread is it as simple as some tool just checking that you only create idisposable objects within a

 not too familiar with but could this be the difference between soap and betting that you can specify either is there a compelling reason to not just use the wcf	
 not too sure i completely understand your do you want to have all the pools using the same but just differing by a distinguishing or do you want separate pools of tables within the one with a suffix on each table to distinguish the way you should have multiple databases for two major the first being if you have to change the schema on one it affect the if your load goes up for any other you may want to move the pools onto separate physical machines with new database security access to a database server can be more tightly locked of these things can still be accomplished without requiring separate databases but the separation will make all of this easier and reduce the complexity of having to mentally track which tables you want to operate

 not valid and is not valid xml is not valid xml because the and are not valid characters inside attribute they need to be escaped using the corresponding xml entities and is not valid html either because the short closing form is not allowed in html is correct in xml and the tag is also an implicitly closed tag as per the html this means that manually closing it is actually and is equivalent to closing any other tag correct version in html the correct version in xhtml and xml following example you gave is also is not valid html or xml the name of the tag must be right behind the although the attributes and the closing may be wherever they so the valid xml is another funkier you can actually choose to use either or as your attribute quoting is single quoted and the other reasons that were posted are but the biggest problem with parsing html is that people usually understand all the syntax rules the fact that your browser interprets your tagsoup as html means that you have actually written valid and even agrees with me regarding the definition of valid and your invalid is not while my corrected version xml is not made to be parsed with but there is also no reason to do there are many xml parsers for each and every you have the choice between sax dom parsers and pull all of these are guaranteed to be much faster than parsing with a regexp and you may then use cool technologies like xpath or xslt on the resulting dom reply is not only is parsing xml with regexps but it is also a bad just use one of the millions of existing xml and take advantage of all the advanced features of is just too hard to even try parsing on your first the legal syntax has many little subtleties that you may not be aware and html in the wild is just a huge stinking pile of get my there are a variety of lax parser libraries that do a good job at handling html like tag just use	
 not very serious a can be implemented without things are pretty of and not a lot of fun to work but they can be implemented with very little and would give you a chance to fool around with various schemes for maintaining the file state in memory pretty they would put you in touch with the programmers of the early seventies they had teletypes and the first glass but after punched cards were a bit

 now completed my first web application using mvc and i still am not grasping why this is getting all the praise and maybe being i know that what makes mvc great is that is forces separation between the presentation layer and the business object or data layer along with its stateless i also know that when you are working with the it appears that the code is less readable my example i guess my question if the separation is the why not just forms view forms code code controller new pagetext pagetitle i might be being but one of the things that i really liked in webforms is the ease in setting object properties like datasources and text it seems like this is completely different in mvc and less readable which makes me wonder about long term looking into the typed i think the readability of the code is substantially mvc

 objects should be reasonably dumb with respect to the you should implement some sort of access layer object or data that knows how to persist your business objects to the database and keep the connection logic there rather than putting the code in each of your business your repository or context would be disposable so that it could clean up after suggestion that you follow the unit of work pattern is a good might want to look at to either use them or at least for ideas on how to structure a good data layer if you insist on writing your from personal experience i can tell you that using an existing technology is much easier than writing and maintaining your	
 observe a phenomenon that looks like religion to only in a development here is an example are three people working on a small the project will involve a public web service that will serve requests by fetching data from a and also a separate component that would fill and update this all three of us care a lot to make this project but we come from different one of us has only done java development enterprise java while two of us have only done choosing what to develop the project as you may each one stood his ground and insisted we use the technology he knows other than we are good and we are determined to work not a but think that two of us being more productive is a good argument to use the java guy on the other hand is also an and thinks that using free tools would be decisive for the started with a using for development and a mysql which appeared to be a huge not because we make it but because of all the overhead to make the two it would have been a snap if we used with sql server or php and mysql those pairs are just made to work with each real problem in this case is that whatever we at least one is going to make a compromise and not be and of the whole which is not how do we work this how do we work out religious differences between i know that every good programmer have a problem working with a foreign but i need such what if any of us converting is not an out religious differences between developers in a team

 of deciding if the user is authenticated in the you can do it in the like actionresult return return you can redirect to a login page rather than having this logic in a which is not really a separation of really cool way of doing this is to use a different master page for authenticated users than for not authenticated i take it you are wanting to always show either a log or log off this way you could use an actionfilter to change the master page depending on the authentication of the then your logged on users can get things like navigation bars that you would maybe want to hide from without you having to decide this in display one way of doing it without using an action but you can do all kinds of one good one is to create a custom controller that inherits from controller and overrides the view methods to select the appropriate master actionresult return return this

 of good recommendations above that would work in most in my i ultimately wanted to load strings from a and keep the string resources as close to as i so i rolled my after looking at some of the implementations above for the resulting implementation was quite short and is a class which in my case derives from but it could derive from about any string there is also a class stringarg job is to take any parameter type and turn it into a string it mimics tostring in if a new object needs to be you just add another the constructor allows a format specifier for string class then accepts a string table id for the source a number of stringarg and finally an optional hinstance use lots of any of which could host the string so this allowed me to pass it or use a hinstance by to it it only takes a string id for an but it would be trivial to add an input string instead of a string s you are years old in for the stringarg class which does the equivalent of tostring on lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec cstring cstring hinstance dll implements this for getting own hinstance scenarios with a single resource dll need the string there are a bunch of member functions and constructors that take up to 10 these ultimately call centralformat which does the real string public hinstance hinst const hinstance hinst const const hinstance hinst const const const hinstance hinst const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const const const hinstance hinst hinstance hinst const hinstance hinst const const hinstance hinst const const const hinstance hinst const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const const const hinstance hinst void hinstance the implementation ok to post this much on although the bulk of it is very lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec return hinstance argscount below assumes a single character position cstring hinstance hold bool b string or more likely a bad stringid was used tell cstring could not be hinst ghcommonhinst was passed was not passed error inform for the degenerate lpcwstr pstr bool bskip this an incoming string only support 10 so the next char must be a closing bskip is a index positional cstring pstr past the two extra characters that we skipped ahead and peeked hinstance return const hinstance return const const hinstance return const const const hinstance return const const const const hinstance return const const const const const hinstance return const const const const const const hinstance return const const const const const const const hinstance return const const const const const const const const hinstance return const const const const const const const const const hinstance return

 on what you define by if you allow operators of alternative and the time can actually be where is size of a regex and is length of the you do it by constructing a nfa is linear in and then simulating it by maintaining the set of states in and updating that for every letter of that make regex parsing and capturing is still ok with the aforementioned although it would get the complexity so it might be backreferences raise the recognition power of the and its difficulty is is just another name for which raises the complexity of the aforementioned algorithm to a disaster for constructing the automaton possibly but should still be possible to tackle with the dynamic algorithm in something like that with a concrete things might get better or as a rule of simple features should be fast and unambiguous not like regexes are	
 on wikipedia lists different methods for doing multiplication in a digital i worked on a project to add simd instructions to an dec processor in verilog back in we implemented a tree the primary reason being it ran in a fixed number of cycles and was easy to you mentioned using the other bit fiddling on modern processors multiplication would not be microcoded like be way to slow and the processor would get slaughtered in

 on your some languages allow you to keep state in the for n as as static flag as integer flag return n allowed this as i suspect looking for a different solution idea is that since they define the result of the first call to the function you could use to control whether to invert the int sign if return return one to the magnitude of all even subtract one from the magnitude of all odd the result of two calls has the same but the one call where even we swap the there are some cases where this work max or min but it works a lot better than anything else suggested so

 once ran across a commercial tool for windows that allowed you to code changes outside of source control but now i remember the name of it would copy the current version of a document to a backup location and undo your checkout in source you could then reintroduce your backed up changes i believe it worked with multiple source control does anyone know what program trying to purpose of my asking is the first is to find a good way to do the second is because i just remember what that darn program was and driving me of any

 one more and someone else has already optimized this problem for until actually measured your code and traced a performance problem to this part of you have no reason not to do the straightforward you are worried about then abstract the problem make a class to wrap whatever lookup mechanism you end up using and write your code to use this you can change the implementation later if you find you need some other data structure for greater up on hash are and if you are worried about their time or space you should read up on how this is basic computer the short of it is that hash tables case lookup space about depending on various do not know where you read that they were but if they then they would not be in practical use as they are in most languages there are two advantages to these nice properties of hash lookup time implies that you will not pay a cost in lookup time for having a larger as lookup time depend on space implies that you gain much of anything from breaking your dictionary up into smaller space scales linearly with number of so lots of small dictionaries will not take up significantly less space than one large one or vice this would not be true if they were but lucky for are some more resources that might article on hash gives a great listing of the various lookup and allocation schemes used in scheme has a nice discussion of how much space you can expect hashtables to take including a formal discussion of why amount of space used by the hash table is proportional to the number of associations in the this might interest are some things you might consider if you find you actually need to optimize your dictionary is the c source code for in case you want all the copious documentation in is a of in case you like reading to hashtable class talk a bit about how load factors and how they affect the space your hash takes note a tradeoff between your load factor and how frequently you need to rehashes can be

 one other interesting thing related to this value of syncroot on collections brad notice a syncroot property many of the collections in think this property was a krzysztof a program manger my just sent me some on why that is i agree with found the synchronization apis to insufficiently flexible for the apis allow for safe access to a single member of the problem is that are numerous scenarios where you to lock on multiple operations example remove one item and in other the code that uses a collection wants to choose can the right not the collection found that syncroot is actually very rarely and in cases where it it actually does not add in cases where not it is just an annoyance implementers of assured we will not make the mistake as we build the versions of these

 one very simple and good way to avoid such considerations completely you can consider returning a to the created object it will be practically the same when it comes to usability but your object will surely not be copied unnecessarily and it will be true also if you return it though a couple layers of function

 only be but to at and this is normally used for things like inserting database performance logging statements you can drop the calls from the source code and make it a lot access control you separate the implementation and there are a lot of extremely useful things you can do if you can quietly wrap one class with that also means trivial to wrap your classes to capture all of the unencrypted messages within your encryption i think i can get in even if you do everything in a single long although it might take a little more

 only recently started with but basically interested in these i write any code if i learn i use windows mostly at work and linux at most of my friends use windows either predominantly or i know people with i would like the option of writing code for all of after trying a number of operating systems and operating system formed the opinion that the free stuff is of a higher also i find it more morally so i want to be restricted my library to writing proprietary after trying a number of operating systems and operating system formed the opinion that a real quality product forms more readily with strong commercial red novell and canonical make flavours of linux that appeal strongly to me and what do you commercial windows and mac os x are commercial operating and good enough for most this only serves to emphasize my simple build i come from a scripting and accustomed to having my changes applied the moment i hit save in a text editor not having to so having a very quick and simple build process is important to if i can use the same build procedure on multiple platforms by flicking a switch on a i feel like strayed too far from the scripting other look at me i know all the silly compsci 102 the first language i was really comfortable with is php is quite the powerful object oriented but most of the examples most of the completely ignores any object oriented believe me when i all the facilities for that kind of programming exist in php just that unless taught it you will learn all the things first like i i want to be able to participate in and i mind having to work to figure out how to apply it in if i get to choose which paradigm i subscribe even does qt stack easier to learn than pure you need to learn both to use it i had to do platform detection even i will have to when i finish my current project because there will be an option to wake up the display and linux test on a when certain events occur in the but arguably pretty low you can write a text web browser or game without needing a feature like my qmake project files are portable to all platforms without special software without requiring cygwin or although if i wanted to switch to msvc there would be no qt allows me to release my work under the gnu gpl if i and this makes me qt is backed by everyone knows i own a fairly expensive nokia with a bunch of qt apps on furthermore other companies like red hat et al submit the odd patch now and you get much more commercial than qmake how hard is it works on it works on it even works on i have to define anything or rewrite any project files or idiotproof and it never goes although i break free of object oriented programming when i use i can stray pretty far from it before the application falls and when i oop in qt is always waiting with open arms to welcome me i mind having to use objects of various kinds for no matter what mood in it feels pretty natural under as a never tried another library and i probably never i can get everything i need from qt at this even json and soap and file locking and quite capable of writing c code and i like plain c a looking into learning about doing not because of any dissatisfaction with after a bit of soul searching qt seemed like the obvious choice chose the not the language and then started writing it in its native i want to learn gtk because so many free software projects interested in use and interested in having the knowledge to contribute to some very interesting projects include browsers and instant messengers networking code is something pretty well familiar with of php even if it is in totally the wrong language so when some protocol problem happens in a software product i know what it is gone way off track now retaining the the point is that qt has everything i was looking for in a including portability and a shallow learning performance as good as doing native api function calls apparently but i still very quick compared to most scripting languages is more than fast enough if you write good code and even sometimes if you and still faster than many programming rather finish the application in one year and have it take an hour to than take ten years to write the same program to do that same job in 45 minutes the slower version is a stepping but bear in mind comparing the abstracted model to the bare api more information about how using a library can make an application more stable and more fun to look for me personally the questions is not switch to but move away from and there is absolutely no reason to do so at hooked for only be working with other systems if i happen to be hacking someone not used mfc i possibly tell you that moving to qt is the right thing to but i tell try see whether difficult to learn to use see if it hurts your work in any if you i bet you would win

 only way to really use entities end to end is to use something a little bit more sophisticated than in my experience going to have to manage the hibernate session manually at the application opensessioninview will only give you the same session for one after that need to be constantly reattaching to the current take a look at seam and or implement your own hibernate session we currently manually manage our sessions based on when a wizard starts and ends and use spring aop to attach sessions to the right threads just in are not thread not a good mix with on the other hand most certainly are going to need some form of i see a way around entities may look like pojos but serializing them can range from difficult to nearly just create dtos that fit with the goal of the service method and be done with i think the dto pattern is if just making a website feasible to go end to end with entities and it may even buy you some performance but if like a more flexible stick with

 operators are like a little can make something too much can make it	
 operators are potentially excellent ways to do certain but are horribly easy to the and operators makes it easy to extend both in new kinds of new objects for and overloading makes smart pointers almost a replacement for overloaded operators make it possible to have a string concatenation and to build up new sorts of numbers that are syntactically just like having them makes it possible to do things in libraries that would require changes in other do have their there is no operator suitable for there is only one multiplication and in some cases more than one way to multiply 3d for at least the dot and cross the and comma operators cannot replicate their since they have evaluations and sequence of they can be no language for that arithmetic operators have to work anything like seen horrible things done in an effort to come up with a sql notation that somebody thought was in a program that was badly impossible to know x since or maybe or and the operator functions could be written to do intention in designing was to include useful features regardless of the possibility of whereas james intention in designing java was to exclude excessively abusable features even if they were somewhat not clear to me that either of those philosophies is correct or but they are was designed to avoid situations that would usually call for some like operator multiple and type so they often whether this is good or bad or neither is not something i far as teaching tell them not to overload operators themselves under defined such as functors and the assignment but point out how the library uses overloaded i trust any student to do them and if going to be able to do it they can and will learn it on their they will know because you forbade it in some of the ones i would never trust with anything more complicated than a statement will find out how to overload and will do but

 option would be to post the work onto a queue of some sort could use something enterprisey like with or as a connector or you could use something lightweight like which is written in scala and speaks the same protocl as memcache so you can just use the python memcache client to talk to you have the queueing mechanism set you can create as many or as few worker tasks that are subscribed to the queue and do the actual downloading work as you you can even have them live on other machines so they interfere with the speed of serving yourwebsite at when the workers are they post the results back to the database or another queue where the webserver can pick them you want to have to manage external worker processes then you could make the workers threads in the same python process that is running the but then obviously it will have greater potential to impact your web page serving

 order to run a program a bash or binary you need to have execute when you enter a the first word as in the specifies the command to and that is started up as a separate in the case of a shell it executes a new copy of the shell interpreter listed on the and runs the program using that ls 1 lambda lambda 23 mar 25 chmod 744 foo or chmod ls 1 lambda lambda 23 mar 25 you use the that is a shell builtin command that says to source the file into the current that means that it executes the commands in the file as if you had run them from the command right in the current you need only read permission to source a for if you set a variable in a it change the value in the current but if you source a bash script into the current then it does change the cat setvariables echo echo shell function in your is a lot like a but it acts like a command in the current when you source your using that defines that function in the current and it can execute like any other shell function you have far as the permissions are i would bet that before changing the permissions to 100 means only not which is fairly useless for a file since you need to be able to read it and execute it to do you had already sourced the file into your current that would mean that the function was already and it matter the permissions of the file after once the function is defined in the current you can even delete the and as long as that shell is still the function will still be as i see from your edited once you unset the you get an that indicates strongly to me that my hypothesis was and that you had already sourced the file before you changed as i sourcing and executing the file are entirely different and once you source a its permissions matter at the function has already been loaded into the currently running you can tell by running your original experiment after doing the if you you have read and then the function be

 our used scaleout stateserver commercial product to accomplish distributed caching replication of objects throughout a server farm for similar this has been quite although using objects does incur so in many cases we simplify what storing to just string values where fully evaluated the velocity since our usage started before that existed and we have time or compelling reasons to consider a switch at this but that obviously warrants some investigation if just starting i did indeed miss the important part about the question the flattening of object this may be things or have other but what if you took the approach of more closely simulating database storage in your distributed cache it to storing a single copy of each distinct object and using looser references to link those entities you have a which has a property and all containing objects that are instances of your have to use custom serialization to pull it and nothing will magically solve concurrency dirty update but the idea is that what put into the distributed cache would actually be all individual as well as a shallow copy of the instance that shallow copy would serialize the normal properties as well as unique identifiers for each reference contained within the original database a unique or whatever is rather than the person objects so have a instead of the and the members collection would serialize as a list of each person referenced is also stored as a separate where the concurrency trickiness comes into deserializing on depending on usage the group shallow copy would follow all person id references and those references with the real person objects stored separately in the distributed need to implement locking mechanisms to make sure updates to those which could be shared among many different were also need a versioning mechanism and a whenever necessary to up any changes to the person object made within the distributed does seem quite but the most generic approach i could think of without knowing the specifics of your use

 personally hope to drop support for ie6 soon as a may end up being longer than i but for sure no new development will be supporting actually curious to see where libs like jquery previously they said they support the latest official build and the previous one for a major browser it was ie7 and i wonder if the next version of jquery will dump it would be a brave but certainly make for a tighter library in the

 pointers are a poor attempt to be you could even make an argument that having function pointers makes a language since you can write higher order functions with closures and easy sorta so you tend to use them far less than mainly for oo design works around using functions by instead creating a whole interface type to pass in the function has so function pointers actually store an object so not just a raw but typed state are vastly more usable of the comments said there should be a demonstration of higher order functions with function any function taking a callback function is a higher order wndenumproc lparam parameter is the function to pass easy but since there are no closures in we get this lovely second an value to be passed to the callback that value allows you to manually pass around untyped state to compensate for lack of framework is also filled with similar for a object that qualifies or contains information about an asynchronous since the iar is all you get on your without you need a way to shove some data into the async op so you can cast it out	
 pontus makes good the problem is that the presentation is actually the structure of the so there really a choice if you want to add new own application is quite rigid in this functionality is added through creating new command object that manipulate the you need to use the objects developed by using the memento pattern to save the initial state and then save the changed state so that is properly you have to put the command object in one of the event handling structures in the view that was developed using passive of course the choice of supporting object and functions within the command object our developers have a fair amount of you are talking about new applications that are made by a company then there is often a good reason while the various patterns are in our company we have to maintain our application over decades so design adaptability is very we use the flavor of the month in development as it will come back and haunt us 15 years so many of our application are designed using passive view and multiple layers connecting through well defined this served as well when ms decided to axe vb6 in favor of sometimes is just the manager following the flavor of the in this case you need to try to educate the manager as to why your proposed method will work out better for the company in the long otherwise then you need educate yourself as to why the company chose the standards it	
 porting a sdk from windows to mac osx i have a problem in xcode where my breakpoints in certain files will only be hit if i set them while if i stop debugging and then the breakpoints no longer get if i add them while not they get this is only in certain files and my breakpoints are always dark i tell the difference between a breakpoint that will get hit and one that my sdk is made up of various dynamic these are built using perforce which calls the various compile and link executables depending on my os and compiler version as visual and i have a simple command line application that links to these dynamic libraries and calls code in this application on windows is a visual studio in which i set breakpoints on library code and expect them to be created the same command line utility application in xcode that links to the sdk dylibs and calls code in some of the breakpoints work i can set breakpoints in code called from the troublesome and step out to the troublesome which i can then step through the troublesome code is compiled into the same dylib as code that works also long and complicated enough not to be a candidate for tried the load symbols lazily with both gcc and gcc a full clean and the files of the xcodeproj the files so they clash with system everything out of the breakpoints a new xcode application is compiled in debug with dwarf format and my libraries are built with the flag with i386 and would be much sorry for not updating my mac port project was i never resolved but discovered that it actually only occurs in constructor revisit this as and when i hit the problem breakpoints only hit when set during

 position elements are typically a bit of a warning sign for by taking things out of the document flow you are losing one of the main benefits of which is by mixing px and em measurements you are creating a slightly stylesheet jam that allow for the page to be resized the central problem seems to be a question of whether you are barking up the right tree in terms of approach and do you to be using the maintainpositiononscrollback option from it be too hard to implement a bit of light javascript to create an equivalent effect on an overflowed if you are stuck with the do you to have your text in a small box like that or could you just let the page be as long as the you to use the maintainpositionscrollback and you to have the content in a small box you might be better off using some less code for your perhaps putting the content in an iframe would give you the behaviour you are looking if losing most of the benefits of semantic html and css in order to implement the design you want then not going to sacrifice much more by taking a different approach to the

 prefer to divide my js files based on their function for i could have a single js file for all ajax based one for all validations and a common js library for all functions that are common to the entire web having a single file that combines the entire js scripts into one would definitely slow down the application because each page would load the entire even though only a small portion might be css i prefer to have a single common stylesheet that would contain the general styles available to the entire i might also create individual css files for pages that have a very specific layout know of any tools that could handle this dependency but when you divide your files according to this becomes unnecessary in most

 pretty new to and i realize i have a lot to so like to ask the so community for their using mvc and the online store building is just using 2 category and described by the following create table unsigned not null default default null references default default primary key table unsigned not null default default null references text default default null references of not default default default primary key online store is going to the structure of the category though we may add new categories in the right now all products are treated equally as product class with their being the only way to distinguish different types of the online store is also just one section of the the rest of the site contains information such as artist bios and thus i also have this a good or should i be creating separate subclasses for which inherit from the product like to link each music cd in the store to the discography entry to automatically generate track listings and other information for the product this is not a good way to go about how would you do it what should i include in my and should i only list products in leaf nodes of the category this design is as cyril pointed the field was and there are still no provisions for actually still trying to work out how best to design implement those aspects of the most i will just have another model called but actually processing orders is made more complicated by the fact that we are applying different shipping rates based on shipping destination and what the order this sound objected oriented design for an

 primitive way to do it would be to look out for network disconnection your sequence would for network connections status maintain a list of all active network the first available network connection you could sort it based on interface and use the one with highest you detect a down use the next active if there are implications to the functionality of your based on which network connection you you are much better having either a routing protocol do the job for or have a tracking application within your this tracking application would track network paths various methods like across all your available interfaces to see which one can reach the ultimate and use the appropriate network you could monitor your network interfaces for not just status but also for and change your selection this would help you use the most efficient network at any given point of but this would need to be balanced with the churn caused by switching a network

 probably want to use lists as a data structure for you might be better off creating a type or something which can contain text and child so that you can store the data in a tree hierarchy of something simple like this should do the class node private string private children new public string return public void public return should then be trivial to create a tree of these when you read in the and to use the same structure to write it back

 problem in have a big 2d point sparsely populated with of it as a big white canvas sprinkled with black have to iterate over and search through these dots a canvas can be bordering on the int and its size is unknown before setting points in brought me to the idea of need a hash function taking a 2d returning a unique that no collisions can can assume that the number on the canvas is easily countable by it is impossible to know the size of the canvas may even things like y sadly out of the also tried a very naive that produces too many hash function that provides keys with a low probability of ideas thanks for any had to change something in the question changed the assumption to count the number of points of the into to count the dots on the canvas the number of coordinate pairs to by original question make much because i would have had a sized which is uniquely a 16 bit shift and hope this is since all answers still make most sense with the updated for function providing unique uint from an integer coordinate

 problem is that the static variable in the derived the mynumber declaration in derivedclass hides the declaration in the base if you remove that then references to the in derived class static functions will refer to the base class of if you remove the declaration then you use a static initializer in the derived might want to consider requiring users to instantiate an instance of profilepictures rather than provide a static function for that way you could overide the gettempsavepath method to provide the correct you could simply set the value of the static path value in your derived class it is possible to use inheritance with static you relly have polymorphic behavior without a	
 problem is that you are importing your app as if it lives directly on the python and your urlconf as if it lives within a module on the python this can only work if both and are both on the python path runserver does for you automatically to things though it ends up just delaying the confusion until deployment you can emulate behavior by using the following line in your apache probably makes more sense to standardize your references so your python path only need include one or the the usual way least the way i see referenced more would be to put on the python path and qualify your app as instead of just i take the opposite approach and it works just put on your python path and set to instead of the advantage of this is that if in future you want to make your app reusable and move it out of the particular your references to it tied to the project name with an app named it sound like thinking in terms of reusable apps

 protect is definitely the better way to go what it is there i would strongly recommend you put all your users into and only ever use groups in your protections table much easier to can protect at any level of granularity you so is not note also that the server release has a new protect feature that allows you to specify what you can do in a slightly different change now allows specification of permission only allowed using permission levels which include the specified access and also of its lesser permissions permission rights make it possible to deny individual without having to lesser the new permission rights are and this functionality was previously and is now fully supported for you really have an issue with having to be an admin to lock unlock then you should take a look at the feature introduced in this will let a user to be able to add remove people from a so combine that with the protections get site admin to set up the protections and restrict rights to a group named and make you the group you can then add and remove users from that group to control trigger option is a but you still need to be an admin to set up the trigger in the first you could also affect performance of all which is something to look out but the main issue with triggers is that you would be using them to emulate a built in feature designed for that purpose protections if you wanted to be you would still need to find some way of preventing anyone else modifying the reference it just seems like a lot of work to emulate an existing

 reading a question on difference between pointers and i decided that like to use references instead of pointers for my class however it seems that this is not because they cannot be declared uninitialized the particular scenario working on right i want to use normal variables the correct term for them by the because automatically initialized when i declare my bar1 is automatically instantiated with the default constructor what i causes a compiler error because you use uninitialized references and is happy as larry because pointers can be declared uninitialized the is it best practice to set this to bar bar bar looks like i have to use pointers in this is this the best way of using the the syntax is a bit tough what about is this attempting to implement a reference variable field in my class and initializing it in the why might i receive the following in constructor uninitialized reference member the real also tried doing this in the but no luck get the same there is a default i neglected it because i thought it relevant to the problem foolish of after removing the default constructor i caused a compiler error because the class is used with a which requires there to be a default so it looks like i must use a default and therefore must use a or is i use pointers for my class	
 reading about and playing with rails last one of the tools that made the biggest impression on me was a database versioning system that keeps all dev identical integrated right into the like that would make life so much easier one of the things that i been able to figure do you move these changes to your production servers when you actually have access to the production we have multiple servers across the country that where the application is by a setup this question is more about strategy than specific we use we use but if i can figure out this publish there seem to be several tools being that might enable us to do something dotnet

 really depends on the ha system if your system uses a shared ip and the traffic is managed by some hardware then it can be hard to determine if a certain box is a master or that will depend on a specific solution as long as you can add a custom script to the you should be ok for example the controller can ping a daemon on the master server every in the alerting simply check if the time of the last ping 2 your system have a supervisor controller but each node tries to determine the state you can have more if a split brain you can end up with both slaves or both so your alerting software will be wrong in both gadgets that can ensure only one live node and could the other in the second if the ha software works on both hosts you should be able to obtain the information straight from it has to know its own state at any because one of its main in most ha solutions you should be able to either get the current or add some code to run when the state heartbeat offers worry about the edge cases like a split brain almost any situation when you lose connection between the clustered nodes will be more important than the stuff that happens on the separate nodes the thing you care about is really logging alerting then ideally you could have a separate logger box which gets all the information about the current network cluster external box will probably have better idea how to deal with the if your cluster gets disconnected from the network loses you get any a redundant pair of independent monitors can save you from not sure why you mentioned dns due to its refresh time it be a source of any cluster

 really like this i understand that it helps out with the case when you have an interface and an implementation that would have the same but i just find it still follow it if it were the convention where i am of consistency is the point of and consistency is a very good like to have an interface describe what the interface does in as generic a way as for a specific implementation that validates a particular thing would be a and an implementation with some abstract functionality shared by would be an i would do this even if is the thing that and would be cases where only one concrete class makes sense for an i still try to describe something specific about that particular implementation rather than naming the interface differently to prevent a names after going to be typing the name of the interface more often than the name of the

 reason for the separate i think is due to the fact that you cannot have two msi installations running at the same therefore if your application requires prerequisites installed by the msi your installation will run into regards to setting up the framework you could in the project settings include the framework as a prerequisite of your application and will this get installed if not already present on the target you can further choose to package the installation or download it from the	
 reason they generate two different sql queries is that by tries to optimize your sql queries for fewer when you include a list of conditions as part of your find that require the use of other tables then of course the resulting sql has to include a but if all asking to do is to objects with relationships to the objects retrieving then rails figures more efficient to perform several fast queries rather than one big slow that this does not cause an because rails will try to load all of the associated records in a single

 reason to do it is that it puts all of the initialization code in one place which is convenient for others reading your having said this i really do it for two primary i use testing to define the behavior of my if you want to know what the parameterless constructor you should really read the tests built on the parameterless with i typically use automatic properties and inline initialization with a parameterless constructor to instantiate the this is much more flexible and it puts the definition of the properties right in line where the code is being this would override any initialization in the constructor so i rarely put any of this only applies to var foo new foo bar public class public string bar public	
 reason you probably want to do that is because these calculations are sql server is usually licensed by the cpu socket for for so dbas are very sensitive to any applications that want to burn a lot of cpu power on the sql server if you started doing statistics calculations and suddenly the server needs another an expensive licensing it makes sense to do these statistical calculations on a separate application query the data over the wire to your app do the and then send the results back via an update statement or stored more but as your application you be facing an expensive licensing	
 reasons to do it the right are industry well and easy to while you fully support making life as easy as possible for the client you want to implement something easier in the short in preference to something not quite so easy for them but offers long term of my favourite and long after quick has departed the dirty you this one is a stitch in time saves

 receive 2 php lines that they have to insert into their is incredibly drags in code from the given url executes would never allow an affiliate network to add php code to my this gives an external site total control over my application and this is especially unacceptable running over unencrypted any attack can immediately compromise the also if you have a hole in your any end user can completely compromise the customer strongly advise finding a less insecure way to interface your network with you are only intending to return html to be shown in the final and not php you can do that using or the more usual method which is to have the affiliate insert a tag pointed at your include should also be using so that any characters in the parameter are correctly echo plus you like any time you output any text content to be using to encode otherwise you are vulnerable to scripting not at the enough information in your question to diagnose exactly what some of your affiliates are doing more concrete examples would be of but from what posted so far i have huge concerns about the security of your system at the most basic

 recently come across quite understand a few of the points mentioned in the author mentions the small annoyance of vs but seems to argue that it is actually necessary the without ever offering a did i miss the section in function it seems the problems can be solved with replacing the allocations if going to the trouble to implement an entire arena for making an be much basically the same as an except that it knows which arena to deallocate from when use templates in to determine that foo a constructor which needs to be do something for destructors in of overloading the author tries to do a why not this instead less i i memory allocation in argue entire article seems to revolve around classes with and located in a memory management while that could be and i argue with pretty limited in we have placement new and allocators what problems be solved with these in case just and in ideal what would replace invent syntax as necessary what would be simply to help me understand these problems with

 recently started work on a project which involves creating a reporting interface for a fairly old software responsible for managing some access control hardware like electronic door locks for have chosen cakephp for the task and all it involves is querying the database for the log records and displaying them on the the software is written in and uses msde version of microsoft sql server or and i was able to configure cakephp so that it successfully connects to the problem is that the developer of this software has chosen to store the logs in the database by creating a separate table for each so it looks like am not really familiar with msde but i still doubt that it is an acceptable practice to design and maintain a database like i do not know how the desktop software manages to parse query all the information when all in this format but my cakephp application is having some really hard time chewing this want to stick with mvc for the web application but i know how to implement the dooreventmodel in cakephp so that it gets the information from all the partitioned tried implementing some hacks like all select from all select from this sort of works but when i want to perform where restriction on the whole query or any other sql operator it one of the requests was that the application does not add or create any additional databases or tables and only uses the existing ones to display the reports so creating one huge table that includes all of the clustered ones is not really an just hope that someone will come up with an sqlserver function that will merge all tables into one for me every time i perform a query but i know this is a bit so open to all suggestions please remember that the solution must work with cakephp and as a single model in the data from multiple clustered tables as one

 recommend looking at this from a purely usability how are your users supposed to work while filling in most of the doing validation on both the control and the form level is what of there are many user interaction styles you can the users do what they and then check on their results on this can be excellent for expert allowing them to input things quickly and but leaves newbies and infrequent users rather at a each control as entered or on this can be especially for complex forms of course we but done poorly can prevent people from filling in forms incrementally in their own i prefer a visual indication that amiss if i do it impossible to enter anything this can be achieved through sliders for combo boxes for restricted edit boxes which prevent bad even in case there are some cases where you have to check whether combinations of values are worked with some cases where the values in some subsets of controls are dependent on each other by an not always feasible or worth the effort to provide the user with immediate feedback in these so a case can always be made for validating on agree with binary worrier that the ok check is the main if sure it should never be sure to log a warning if it and sniff such events through your support channels if but make the end user pay for programming

 reduce it to exception or empty return list to keep it as simple as return type new new should return this when the operation to fill the list has completed correctly with no obvious but no results are returned as this is what it implies this also means that code dependent on the return which loops through the list will need no special an exceptions should be thrown when something has gone wrong in the function cannot open connection cannot be made calculation returned garbage this is distinct from results

 s new enough least in some that it may be a little early to say exactly the been around for a fair long although we make up a cool name for any the short answer is the idea of doing a design is to model the domain very what looking at is a domain which is to say an model that describes the problem domain in the problem the idea is that a domain since it models the is relatively insensitive to and also tends to localize if for example your idea of what an employee is perhaps by adding a mailing address as well as a physical then those changes would be relatively you have that you have what i maintain are architectural decisions still to be for you have the unimplemented persistence which might indeed be simply construction of it could also be a hibernate or use python or even be something wild like a google appengine distributed table thing those decisions are made and with other than the domain modeling experimented with to some good result is doing the domain model in python and then building a simulator with it instead of implementing the final that makes for something the customer can experiment and also potentially allows you to make quantitative estimates about the things the final implementation must

 say functional programming lends itself particularly well to flight in functional languages be very useful for writing scientific though this is a slightly specialised probably be better off with a standard imperative language like as they would tend to have the better physics libraries as well as graphics both of which you would need to use very the oop approach might make it easier to represent your another point to consider is that far as i the popular flight simulators on the market today are written pretty much entirely in my philosophy is that if no particularly good reason that you should need to use functional then use a functional language nothing to stop you using functional constructs in i suspect going to have a lot less painful of a development process using the apis for and languages more commonly associated with game development has many commonalities with flight if you want to add some complex ai to the lisp might seem like a rather more obvious though even then i at all jump for and if really keen on using a functional i would recommend you go with one of the more general purpose ones like python or even mixed languages as opposed to which could end up getting rather ugly for such a

 say that explorer does the copying to the destination files so no way to directly write the destination this makes because the names of the source files can only come from the application that copied the data to the which need not be otoh the names of the destination files may actually because files of the same name could already exist in the destination and only explorer can create the modified names for the destination files by prepending of or by appending to the base file will need to provide the clipboard format for the windows explorer so that it can paste the the of standard clipboard suggests that is the right with this clipboard format you would provide a list of source file but the files do need to exist of so you need to save them to could try to make the process as as usually when a user copies data to the clipboard it is put there whether or not it will be used for a paste for your application that would mean that you would need to create the files and put the list of file names into the every windows does support a mode called which is used exactly for such basically you put only an empty stub of the data onto the and only when another application tries to access the data it will be requested from your so you could implement this in a way that only when the user tries to paste the files into explorer you would save them to disc and return the list of file	
 say that i have a database for managing a customer has all the basic properties that one might expect there are special kinds of customers called a distributor have any special properties in and of except that it can distribute products to certain markets which are stored in a market can think of two ways to go about distinguishing distributors from a discriminatory column in the customer table called this column would contain a value that would distinguish between and benefit of this approach is that very and new customer types can be added easily if drawback of this approach is that my market table which links markets and would in this case would really just be linking markets to there is no way to enforce that a market is linked to a customer of the distributor the customers table and create a distributor table that basically just has an id column and a foreign key column to the customer benefit of this approach is that my market table can now link to the distributor which only contains there is no chance of linking to a customer that is not a distributor might occur if a customer were changed from distributor to drawback of this approach is that much more and adding new customer types is very else might i be and what are your opinions on this design discriminatory column vs foreign

 say that you are downloading songs from a which leads me to believe that there is a server that is shuttling information to the media put the logic for this onto the server just use whatever regular media player is out on the server generate a feed of some sort which feeds the urls of the songs to download depending on the time of day on the server by an offset if the client supplies your program would read the feed and get the urls of the songs to and just feed the playlist to the media player download the songs and feed them to the media based on what the server tells	
 say the correct answer depends on what you actually want and as what will be worthwhile in the long run depends on what need in the long if your goal is to get applications deployed asap then the is surely the way to the value of a and system that exactly what you want be the other hand if you have time to learn a variety of new things which may apply in other domains and want to have the widest scope for customisation then something like turbogears is turbogears gives you maximum flexibility but you have to spend a lot of time reading external docs for things like and genshi to get anything useful done with the tg2 docs are deliberately less detailed than the tg1 docs in some cases because considered that the external docs are better than they used to whether this sort of thing is an obstacle or an investment depends on your own

 secure hash algorithm algorithm takes a message of less than 264 bits in length and produces a message the algorithm is slightly slower than but the larger message digest makes it more secure against collision and inversion the algorithm specified in the secure hash standard fips was developed by is a revision to sha that was published in the revision corrected an unpublished flaw in its design is very similar to the md4 family of hash functions developed by is also described in the ansi is an algorithm for it is the first algorithm known to be suitable for signing as well as and one of the first great advances in public key rsa is widely used in electronic commerce and is believed to be secure given sufficiently long keys and the use of most notable difference is that sha is an encryption algorithm whereas rsa is both an encryption as well as signing it was announced that it is possible to find a collision in in this research result is due to professor xiaoyun wang of tsinghua university in together with professors andrew yao and frances it extends the work of and which demonstrated that a collision could be found in what that means is that it is easier for a collision to occur in sha than in rsa but no two similar keys have ever been found that

 should think about how often you need to do the the elements from the many objects do you need to keep track is more frequent will help determine the optimum instead of make a complex just have a list of all types and add a pointer to the object for each type it is derived something like for an object that is of type registering each obejct in multiple it then becomes easy to do something to all object of a given type and that and my construct may not be the optimum depending on how you will use perhaps a hybrid approach storing only the class heirarchy in the this quite but you get the doforlist unaryfunction operator

 shuffle is a perfectly good way to do this you do not introduce a bias using the naive see	
 shuffle is the best you can do for random numbers in a specific range with no the reason that the method you describe generate numbers and put them in a set until you reach a specified is less efficient is because of that algorithm might never at best it will finish in an indeterminable amount of as compared to a which will always run in a highly predictable amount of to edits and as you indicate in the the range of numbers is very large and you want to select relatively few of them at random with no then the likelihood of repeats diminishes the bigger the difference in size between the range and the number of the smaller the likelihood of repeat and the better the performance will be for the algorithm you describe in the the the	
 sieve of eratosthenes works fine as illustrative way to find but i would implement it a little bit the essence is that you have to check numbers which are multiples of already known instead of using an array to store this you can also create a list of all sequential primes up to the square root of the number you are and then it suffices to go through the list of primes to check for you think of this does what you do on the but in a more quickly hacked implementation of what i mean copied from the web public class sieve private readonly primes new private int public one could add more to speed things up a but one is public bool first check if we can compare against known if return if make sure that we got all primes up to the square of int maxfactor while bool isprime for primeindex primeindex int prime if prime isprime if now apply the sieve to the number to foreach prime in if prime return if return about 67ms on my slow test program static void stopwatch sw new sieve sieve new for i i

 simple and somewhat inaccurate way to do this would be to decrease the granularity of your it might not even be depending on how accurate your y measurements say we have the following y we floor the x and y we y 5 5 5 we can average those values by the floored x and y to show that we have average signal strength in the rectangle to the as as 1 as 1 as as table by ideally want to group data points by distance from point to and this groups them by a maximum distance that varies from 1 and to flooring them into rectangular so less than but it may work well enough for especially if the is less than the error in your measurement of is not granular you can use x someweight to adjust it to the granularity you and of course you can use or to do the same whole point is to a bunch of nearby measurements to one and then take the average of the collapsed

 since these higher level manage the memory for what you use data structures main reason for using a data structure is not about garbage but it is about storing data in a way that is efficient in some so what matters most is how you are organizing the which is exactly what the language automatically figure out for the high level language will come with several preloaded data structures should use these preloaded data structures when they are provided instead of making your but not all data structures are provided that you may structures organize the storage of memory in some way so that the algorithms that run on them can be implemented giving efficient most tasks you need to implement your own data but this depends fully on what you are can understand the need for and stacks but would you ever need use a binary tree in are a lot of examples for using a binary but not in common every day for example you may need to implement huffman data can be used to have the space savings and fast lookups of using a or you may need to store a lot of data with fast lookup by using a several data structures have specific uses and are optimized for different whether the language is modern or not and whether it has garbage collection or not change trend is that custom implemented data structures are coded and thought about a similar argument happens with common in more modern like linq you simply specify to you actually say how to

 snapshot is not the full set of basically only changed is incomplete without the source you create a database from a database snapshots and requirements of database	
 snapshots an audit trail is a common database for many creating or audit tables is an easy and straight forward while database level backups and transaction logs are good to they are not a version control you need create a shadow table with all the same columns as the base and then setup triggers on the base table to place a copy of the row in the shadow table when ever it is updated or some logic you can recreate what the data looked like at a given point in for an easy way to set this up in sybase you need to do lots of historical then you can keep the data in the same create two columns an added and deleted the downside is for every query you must add a where of course you can create a which shows just the active this gets a bit more complicated if you have a normalized database with multiple all with it does you simply have the and columns on each and then your query has the point in time of whenever data is modified you must copy the current and mark it as

 solving the wrong the problem is that you have data which you want your users to and that stored in a location to which the users have start by attempting to fix the problem of users with more access than they you protect the whole you may want to look into just protecting the move it to a separate location and encrypt encrypt the data with a key only accessible by a specific id not and write a small suid program to access the in your setuid do your validation of who should be running the and compare the name checksum of the calling program can inspect the command line for the process in combination with the calling cwd to find the use lsof or the with the expected value before it takes more than you really need to reevaluate the state of users on the system they either have too much access or you have too little

 some on a 3ghz powerpc on that a virtual function call costs 7 nanoseconds longer than a direct function not really worth worrying about the cost unless the function is something like a trivial in which anything other than inline is kind of a 7ns overhead on a function that inlines to is a 7ns overhead on a function that takes 500ms to execute is big cost of virtual functions really the lookup of a function pointer in the vtable usually just a single but that the indirect jump usually cannot be this can cause a large pipeline bubble as the processor cannot fetch any instructions until the indirect jump call through the function has retired and a new instruction pointer the cost of a virtual function call is much bigger than it might seem from looking at the but still only 7 not and others also raise the very good point that a virtual function call may cause an instruction cache if you jump to a code address that is not in cache then the whole program comes to a dead halt while the instructions are fetched from main this is a significant on about 650 cycles my this a problem specific to virtual functions because even a direct function call will cause a miss if you jump to instructions that in what matters is whether the function has been run before recently it more likely to be in and whether your architecture can predict static branches and fetch those instructions into cache ahead of my ppc does but maybe most recent hardware timings control for the influence of icache misses on execution since i was trying to examine the cpu pipeline in so they discount that

 sounds to me like you are trying to do a rather than this kind of thing is usually tackled using event i did something similar in haskell a few years and rolled my own discrete event simulation library based on the continuation monad afraid its owned by my so i post but it too a continuation is effectively a suspended so define something like this sim r a contt r threadqueue io threadqueue tq sim r threadqueue inside the state holds the queue of currently scheduled you can also have other types of thread queue to hold threads that are not for instance in a semaphore on once you have semaphores you can build the equivalent of mvars and schedule a thread use the argument to is a function that itself takes a function as an this inner argument is the calling it resumes the when you do from that point of view just returned the value you gave as an argument to in practice you need to pass values back to the suspended so the parameter type is your argument to is a lambda function that takes and puts it on the end of whatever queue is appropriate for the action you are then it takes the head of the threadqueue from inside the state and calls you need to worry about this function it never

 surprised that while people mentioned the logical array approach of indexing an nobody mentioned the find if x is an nxmxo works by generating an nxmxo logical array and using it to index x can be bad if you have large arrays and are looking for a small works by generating list of indices of x that satisfy and indexing x by should be used more than it in my what i would call can to arrays and cell arrays if you know the size by using end 1 with higher dimensions so long as the dimensions of the slice match so have to initialize x to something other than in that not good for numerics but for small dynamic lists of things cell parsing 1 2 1 2 3 think many people know is that for works on any dim 1 so to continue the for n means if all you need is the members of x you need to index also works with cell arrays but a bit annoying because as it walks them the element is still wrapped in a for el to get at the elements you have to subscript for el remember if there is a nicer way around

 take on this is that model binders should be constructing presentation not entity types from your the model binder should be a very simple mapping from the collection of the form to a presentation model which is mostly scalar values with possibly some relationships to other types that are mostly scalar values or having to materialize entity instances from a repository adds a lot of as you have using a presentation model has a large number of is never a need to whitelist the fields the user is allowed to since the presentation model contains only those default model binder will work for all but the most complex model binding in i find that i only need to use a custom model binder when the value the user sees has to be bound to some other value in a conditional when using a presentation model the structure of your presentation model should match the structure of the so you do not need to use a custom model binder for structural will be able to create your views and controllers before creating a database or entity this means you can get customer on your design before doing a large amount of the work to create the final this helps to sort out structural issues in the entity model before they just create a presentation model which matches the page you think the customer wants to build the general outline of the page using a instance of this presentation and show it to the if you can then build the model and write a linq query to map that to your presentation in your the subcategories would come in from the form collection as a list of the presentation model should have the same list of in the after you can call a method to transfer the model values from the presentation model to a materialized category instance from the

 tend to think that keeping with the latest version is a good that mean upgrading as soon as the product is released but within a relatively short timeframe afterwards can be for application java found that vendors generally provide a reasonably straightforward upgrade path from version to version and upgrading becomes more problematic if the upgrade must skip a few versions framework an application is working well in production without any problems i can understand the desire not to change anything and avoid the overhead of regression with more widespread adoption of automated unit if a new version offers significant benefits in terms of performance features is it worth found in my experience that products are not usually kept and when the particular version of the product is no longer supported the task of upgrading to the latest version tends to be quite time consuming and question it a good idea to keep with the latest version of major system components such as operating application we have oracle application server which is certified to use up to java sdk the latest version of java is now is currently in the and oracle application server is up to is certified for sdk upgrading to sdk it opens up the possibility for new applications being developed to use existing infrastructure to use more current versions of supporting frameworks such as hibernate or ibatis as well as later standards for these upgrades are not done the new application being developed is limited to using old versions and consequently will add to the time and cost of future upgrade or not to

 the answer is definitively to the first the halting problem does not prove in what suggesting proves the halting problem does not apply to real digital and used this very example as a proof of it a deterministic digital system a program running on real digital the number of possible states is and therefore all possible states are exact amount of memory required for the hash would state of initial initial state would be your hash and final state would be the hash and then have a pair for each initial an operating the state is gigabits of memory across all system such a general purpose program would require an impractical amount of memory to and would not be useful since the system is complex next user input depends on previous system is highly because if you index every possible initial state and associate it with the terminating you would effectively bring the running time of any program to any by zero i mean a very fast running time the time it takes to look up the terminating state it a starting from each of all possible will provide a kind of state map showing halting problem is therefore because there are only three four collapsing to possibilities given any possible initial program will reenter a previously encountered state the initial before exhausting all possible and therefore logically loops program reaches a state identified as before it has a chance to reenter a previously encountered state or exhaust all possible states the initial the simplest program will start from an initial will enter all possible states exactly and then has no choice but to halt or reenter a previously encountered state and loop i will reach roll over back to at which point it will have reentered the initial your index could be described like each initial there is exactly one or zero terminating other for each initial the program either reaches a terminating state a state already encountered since the initial state and cycles for any program running on digital it is often to determine all its states and whether it halts or loops practicality depends solely on how many valid initial states you have you can reduce with input and how feasible it is to take the time to run the program for each of them to termination and store the resulting state in the hash forcing any running time an other uses of capturing state include the function in game console emulators and the hibernate feature of computers not a perfect restoration of since some system memory must be used for the code that restores the state and some memory may never be stored gpu this proves is that any program can be represented by a hash program can be represented by an programs can be simplified to one big function with a massive

 the data that caching is required by more than one it sounds like from a service oriented architecture anyway that it belong in either of services you have calling the data being cached really related to either but is something that both services then perhaps it belongs in own seperate have you considered encapsulating your cache in a third and performing a call to retrieve the data you benefits solves your original avoiding the need to read the whole cache from the database several encapsulates the cache in one place for easy allows you to abstract the implementation of the cache away from the other services by putting another service interface in the in suggest the best the only downside is the extra overhead of making the but that surely outperforms having to read the whole cache from the if the data in your cache is very closely related to both of the services that are calling the both services the data in the then perhaps the two existing services should be combined into a single what saying is making some then then principle of soa drawing on is

 the file into smaller likely eating up a lot of memory space doing nothing but shifting bits either in memory or on is similar to how much faster to on an array of strings rather than a single only trick of it is to make sure where you put the break in the file a good which is relatively in if you can do it by even no need to check against also find it strange that it would take perl there is some anecdotal evidence to suggest that it can handle that in less than an they talk about 1gb files taking 2 minutes in the second i suspect that a replacement operation should take significantly longer than a copy operation for a after just picking up chunks of the file and replacing some of the bits as you move it should be able to replace them on the fly near the speed of copying them they are already in

 the first portion recommend using the anchor property on usercontrol instead of trying to size this it works very and very for handling window you want to do you should probably look at chaining off instead of and probably setting your control too and unachoring the panel or other thing sitting which causes all sorts of second part is due to the fact that gridnamevalue is a member of a you call returning a size then trying to set the width on the returned struct the this is why you need to set the entire size valuetype in one creating a new and setting it to is the only way to make that

 the other answers say about it being impossible to accurately predict the performance of code running on a modern cpu is but that mean the latencies are or that knowing them is exact latencies for intels and processors are listed in the manuals shown in can berk also has pdf manuals on their own website with the official tight knowing the latencies for each instruction can help a lot in manually trying to schedule your the programmer can make a lot of optimizations that the compiler the compiler guarantee it change the meaning of the this still requires you to know a lot of other details about the such as how deeply pipelined it how many instructions it can issue per number of execution units and so and of these numbers vary for different but you can often come up with a reasonable average that more or less works for all worth noting that it is a lot of work to optimize even a few lines of code at this and it is easy to make something that turns out to be a modern cpus are hugely and they try extremely hard to get good performance out of bad but there are also cases unable to handle or where you clever and making efficient and it turns out to slow the cpu in optimization table first column is instruction then there is a number of columns for latency for each the cpuid indicates which processor family the numbers apply and are explained elsewhere in the the latency specifies how many cycles it takes before the result of the instruction is so this is the number looking throughput columns show how many of this type of instructions can be executed per up xchg in this we see that depending on the cpu it takes and a mov takes looked up what each cpuid but i assume the are for pentium which ran some components of the chip at double allowing it to do things in half really see what you plan to use this information but if you know the exact cpu family the code is running then adding up the latency tells you the minimum number of cycles required to execute this sequence of

 the reasons string are immutable in java have much to do with the two main reasons are the are extremely widely used type of it is therefore more or less guaranteed to be used in a strings are immutable to make sure that it is safe to share strings among having an immutable strings ensures that when passing strings from thread a to another thread thread b cannot unexpectedly modify thread only does this help simplify the already pretty complicated task of but it also helps with performance of access to mutable objects must somehow be synchronized when they can be accessed from multiple to make sure that one thread attempt to read the value of your object while it is being modified by another proper synchronization is both hard to do correctly for the and expensive at immutable objects cannot be modified and therefore do not need string interning has been it only represents a small gain in memory efficiency for java only string literals are this means that only the strings which are the same in your will share the same string if your program dynamically creates string that are the they will be represented in different immutable strings allow them to share their internal for many string this means that the underlying array of characters does not need to be for say you want to take the five first characters of in you would calls in this what the method does is simply to create a new string object that shares underlying but who knows that it starts at index 0 and ends at index 5 of that to put this in graphical you would end up with the mystring v quick brown fox jumps over the lazy shared makes this kind of operations extremely and since the operation neither depends on the length of the original nor on the length of the substring we need to this behavior also has some memory since many strings can share their underlying

 the rigidity of clear interfaces mean that flexible code must be use java and perl as respective not that code being messy makes it but that code being flexible makes it almost has a different meaning in exploratory code vs older perhaps talking about thanks to mario pays much attention to the content of the language and standard libraries are steeped in oo and it even has the extensively used keyword the jvm and language themselves have specifications of external has a history of clear and open specifications a clear interface that works well is very difficult to do but when done the result can be very a specification an oo is by its nature rigid any flexibility it has is rigidly circumscribed by the result is that if you correctly predicted the the degrees of freedom the design has great clarity and precision it will actually act as a towards the right questions to and give you useful terms with which to think about the spirit of perl is more than one way to do and the language syntax itself has evolved considerably over the years incompatible like this attitude carries on into programs written in the one can write perl to clear it and often this can result is code but if you understand you can change it in arbitrary that it is ugly but flexible perhaps my definition of ugly needs to mjd said of order that he have written it with because it would lack the flexibility he i hope not putting words in his mouth but i think the same would apply to interfaces and specifications that is something that tdd seems to me that java code tends be neat but and perl code to be messy but java upfront and perl favors my code i keep facing a choice between neat for i compared a visitor pattern against one big function of cascading latter is but it is many times easier to add parameters to the recursive method calls is only a problem if you need that degree of flexibility i find i do in exploratory the visitor pattern refactors the as method at the cost of defining and calling those one class per so that an added argument must be added to all those methods and all the calls of in all those i coded these designs and counted how many places needed arguments 9 places for visitor different 3 places for in one the solution is much easier to even though question about java and perl just using them as illustrative examples to make the question more concrete and and hopefully easier to arbitrarily flexible code necessarily being arbitrarily flexible make code	
 the risk of being back an opposing point of view i first encountered while reading on it was a point of view that was very but made sense to me upon and setters are of getters and setters is in opposition to the fundamentals of object oriented data abstraction and overuse of getters and setters will make your code less agile and maintainable in the long they ultimately expose the underlying implementation of your locking implementation details into the interface of the your field needs to change from a to another string is better optimized or supports a different need to change the private data the the and all the client code of this class that calls these getters and than design your classes to and design them to or ask yourself why writing a what are you doing with that perhaps displaying that data on or doing some processing on is this process better exposed as a method of not to say that getters and setters have their in i believe the fundamental reason for their use is to interface with the visual studio but if you find yourself writing them in probably best to take a step look at your and see if something is try to an example to a class that represents a bank account int in lets say const return void deposit int const return void dostuffwithaccount account print account int balance deposit some money into deposit take very long to see that this is very poorly are an awful currency deposit should be a function of the getters and setters make it more difficult to fix the since the client code dostuffwithaccount is now bound to the we used to implement the account lets make a pass on this code and see what we can a class that represents a bank account float void void void o dostuffwithaccount account print account deposit some money into float depositamt is a step in the right you could have changed the internal type to and still supported the account int old float support the old const return void provide a new interface for the float const return not how to expose getter for float as well as void it take long to realize that the arrangement is doubling your workload and complicating matters as you need to support both the code that used ints and the new code that will use the deposit function makes it a bit easier to expand the range of types for class is probably not the best since the account balance is a natural operation for an the overall is that you must be careful with getters and do not get into the habit of writing getters and setters for every it is quite easy to expose and lock yourself into an implementation if you are not

 there an easy method of accessing custom configuration data through a interface without requiring each execution context from configuration information which would be computationally like most other classes in library are annotated with the following public static in visual members of this type are thread any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread my reading of the objects returned from the and other similar methods must not be assumed to be and thus should not be used by multiple execution this prohibits storing a in a singleton that would otherwise be because while the access to the section object may be the members on the object itself are not calls to are likely to require of the configuration files and allocating new instances which has a high overhead considering the configuration is not likely to ever change after copying the configuration data into another object that has been made seems to defeat one of the main benefits of using the configuration package in the first place access to and validated configuration information without much boilerplate is there a way to use in a manner without resorting to excess parsing and allocations of configuration does implementing your own free you from the lack of guarantee provided by microsoft even though accessing it through the interfaces if how would you implement it to be when access to the base indexer is required for accessing the configured safe usage of

 there is no need to expose a setter for the bars internally you hold a reference to the which as kent suggests could be marked as through the getter the caller can do what they want with the collection with the methods available but crucially they can never change the internal reference you hold to the collection then allows you to control what methods are as jamie having the property return type would result in the bars property exposing a readonly exposing means the contents of the collection could be a setter on the property would leave it wide open for the caller to do what they want and you are no longer in the question edit it really depends on how the object will be your main concern is to initialise from an existing list of bars list of bars previously latest code example for forces the caller to initialise via the constructor but then also allows them to change the collection via the foo new allowing an object to be initialised via the constructor you need to ask yourself why you are doing is the to allow the calling code to supply values that can be subsequently changed via you want to restrict how the object is forcing values certain combinations of to be set on object construction and remain fixed throughout the lifetime of the need to ask yourself do you want the caller to be able to change the contents of the bars collection after the object has been no make the bars property expose a read only yes add a default constructor to the object so that the caller have to supply a list to initialise but they will have the option to do so if they so choose via the overloaded	
 there is no portable way to restrict the number of characters input in but whatever platform you are using will provide some for example on look up you do go with plain old iostreams input from a good idea to read the initial text into a using this will prevent buffer because resize as code involving is technically safe in that it read more than 5 characters into but this code is fragile if you later decide you want 6 you could easily forget to update your call to leading to you need to remember to but as i use you read the input into a using or some once in there you need to get it out in the form of a this is where the class is useful it lets you treat an existing as a stream to read so you can use the formatted input cerr went seriously extract an integer value from the stream that wraps extraction failed a more serious problem like eof cerr a number else if 1000 i cerr of else process using you can actually just extract directly from instead of going via a and an extract an integer value from this can have subtle undesirable any additional characters on the line typed by the user particular the typed when they press will remain in the input buffer to be read by the next often this but sometimes it if you follow up with expecting that this will wait for a it it will just read the the first character the user

 there is no the reason there are so many people that agree with this design decision is because they did not learn to master the power of people need to write a lot of custom copy comparison operators and destructors because they use raw pointers in their using appropriate smart pointers the default copy constructor is usually fine and the obvious implementation of the hypothetical default comparison operator would be as

 there should be no problem putting them all inside of a when inside of a class you can name any variable defined so far simply by naming a b c a yields the result because while python is executing a class body the functions can the variables a and b that have been so the following also def def what about your merger the problem is that the wrapper function gets run long the class body is done and the variables it defined are no longer in the enclosing how can you refer to by using the name of the class as a like def def def def def the general rule with python code that runs right at the level of the class body can talk about all the variables and methods that have been defined so far inside of and this means you can use those class variables as but once you are of a function in the whether a class a static or a method this wrapper is a class method since it takes args but no then you have to use the name of the class to its craig craig

 thilo but explain a little further webserver is this is really the problem of the you just log and then say now this user is logged you need some way to identify which user it is requesting a new site this common way of doing this is by implementing if you your network traffic while logging and then browsing a site commonly notice something like you will transmit your username and password to the completely https will encrypt this request for you to avoid you will receive a randomly generated string of a lot of weird these will typically be stored in a of some site only you should have access you will transmit the randomly generated string to the the server will look this string and see that associated with your this allows the server to identify and grant you access to your http in itself is not this means that your password and your randomly generated will be transmitted completely if someone has access to your traffic router he will be able to see your username password when you log if not using this will grant him access to your site untill you change your password he changes it first in the rest of the requests he will be able to get your session which means he could steal your identity for the rest of that cookie lifecycle you log or the session expires on the you want to feel use realistically a lot easier to social engineer a keylogger into your computer than it is to read all your traffic as others have pointed use to read your session

 thing i think you need to consider is that a generic collection is not always a drop in replacement for a for can simply be plugged in for an instance of they have very different behavior in a number of scenarios that can and will break switching between these two collections forces a good programmer to examine the use cases to ensure the differences do not bite	
 thing not mentioned to the answers give so far is that any assembly running in the or winforms app will recognize the via the as when you put the config info into the config the assemblies used in the app can read those the only thing you have to do document as good is make sure the config has a named element that the you have a in a winforms app that expects the application hosting the to have an entry in named your code would cs as string dll can be used in many different hosting and as long as myappconn is defined in the hosting the dll will get the connection myappconn can point to different databases in each hosting if	
 thing that can be done is to use javascript to grab the current time when a event occurs that triggers a to your passing this value back to your server side will allow you to render it back to the client as your initial time that you can compare of using i believe you can put script inline at the end of the document so that it runs as soon as the browser renders that portion of the this will allow you to compare the current time when the inline script runs against the trigger time that was captured when the user initiated the as mentioned by since you can only reliably control the of the it would be best to include in your metrics the server page generation if you have both you can at least see how much of the total time is taken by page and how much is dependent on the various delays that could occur on the

 thing to consider is using an raii class to manage the allocation of course only useful if your macro can be restricted to you want to avoid hitting the heap for performance take a look at the techniques used by matthew template class this will allocate on the stack unless your runtime size request exceeds a size specified at compiler time so you get the speed of no heap allocation for the majority of allocations you size the template but everything still works correctly if your exceed that stlsoft has a whole lot of cruft to deal with portability you may want to look at a simpler version of which is described in found it quite handy in an embedded

 things going on you have obvious blanks in your xml character 456 should really strip out that that is likely what is causing the return value of to be if you can remove it at the if you can strip it out on the receiving end by reason you use is that you store an nsinteger value in an both keys and values in the dictionary have to descend from and nsinteger is just a typedef of so you should use an nsnumber

 things stand out in my was designed before unix at the isolating yourself from the host os seemed like a great idea since to have a decent level of integration with all the operating systems in use would be prohibitively and on top of that would make things that should be simple ridiculously the backwards that common lisp has to do to support things like the vax now it just looks of free at the it been demonstrated that a language needed a solid implementation to pick up people still thought that selling was a good way to make seem like really obvious mistakes in but i guess you just had to be

 think a answer for really dependent upon the architecture chosen for your state if all the logic for changing state were encapsulated within your order then i would say it would be poor practice to expose a setstate since you have already placed some of the logic outside the order it seems appropriate to expose a public setstate or something your other choice would be to move the logic into the order based on what it seems as if that would create a very complex in patterns are really just there to help you architect your not to set hard and fast you should apply patterns to your architecture in the way that works not architect to

 think a few more steps to accomplishing your which is understanding the basics of game you mentioned understanding sprites and which are imperative to game but i think that initially you should spend a little time understanding the programming and methodology behind general graphical user of what language you will eventually program your game i think that learning in a modern language like java or will provide you with a vast amount of libraries and will allow you to accomplish tasks like animation and event listeners much more is a list of guides and tutorials that i think will be extremely helpful to you just as they were to me and is an for a java game framework that includes full source code and a full walk through source of writing the infamous game in complete with a control score and sound book java 5 game by jonathan harbour will introduce you to concepts such as 2d vector graphics and bitmap including sprite plus you can get it used on amazon marketplace for is an unbelievable tutorial on sprite animation that has more than 5 parts to plus written by richard a professor of compsci and an extremely reliable and knowledgeable for more tutorials by is his these sources going to possess the methodology of the parts that go into a which are applicable in any as well as the knowledge of how those parts can be actually implemented as

 think that best approach for you to take hen explaining this to your is by examples drawn from well known and succesful software and the way they approach major and minor first thing i would say is that the dot notation for releases is a relatively recent for most releases of unix actually had names sometimes included a meaningless rather than version assuming you want to use then the major number indicates a version that is basically incompatible with much that went consider the change from windows to most applications simply fit in with the new overlapped windows in windows for less a radical change in file formats could be a reason for a major version change wp graphic apps often work this other reason for a major version number change is that the user notices a once again this was true for the change from windows to and was responsible forv the latters if your app looks very a major for the minor version this is typically used to indicate a chanhe that actually is quite but that be noticeable to the for the differences internally between win and win were actually quite but the interface stayed the the third version well few people know hat it really means and fewer for in my everyday work i use the gnu compiler version how does this differ from i a

 think that there is an automatic way of doing but you could always use to traverse the visual tree of your silverlight and pick out the value of any controls that interest it be easier to just bind the controls to properties on a viewmodel you could add a method to the class that would then build the post request for based on the properties that it is

 think the most interesting thing you can do with and powershell is to build these are essentially plugins to powershell that are written in managed code and act like normal they have a pair and many of the functions you already use are actually cmdlets under the	
 think the pattern best for your situation is your have to know what class sending this data you would implement a logincontrollerdelegate in your you would implement a property like id when actually got something to communicate to the you would write object that should receive the login ids would incorporate the protocol like someotherclass nsobject you would implement the method in instead of your needing to have intimate knowledge of the other classes in your you simply establish a mechanism for sending that data to whatever object is interested in it when it becomes if you later change which object should receive the login you only need to choose a different

 think the problem is your qpainter could just create the qpainter like in it would look like this public qwidget virtual void qpainter int n qreal fangle 2 i qreal x 50 qreal y 50 could also use something like but i really recommend it just prefer the other public qwidget qpainter virtual void int n qreal fangle 2 i qreal x 50 qreal y 50 and calls are essential in the second in the first you can think of being called in the constructor and in the the qpaintdevices are usually double buffered in might be where the image is transferred to the graphic	
 think the simple solution will be to create a fake instance of the singleton class and use swapnextinstace before the actual class constructor is void var fake set additional behavior on singleton this is where the class constructor is being var result result solution should work with most scenarios unless the singleton class is created before the you need to set behavior after the class was created just use void var fake var result result

 think there are basically three reasons for growth have you ever used i know about most but for none of the marketing material on the gwt site was very then i ran into a little small personal project that required integration with google maps and app i decided to try gwt since the tools made it so using it even for an extremely modest project has completely changed my i suspect this means there has been a lot of word of mouth propagation of the framework over the past 6 the early versions used by google all that much and were a bit rough around the the latest releases seem to have solved most of the growing pain issues compile times are still too and have turned it into a usable started including a set of default i think this has helped their demos to look quite a bit more impressive for recent whereas some people were confused in the past by the out of the approach that the project had be really shocked if any of these apply outside of java i seen gwt making inroads into environments at and i think their current direction makes success even more	
 think there are two related issues one is the question of code which many of the other responders have commented on in if you can easily reuse the you second question is whether it is sensible to have two applications with substantially different behaviors share a common user this is the more interesting question i the answer depends on what your applications are used for the various applications in an office suite often share a substantial amount of the user interface they have common generally considered as it makes it easy for a user familiar with one application to work with another from the same the other you can imagine cases where sharing the ui will only lead to frustration and agony for your as an extreme suppose you have an smarthouse which allows you to control various aspects of your ultra modern smart in this you have a control that allows you to turn off the cooling system in the this involves a button with a clever icon of a melting ice cube or when you click the a dialog is shown asking the user to confirm the suppose you need to write nuclearpowerplant thinking to save some development you crib the ui from smarthouse lots of things line up just even a need for a button to turn off the cooling system in this new so you reuse the ui from the first your users have all been using smarthouse 2009 for months and and they have gotten very used to turning off the home with that ingrained into them that using that button is a relatively harmless one some poor user comes to the office and logs into nuclearpowerplant he feels a little bit so he clicks on the melting ice cube expecting it to turn off the he even clicks through the next dialog been doing this for months at too bad for he disables the power plant cooling triggering a massive nuclear this is an extreme fictional but you could easily imagine situations in ordinary where a user gets used to a button in app a doing a particular kind of and assumes that a similar button in app b will do a similar kind of if it your users will curse you every time they hit that the question how similar are your applications are the conceptually the but operating on different types of or data from different are they related in that they are part of a suite of tools with many common actions between the or are they really unrelated if they are what is the probability that a user of app a will ever need to use app

 think this depends on whether the framework genuinely solves a for and solves it people always find this a terribly controversial thing to say for some but most of the frameworks considered using ending up ditching halfway through because just easier to write some code to do exactly what i when i have a problem in my i can just go to where the problem is and add a line of code to fix rather than wading through pages of documentation to find the magic configuration if i have a problem with favourite i generally find around for ages when the underlying problem that the framework is supposed to be solving was never that complicated in the first favourite useless frameworks are ones that require lots of configuration and clumsy boilerplate code to do basic tasks such as sending some bytes down a socket or stuffing some parameters into a prepared statement and firing it off to a another of my favourites are the whole raft of especially ones that are or do i want a parser rather than just one parser that always call me victor but amazing how people can turn a regular expression problem into a that there are people who absolutely thrive on things with in them etc so clearly for some people in some a and just missing out in it depends on whether you or your organisation primarily have and things expertese or i suppose i have more of the

 think we need to know a bit more about what you are looking can you clarify your question a in particular does the service to work across all one or a particular the numbers be unique or just on your question there appear to be a couple of different items you may be looking a sequential group of numbers across all processes on the no such service one should be fairly easy to write but getting it to work across all processes is a unique sequential group of numbers across all processes on the variation on the first such a service does not exist because it would be impossible to there is no way to guarantee a unique sequential number using the data types simply because the value will eventually overflow and leave you with a duplicate a method of getting unique values in the several other users have mentioned the best choice is a you can create a new one using for almost all purposes they can be considered unique but are not

 think why not as long as you keep the usual crt memory boundaries if you allocate memory inside a library always free it from inside the library by calling a function in the lib to do the approach works fine for dlls compiled with all kinds of statically linked libs should be ok	
 think with the first approach you are not tying your design down in any you could load services and easily add new services in the future there is no code binding to the exact service type as in the second	
 think you are being too what some people do with session objects is not always a good but there is nothing inherently wrong with the is a good use of session objects in the right for caching user specific data that is stored in the db and frequently change except by the actions of that this incurs a memory penalty on the web server as a for fewer hits on the db i am happy to make this because it is far simpler and cheaper to scale to multiple web servers than multiple sql general rule of thumb is to use sessions only for caching that if the code easily reload itself after a session expires without intervention from the i go	
 think you are misunderstanding idea behind using unions is toe save one and get result equivalent to not they looks similar in source but it is a completely different like apples and are a very low level construct that allows you to see a piece of memory as if storing any of its but you only can use at a even the use of the word is extremely they should be called or not you int double char are a piece of memory big enough for the biggest among an a char and a and lets call it that now you can store an a a if you store an and then store a the int is gone the point are two major uses for discriminated what we did i pick a piece of memory and i give it different meanings depending on sometimes the context is explicit keep some variable that indicates what of variable you and sometimes it can be implicit of the section of you can tell which one must be in either the code needs to be able to figure it or you be able to do anything sensible with the typical example would int typeindicator an a a abcunion are unions not unlike the above more split is sometimes useful when you need to be able to see a variable as either a or as a combination of easier to explain with an unsigned char unsigned char short a short int with a pair of you can view the same value as either a short int or you can just as easily study the individual bytes that make part of the value and that this second use is not portable pretty meaning that not guaranteed to work across different machine but this use is absolutely essential for the kind of tasks for which c was designed

 think you should share your profile in a brief to get a better hibernate and spring are hot and you will find them in all job requirements posted for enterprise so you are on the right track as far as your selection choices is hibernate is trickier than reason for that spring by virtue of its architecture is least invasive to the is little api to to code in you have to really code anything beyond to code you need to know the hibernate apis and the gotchas of hibernate the basics of hibernate are easy to but to learn the tricks and it takes i was the hiring manager and were using hibnernate and would rather take someone who was stronger on hibernate rather than someone who was stronger on far as spring is you as a contributing will have little to worry likely the application will already have a framework in and you will have to plug in your contributions to code in like i said its better if you have soem experience on i know everyone has a different viewpoint on so you maybe getting more confused once you share a bit of your it will help people give you a better good luck

 this have anything to do with the fact that you have a surrogate key in the storeproducts table happens if you remove this surrogate key column and put the primary key on the combination of the and columns believe if you want to have a surrogate key on the storeproducts have to create yet another you want to use the surrogate have to use the idbag does your product class and mapping look like see that you specify the attribute in your mapping of the products collection in the store you do this thus you have a then you should add the store to the stores collection of the product as the nh made only to the inverse of the association are not this means that nhibernate has representations in memory for bidirectional one from a to b and another link from b this is easier to understand if think about the object model how we create a relationship in the category now about the the item now about the no nothing will be the relationship will be side is used to the representation to we would get an and probably even foreign key violation if both trigger the same is of also true for may map a association by mapping association to the table as a association and declaring end that only one of the ends should be a product to a should be done like class public void product p false class public void store s false important to check whether the collection already contains the item to be otherwise end up in an infinite

 this is not difficult to achieve at all and its not a bad idea at it all depends on your project a lot of software products you not projects but depend upon this model so they dont have to rewrite their code ui logic for different client clients can customize their ui the way they want to using a designer form in the admin have used xml for preserving meta data for this sort of some of the attributes which i saved for every field for list multi check box yes then check if no then drop down show or not to on the web positioning i did not care much and simply generate table tr td tags 1 below the other however if you want to implement this as you can have 1 more attribute called cssclass where you can define ui specific properties and also note a lot of ecommerce products follow this kind of dynamic ui when you want to enter product information as their clients can be selling everything under the sun from furniture to sex toys so instead of rewriting their code for every different industry they simply let their clients enter meta data for product attributes via an admin form would also recommend you to look at it has its own pros and cons but i feel it can be used quite well with your

 typechecking arguments in python is not it is your code accepts either a string or a dict your design is comes from the fact that if you know already the type of an your own then doing something wrong hurts code reuse and reduces having a function different things depending on the type of the object passed is and has a behavior harder to understand and have the following saner make a function that converts dicts in unique lists of return your function assume the argument passed is always a that if you need to pass a string to the you just you need to pass it a you your best it is easy to understand and the code immediatelly understands what is and you make two one that accepts lists of strings and one that accepts you can make one call the other in the most convenient can create a list of strings and call any it is completely unnecessary and has only refactor your code instead in a way you need to only get benefits in doing both in short and long	
 typed languages must make all of their checks at runtime because the type might change during the course of the typed languages resolve all types during compile time so the cost is consumed up one is the main reason why dynamic typed languages are typically but there are other things to think a lot depends on the compiler or the gc the dispatch table layout and lookup algorithms along with other all depends on the a dynamic typed language can be faster than a compiled language it just takes more work to accomplish

 typically implement the first it seems to be what the design guidelines the reason immediately but i consider it a good one any implementer of the class should have the same sort of protection against the case where the object is disposed as general in other best not to that whoever is implementing a derived class knows precisely when they can call a certain whose successful execution may or may not depend on whether the object has already been disposed or not ideally this should be documented via xml comments your second i would again stick with the recommended practice of passing especially since used in the core even if you think alternative methods are more i think best to stick to the method used in the framework for the sake of as with all clearly up to you how you want to implement a certain design though unless you have a particularly good reason highly advisable just to stick with in both these it probably do a great deal of harm to utilise some of the alternatives you suggested in your so long as they are used consistently and preferably documented to the

 unclear what problem trying to you can definitely obtain a hash for an entire image and use that as a key in a trie although i think in this case the trie structure would give you almost no performance benefit over a regular hash because you are performing a hash every time you do a you are implementing something where you want to compare two images or find similar images in the tree you might consider using the gif or jpeg header of the image as the beginning of the this would cause images with similar index to be grouped near each other within the trie you could then compute a hash for the image only if there was a collision multiple images in the trie with the exact same

 understand that it is more secure you use different but take my word for not a i even play one on reason i it to be more secure is that using extra information for encoding multiple keys and an unknown number of keys you publish the fact that encryption using the same key makes many codes easier to heard this for some codes but i it to be true for rot13 think the security scheme used by kerberos is a better one than simple double actually have one master key whose sole purpose is to encrypt the session key and the master key is used the session key is used to encrypt the real traffic and it has a limited this has two dudes have time to crack the session key by the time managed to do those session keys are no longer in same evil dudes get an opportunity to crack the master key simply because so rarely used would need a great many encrypted packets to crack the as i take that with a big grain of i work for the but then have to tell you that even if i did work for the you crack me that my kerberos depending on your is the mythological dog that guards the gates of a mascot for that security that same dog is called fluffy in the harry potter world once had a girlfriend whose massive german shepherd dog was called a similarly misnamed

 used git to stitch together my own github hosted project and an external ui library that i wanted to the library is hosted in a subversion repository on used and and it worked reasonably the downsides order to keep up to date with the library i had to perform a new commit to update the submodule git hash this is because git unlike are pinned to a particular commit this may not be an actual downside if you actually want to pin a stable i was working with code that was initial pull of a git repo with submodules requires an additional step with submodule this is not an issue for but for others using your code they will have to remember or be told to perform this step before your you use the command line it is easy to screw up your repository with this is because you type add to complete to add but it to add note the trailing if you execute the command with the trailing then it blitzes the submodule and adds all its contained files this is mitigated by using add or just training yourself to delete the slash happened to me enough times that i trained myself to remove commits can mess up git rebase i forget the exact but it is especially bad if you have a submodule and you run a normally with a dirty tree you but submodules are not having several submodule commits in a rebase group also causes the last submodule hash gets committed to the first pick on your and this is pretty tricky to fix this can be worked around with a more careful workflow carefully deciding when to do your submodule but can be a steps to set this up were something along the lines svn clone that as a git project to in your own git run submodule submodule add that out to your own repo this is more or you will have a new directory which in your case would be the geomapping time you need to update the geomapping you would run something svn svn push this updates the git mirror of the add subproject careful with the trailing commit push this pushes the commit that updates the not seen to many tutorials on a git submodule work so i hope this helps you

 used it to write thin layers of integration between managed and native all best known unique feature of it is the ability to seamlessly delve into unmanaged code and modify accidentally any bit of writeable memory in the entire process not an advantage in general but when you need but i think going to need it less and you can compile with a but then it really becomes a completely new are two other big unique features that do something in a destructor is a in it is a proper this means that has the most complete infrastructure for working with only helps clients the but only helps implementors as hopeful that perhaps one day will absorb this which can be used along with cli another thing that would be very useful in although it could be made a lot more seamlessly without the historical is good enough without the last two things that not tempted to use	
 used jboss in a past a forward chaining rules based on but you need to be careful about when you load rules into working memory and when you fire them there is obviously a performance overhead the biggest issue you will run into is in terms of building the rules especially if you need to provide customers with an interface to build the building them programatically or reading in declarative based rules is fairly are also some other frameworks you should consider as just to the rules engines above are very java and not sure whether possible to use them from other languages is an open source implementation of drools called this discussion thread

 using the zend framework and the openid selector from however i find i login using sites like google and yahoo as they use direct identity based login system whereby one is just redirected to a url as opposed to entering a unique url of their own for checked out many options and hacks but none of them seem to how can i get this to work here btw how is it implemented at stack i could really use all the help here the issue here is that from what i have noticed is that the zend openid class support openid the thing is that a typical open id providor gives you a unique url such as or and the zend openid class just parses through that url and then redirects you to the providor website where upon authentication you are redirected the case of yahoo and google you enter a unique url instead you are redirected to the providors login site and upon login and authentication you are redirected back so basically whats happeining is that the object when it parses to tell who the providor is it fails to tell from the general url like when you click on teh google link it redirects you to more an issue with the zend openid object here and there any help on zend related forums so i was wondering if someone had already hacked or had an alteration i could make to the class to accomplish sorry if missing something but kinda new to this and programming with open id and have just started to get my feet for the follow up i did check into rpx a while back and they do have a php class but i wasnt able to check it out plus i really just want to for now get the code selector used as on stackoverflow to work with yahoo and google there has to be some kind of way to tweak the parsing which the zend openid class uses as it runs a series of regular expression checks to make a do i implement direct identity based openid authentication with zend

 was talking about this with someone here the other as we use stored procedures for all database access we were discussing linq in and the linq to sql iqueryable she quickly realized that using linq with sprocs would be redundant at best and difficult at advantages of linq to sql are that the code lives in one and what is occurring in the db is very in addition the development time can be depending mostly on as there is one less work product to advantages of as i see are also stored procedures allow for much better access control for a as they can inspect the sproc before and allow the application use access only to execute that sproc rather than access to all the tables this makes for much better reviews of database contention and performance the other advantage i see is that while linq to sql will generate a correct in the case of complex queries there are times where you hit a case that causes poor optimization on the db in those cases you would either rewrite the or provide hints to the both are breaking with the dba in a but have but i feel really nervous when working on a large high transaction load db and not knowing every possible statement that would be executed by a so sticking with sprocs

 was thinking about some stuff lately and i was wondering what would be the right way to do something like the following scenario sure it is a quite common thing for db guys to do something like say you have a products something like this table not null default key key default out of the ordinary now lets say that there are a hierarchy of categories in a different and there is a separate table which binds relationships with products table so that each product belongs to some kind of a category omit because thats not the issue comes the interesting part what if each of the categories mandates additional set of variables to the product for example products in the computer monitors category must have enum screen size enum and some other lets say ice creams have some other variables like flavor shelf storage time int problem herein lies in that all products have a common set of variables description and sort of like but there are additional variables which are not consistent from category to category but all products should share common because in the end they all belong to the products so one can query for example select from products order by maybe not but you get the i see severa potential generate separate table for each product category and store products there with appropriate additional variables stupid and not query product table stays the same with common and for each category create a separate table with additional variables binding two tables with a join but query performance and clarity issues how would one filter down products from category table and additional filter for extra variable lcd monitors it would require sql join products table stays the same and add another variable type text that holds for example json data that hold additional variables compact and but filter through variables with know missing something quite obvious and simple here a bit rusty on the normalization techniques been searching around stackoverflow before asking this question without after posted the question i have clicked on one of my tags and found several similar questions which resulted in to look up specialization relational point of the story is that this must be the first occurrence in my internet life that tags are actually useful in i would still like to hear from you guys and your the problem with approach is that i expect somewhere around there is a hierarchy level of categories and end nodes add specialized variables they accumulate in the order of so it would be a bit unpractical to add specialized tables to join due to the vast number of attribute volatility in my case attribute that was suggested looks like the way to here comes query thanks would you model data variables variance on common

 was working on making modifications to for a there is very little information on how the magento system is there are hundreds of folders and and there are at least a thousand view there was little support available from magento and i suspect the main reason for this lack of information is because the creators of magento want you to pay them to become a certified magento at that time last year there was no stackoverflow first task was to figure out how the database schema worked and which table stored some attributes i was looking there are over 300 tables in and i find out how the sql queries were being so i had just one exported the entire database and at least lines of sql into a file using and i this file into the subversion i made some changes to the database using the magento administration and redownloaded the i ran a diff using and scrolled through the lines file to find which lines had as crazy as it it did and i was able to figure out which tables i needed to 2nd problem because of the crazy directory i had to ftp to about 3 folders at the same time for trivial so i had to keep 3 windows of my ftp program switch between them and ftp each 3rd problem was figuring out how the url mapping worked and where some of the code i wanted was being by sheer i managed to find the model class i was looking by sheer luck and other similar crazy adventures i managed to work my way through and complete the since stackoverflow was started and by a helpful answer to bounty i was able to finally get enough information about magento that i can do future projects in a less crazy manner

 way dunit normally works is you write some published and dunit runs them as what i want to do is a little i want to create tests at run time based on trying to test a particular module that processes input files to creates output i have a set of test input files with corresponding known good output the idea is to dynamically create one for each input that process the inputs and check the outputs against the known good actual source of data here however the difficulty is making dunit behave in a for the sake of this suppose that the data source were just a random number here is an example concrete problem that gets to the heart of the some test objects or at say 10 of where each named at run time from a randomly generated i mean the name of the test that appears in the or fails based on a random pass for fail for the design of it like it was designed with enough flexibility in mind to make such things not sure that it is i tried to create my own test class by inheriting from tabstracttest and but some crucial methods i also tried inheriting from but that class is closely tied to the idea of running published methods the tests are named after the so i just have a single one because then all my tests would be called and i want all my tests to be individually is there some alternative to dunit that could do what i dunit	
 way i can think of is to loop through table one and search for similar rows in table this is how you can do through the table to find if there are rows with same payid and empid in table the method returns more than 0 then disable the from you can also think about a method which can give you intersection of two if these two columns are priamry then this will if then you will need to tweak the code as per your	
 way i handle it is to have an installed into program files next to the main on app i have the app download an xml file off of the web and save it in the app data this file contains the latest versions of the dlls and has a simple version through the list of filenames and if you have the dll locally or you have an older then add the needed dll to an update you generate your update fire off the with a command line list of the files to be you have to write them to program files but i on my updater pops up the uac prompt correctly it should to maintain program updater then downloads the files to program files and restarts the main problem with firing off the second app is that you have to give it a manifest with set in hard to but once the updater is done and retriggers the main it cannot start the main app with normal an exe running as administrator can only start other as administrator even if is set in the i know why you restrict it back to normal can only elevate permissions for some	
 way i solved this problem was to place the image within a border with cliptobounds property set to the rendertransformorigin on the image is then set to so the image will start zooming on the center of the the rendertransform is also set to a transformgroup containing a scaletransform and a then handled the mousewheel event on the image to implement void mousewheeleventargs var st double zoom 0 handle the panning the first thing i did was to handle the mouseleftbuttondown event on the to capture the mouse and to record i also store the current value of the this what is updated to implement void mousebuttoneventargs var tt tr is start origin new i handled the mousemove event to update the void mouseeventargs if var tt tr is vector v start forget to release the mouse void mousebuttoneventargs for the selection handles for resizing this can be accomplished using an check out for more

 way to try at way to do screen scraping in a much more structured way is to use or yahoo query it will return the scraped data structured as json or scrap from html where give you a json chose like this overflow works best with javascript beauty of this is that you can do and clauses which ultimately gets you the scraped data structured and the what you need less bandwidth over the wire from html where get you is any windows simulator available to test iphone as a hobbyist who cannot afford a i set up a toolchain kit locally on cygwin to compile objecti simulator port for windows have a button control need another web page to be redirected while clicking that button how to do that thanks to redirect the web page in flex application to get only the questions we do a title from html where the in projections want the function to be entered simultaneously by multiple neither do i want it to be entered again when it has not returned is there any approach to achieve certain doing something really obviously but been trying to figure it out for a few hours now and nothing is jumping out at using a modelform so i can i am going through my project in ie only its showing errors a runtime error has occurred do you wish to line 768 is this is regarding any script er have a java batch file consisting of 4 execution steps written for analyzing any java in one of the adding few libs in classpath that are needed for my co you write your query it generates a url for you our ultimately you end up doing something like this titlelist play with

 we generate classes in by returning all the sprocs from all of our databases and adding the correct parameter types and names to a object and then returning it in one giant this means we can do things like when we want to pass parameters to a for a stored procedure without having to add the parameters with their relative data types every single time we make a it also means that we have to look up the exposed parameters for each sproc because they are merely put it into for every parameter you want to deal with in a sproc have to do this is undesirable as mean an application would explode into gazillions of lines of code to achieve really quite simple looking into refactoring this in such a way where we can do something like instead by making it strongly unfortunately this means our folder will be twice the size it already is because such a large quantity of code would be written a short example of what i class dim cmd as public sub uses the configurationmanager to get the connection string for a certain dim cmd as new end public sub param as end public sub param as end public sub param as end public function as return end end there alternatives to having to do this that we are unaware sure this is a common problem amongst many businesses developing typed stored procedure resolution in

 we have this album one artist can have many and one album can have many this all 3 entities have basically the same foreign of the relationship to the corresponding children to album and album to typical solution to the provided solution would be three with the same fields albumid and foreign key constraints in the relationship can we in this incorporate a form of inheritance to avoid the repetition of the same field talking something of the this table would hold 3 entities this table will hold the name of the entity the name of an artist for the field of and entitytypeid holding 1 for 2 for album and so do you think about the above does it make sense to incorporate in this db would you prefer having the constraints of the first scenario or the more generic the risk of linking an artist with a track for since there is no check to see the inputter value is really of an come to think of i think you can actually check if an inputted value of the relfield of an artist corresponds to an with triggers favor abstraction or

 we send a packet from a udp port we receive an exception if the network returns an icmp host the exception tell us anything useful the contents of the icmp just listen for icmp and that will give us the info we while ignoring the exception on the udp open a raw listen for icmp packets and go from fine in development but in production on server 2008 it appears the security context the exe is running in must have admin rights to be able to open a raw this is useless for a if i understand what microsoft are saying then the only way we can do what we want is run our service under an account with admin feels a bit like sledgehammer for a peanut not to mention a potential security hole that goes with having a network facing service running under an admin really hope i am wrong here but i seem to find anything that contradicts the got any comments hints or an icmp packet in the context of a service on

 what a comment from another newcomer to iphone background i was a c programmer about 15 years ago and since then moved around technologies quite a bit now an adobe flex developer in my day by trying to transform myself into an iphone developer i bought a book on iphone sdk development in i also bought in i thought be set with these two but after a couple of days reading and working through exercises it was clear i was hopelessly i bought another book this sdk from the pragmatic bookstore this is a work in progress book but looked for turns out this book took me further a great piece of work the early chapters were paced nicely and i was able to follow along and then all of a sudden they began to assume i could recall perfectly the lessons learnt and the procedures followed in earlier chapters and i began yet again to flounder a little the worst thing i find when trying to learn something from a book is to have to jump around from place to place constantly to make any sense of what meant to be i but bear with i bought another iphone from now this book assumes for a beginner to iphone this book hits the no jumping around necessary and finally i found i was what finding is that all three books in conjunction with one another really seem to provide me with a more complete picture collectively i have a great set of tutorial and reference the book not touched on so much yet but i expect that to be what i need it to be a reference manual for the not need that until much deeper in to the slowly emerging from that horrible at the deep end and i swim very feeling to one where i can at least tread hopefully with a bit more paddling be able to touch the bottom certainly my confidence is returning to address the original question personally if i did this all over i think i would have gained anything by starting out building for the mac first and then to the i would definitely have lost less hair had i bought the apress book first that for me was the book that made complete sense of everything for i think then the sdk pragmatic book was the best this is the path suggested to a colleague and confident a good this

 work in recently ran a software development procurement process and selected three vendors to work on an agile some were already sure we wanted to run an agile project because we knew our requirements were ambiguous and because it was a web project with a significant design so say that it helps a lot if your client knows about agile and buys in from the even if they actually practice it note that acceptance of agile is growing in government so this may get safeguard we used was to contract a very experienced scrum master to work for us and handle the software project management duties on behalf of our team lead architect usability we spent a lot of time finding this and selected them from three great this was costly but worth we had selected our vendors and broadly agreed their roles we put together a quick mou outlining our intention to the likely budget of the the likely size of the team from each a commitment to have a full contract signed by the end of the and a time materials agreement in the we jumped in with a technical planning sizing session and got that side of things no dev work or design was done in this but we did a lot of sizing and the end of the month we put together contracts for each vendor was but that was one vendor put forward sample contracts that we might one based on payment by thirds of the the other on completion of i think in the end we did completion of sprints using some of the language in the payments section of our standard contract we were okay with this approach acknowledging some because we think there was a huge amount of actual technical risk in the project and because we had a lot of confidence in the procurement process and in the vendors we had the end this was a very successful and we have since started using scrum for other i think having a great team was we were confident in the vendors not only that they could do the but that they were a good fit in terms of their attitude to working as one and in terms of there being roles for each they would not be competing for the same our vendors had not been so we would have had a few more reservations about entering into a contract like but running procurement is almost as much an art as a and we knew we had chosen the team with the best fit an attitude from a pool of other have since rolled over all three contracts for a second year of though say it s not going quite as smoothly this time scrum different team it is still a great project to be involved may also find this

 work on a web application product which allows mnemonics an underscore below the character to allow a keyboard combination and the key c to trigger the are created by different developers and they can each statically set mnemonics for can be so it is not necessarily known at design time the exact mnemonics which will be required for one can be at most one mnemonic using any character on a page containing many the the forms must be able to be localised into any meaning that the for close may not even appear in word used for ideal solution would be some algorithm where developers have to manually specify a instead they would be worked out at they would be and they would be both convenient and consistent did say the solution i was are there any good strategies for achieving something anywhere near the ideal to not talking about keyboard such as for which is hidden on a the mnemonics are only used for actions which are presented on the under button labels for not hidden keyboard shortcuts that would change on localisation are none we run in a web so the only accelerators are those which are part of whichever browser is being problem with attempting to choose the mnemonics at design time is that the people responsible for developing the ui are not aware of the as it could be done months the problem of using nested and modular forms means that even without the there could still be of the ideas batted around include having a global mnemonic registry which forms could use to apply for a certain mnemonic based on localised the registry would then calculate which was the best use of available somehow it would have to maintain the state of that such that the same form does not appear with different mnemonic sets over the course of the application it could possibly even be done statically and if i was looking to do something like that it would fit a more general algorithm i just have no idea which there any for dealing with localisable

 work primarily as a c because the application is with a fairly long history originally developed in the early the application suite originally was developed for unix based graphical my previous job was a similar a mature distributed application that was developed on multiple unix originally in the early and due to the source code size and it would be difficult to justify simply throwing that code base away to move to a new development language or even migrating to would imagine there are still a number of larger for internal not sold as a applications written in c that are still being not entirely unlike the massive cobol applications that large companies that are also still being development in others have already mentioned the embedded systems where the development is often for software put into rom or flash memory where it is referred to as for atmel where object code ram and performance matters so the usage of a programming language with fewer or generic abstractions or assumptions is critical thing about good to great c is that they are expected if not required to know more about data structures and priority binary and should be at least vaguely this is because the c language lacks the and other standard libraries available in other this is at least partly because most implementations are to lack of templates or dynamic typing or similar to have generic enough routines to be useful in more than one programming language is not a bad even if you feel comfortable enough to claim to be comptent enough to program in the additional langages a scripting or web development language might be a good and ruby are good potential programming functional languages like objective and scala are good candidates for making you admittedly prolog is actually a declarative logic programming but it is still programming experience	
 work primarily in the world and the standard model there is for developers to work in a user account with the ability or to escalate to admin privileges not sure what the equivalent windows arrangement would but this in my the ideal the one having admin rights available on demand gives the developer full power over his workstation when the windows software has a long history of assuming that all users have admin to the point that many programs run for a many of security issues stem directly from this implicit requirement in order to be able to reliably use the all users must be must and the most effective way to ensure that your software will run for users is for your developers to be running it themselves as

 workflow sounds reasonable to got alice and bob each with their own repos on and each presumably pulling down from there to a localmachine to develop when they finish something they want to they can just push it to their repo on where visible to the other one thing i think you left out is repo owned by quinn in when alice bob decide something is production they push over to quinn then takes that and runs it through his rigorous set of tests and such and eventually if it passes he pushes out a new quinn could be some kind of continuous integration robot like hudson or cruisecontrol or somesuch that does the autobuild and testing this be it owned by quinn or a is also likely the place that alice and bob sync their repos with pulls the set of code that everyone develops workflow you outlined is as far as it i hope this answer

 working on a flash project right now and i am having to force a designer into using our source control repository to help manage and track the been a bit of an uphill battle to fully get him to embrace the benefits of source but coming had to use source control for a flash project before other than on projects where i was the only person working on starting to discover there are some addition workflow pieces you need to implement around it so you have a nightmare fighting binary mostly working on the place all the actionscript files into external files so i can work on them while the designer works on the fla file with all the this seems to be working out but when i need to change instance names and the i have to make sure i communicate well so we run into any was wondering how other people handle flash in source control and how they manage the workflow so a developer and designer can be working on the project at the same source control best

 working on a moderately complex flat file schema and had a curve ball thrown at what the input looks dressmaking dressmaking dressmaking dressmaking pizza pizza home depot home depot so the output that the client wants is the header line called prqt for each number and a line for each of the transactions so for we would have 1 prqt line and 4 prln which are the transaction so it would look like something so my main problem is how to insert only one prqt record for the looking at logical functoids to see if there is one that can look up to see if an existing value has been created for the output my primary key is the smit6321 name last four digits of the card so basically if i was coding this in i would create an array of previously inserted prqt keys and during my i would perform a look up on this when i came across to see if already created a if i had already i would skip so i create a duplicate prqt note that records are created chronologically in the source so the above records will likely be jumbled up and not sequential like the sample anyone point me in the right what functoids should i can biztalk mapper handle this sort of sure it i just need to figure it mapping ideas

 working on a project where a bunch of software is being ported to a new hardware a certain percentage of the software modules should be subjectively similar on the new hardware code review for some of these modules has shown that the port done is been done with a minimal effort or insight the developers doing the work are as often happens with however it has also shown that the design of the software is lacking either handles error conditions badly or just has a bunch of have asked that instead of reviewing code after the port has been we review the design i am told that this might not be a good use of probably because the existing documented designs are not up to i barking up the wrong is a design process inherently is there a way to avoid getting bogged down in the full design or is hands on code always the best way to sort things out even with inexperienced for the answers so yes the will be used in many future also i mention that the code is going to be too a single threaded this alone maybe good enough to indicate the i would like to proactively see if a process of design review can be put into distrustful of just hoping to fix something up when it stops working if something is found in testing to be fundamentally broken rather not redesign come defect fixing the process of design	
 working on a rather large classic asp sql server new version was rolled out a few months ago with a lot of new and i must have a very nasty bug somewhere some very basic pages randomly take a very long time to few clues the database when i run the query it detect any long running i launch iis diagnostic reqviewer shows that the request is in state can happen on any reproduce it completely have an idea of very long this morning i had a page take more than 5 minutes to when it normaly should be returned to the client in less than 100 application can handle rather large upload and download of files to 2 gb in this is also handled with a classic asp using softartisan think it can cause the problem had these uploads for quite a while had the problem on two separate servers two separate with different sets of one is running the application with good sql server 2000 and the other runs sql server the web server is iis 6 in both idea what the problem is or on how to solve that kind of problem problem came from memory some asp pages were used to download files from the file sizes could go from a few kb to more than 2 these variations in size induced memory the asp pages could also take quite some time to execute time for the user to download the pages minus what is put in cache at which is not really standard for server pages that should execute is what i did to improve things all the download logic in a single asp page with session turned allowed me to put that asp page in a specific pool that could be recycled every so often would now disturb the rest of the application no on lfh fragmention which is not by default on windows in order to reduce memory for lfh is a dll there that you can use to turn on but the article is in have to learn our beautiful language can i find why some classic asp pages randomly take a real long time to

 working on a web application that is the development process is agile with several sprints already our globalization framework is good and localization efforts have been successful so we continue to run into questions during requirements particularly in data storage and validation certain the questions we are wrestling with have been researched and solved many times and the answers are likely well known and documented so i have been unable to find the compendium of information looking are some sample questions like to find answers are the best practices for storage and display of address information for a global of characters to store for address fields you know there is a city name that contains 163 of address are the best practices for storage and display of phone numbers for a global question for a our approach to these issues has been to allow ample storage for the various fields and to perform minimal input relying on the user to get it this approach is working ok at this stage in the but the various project stakeholders are not satisfied using this approach for the long there is a strong desire for clean efficient storage and attractive data presentation for all recommendations out there for papers or websites that have a fairly complete handling of these and related globalization

 working with the wpf datagrid from the wpftoolkit and having issues with trying to zoom the entire my initial thought was that it was going to be really easy and i would just apply a scale transform to the grid and animate the scaley properties when the used clicked a this did not work however because the scrollbar was zoomed in making it i need fixed headers and fixed columns on the datagrid so i simple use a scrollviewer outside of the datagrid to handle the the second thing i tried was to just scale the font size in the but this failed because on shrinking the font size the columns stay at the original width and do not i thought i had it working by using the below code which goes into the view tree for the datagrid and adds a scale transform to the scroll content not shown in this i apply a transform to the visual tree item for the headers in the same manner so that it scales as i thought this was working great until i tested out the horizontal scrolling after scrolling works before zooming at all the horizontal scrolling is but after when i scroll horzonitally the display freaks it is hard to tell exactly what it is but it sort of looks like the content that is scrolling off the left of the screen is and coming back in on the maybe it is just all smashing up on the left does anyone have any ideas how i can get this hopefully without throwing out my whole datagrid that is already working quite well scrollcontentpresenter sp st new a new new datagrid zoom

 would add that one of the key reasons for having exceptions is to enable your application to handle errors at the most appropriate level in the code to do something sensible with exceptions provide a clean way to pass information back up the call stack to enable on what layer to handle various exceptions is a key decision in your application the type of application your are developing will affect the when developing a web or desktop it may be totally acceptable to handle the majority of exception types at a very high level this technique can save a lot of code when your application really cannot do much about the error and just needs to tell someone and log in a mission server you are likely to need fine grained control over exceptions in order to deal with them appropriately and keep the threads spinning no matter

 would argue that oop suits those who think in where an object consists of data as well as the functions that operate on that you tend to think of functions and the data they operate on as separate then you are a procedural you tend to think of functions and the data they operate on as being then you are an caution against going out and learning about in order to do programming you need to teach yourself to like an need to get to the point where you understand and can name the benefits vs and will help you to be a better programmer only in the sense that the more styles of programming a programmer the more range in his repertoire for solving problems and writing elegant you cannot go off and write all your code and automatically have good but if you really understand how oop and not just some popular design patterns of the then you can write some pretty good especially when writing a large

 would certainly ever checking in i would absolutely ban it is appropriate to check code into source saying do is too think we all agree with these check dead code into source check broken code into source at least to trunk and only very rarely to a private you have temporarily commented something out or broken something for debugging check the code in until you restore the code to its correct of are saying there are other such as removed or an incremental but incomplete improvement that includes a small amount of code as documentation of what comes or a 1 snippet of commented out code showing something that should be code should always be accompanied by a comment that says why it is commented out not just and gives the expected lifetime of the for following code does more harm than so is commented but needs to be replaced before release comment like the above is appropriate if you are delivering a hotfix to stop a bleeding and you have the immediate opportunity to find the ultimate after delivering the the code is a reminder that you still have something that needs do i check in one example is when i am tentatively removing something that i think a high probability will have to be in the near in some the code is there to serve as a direct reminder that this is the old version is in source control and you could just use a comment as a flag that something more is sometimes not code is the better when a bug is fixed by removing one line more two of sometimes just comment out the line with a comment to that code with a reason this sort of comment is and m only check in complete the task is too large break it into smaller completable this is the sometimes neither option is achievable when you are working on production code and have an critical problem to sometimes to complete a you need to put a version of code in the field for a this is especially true for data gathering code changes when trying to find the root cause of a the specific instance being asked about in the more general question as long as the developer is checking code into a private branch that will see but that developer perhaps someone the developer is collaborating it does little but that developer should never deliver such code into trunk or an trunk should always build and should always delivering unfinished code to trunk is almost always a very bad if you let a developer check unfinished or temporary code into a private then you have to rely on the developer to not forget to scrub the code before delivering into clarify in response to comments to other if code is commented out and checked my expectation that the code will function if uncommented drops with the length of time the code has been commented refactoring tools will not always include comments in their almost if i put code into the code is there to serve as a refined something more specific than that something needs to be done it is not something that should have a long if you can find code in every source then something is delivering code into trunk for reason should be a rare if this occurs then it becomes clutter and loses its

 would consider what everyone else uses not the folks on this but the folks who write the same kind of massively or super find they all write their code in just for this fact alone regardless of any speed issues between the i would go with the tools they use and have developed will be of much more use to you if writing in the same from found apps to have somewhat less than optimal performance in some multithreading is will try to keep you safe from thread problems a good thing in most but this will cause your specific case problems try writing a simple loop that accesses a shared object using lots of run that on a single core pc and you get better performance than if you run it on a multiple core box is adding its own locks to make sure you muck it used the static lock on took on my old on my superfast the lock version is even try it next point is that with c you tend to access memory and data directly nothing gets in the with you will use some of the many classes that are these will be good in the general but after the most efficient way to access this for your case is a big deal with of those classes were not designed with those datasets in they were designed for the common cases everyone else so you would be safer using c for this never get the gc getting clogged up by a class that creates new strings internally when you read a couple of terabytes of data if you write it in it may appear that can give you benefits over a native but i think find those benefits are only realised for the kind of applications that are commonly

 would definitely go for spring together with hibernate for persistency related advantage of using spring instead of another framework is that springs philosophy is to be usually when using a framework most probably start to depend on that framework which can be a bad issue if the application is considered to run for a longer time where you then have also to do maintenance spring uses the of basically your code can but it have call but spring will call you call call so for instance you can normal old java and you have to inherit from any big problem not the in software engineering are fight for reducing them as much as possible since they will make your life harder in maintenance later reduces among your components drammatically by managing the instantiation of components through configuration files and the i want to go the best thing is that you start reading some tutorials at the official initially it may need some time in the understanding but once you got it earn a lot of

 would look first at the why you want to do normally applications operate like there is no issue in 2 clients doing inserts at the same time besides wrong approaches in the the solution will vary with the one option is to have a microsoft message queue and move the inserts out of those so the load of the inserts is controlled by the process that reads form the i still fail to see why you want to avoid the inserts from running in parallel from what i read in the other responses i think others do i will quote 2 of your comments on reason i want this is because in the case of a power i lost only one transaction instead of the because before the there are other lengthy jobs that require only when during the insertion there is a need for sequential i read the first i would actually think a reason to want them in you want to be done with them as fast as going sequential will actually increase the time to make the so there is more time where the power surge can the it makes me think that you are probably more concerned in the effect of these processes running on parallel and the insert not getting into the this again means you want to be done with the inserts so not a reason to do them you might have a case for a distributed transaction that also includes the file system was looking at the file system but i recall if they ever did something on the newer distributed transactions are kind of a pain to set up though and access to the ports it good path i have is adding more info to the process to be able to tell where it you might not even code an automatic recovery process but at least you know you will have the info for sure to know something went simplest way is an insert at the beginning of the process and have a flag to signal when it was if it is a long running process you might want to have something more like an status you keep updating to be able to tell in which step it an alternative is writing the status to the file any case it will only tell you that the last step that completed not whether the current step was or not able to be this is what makes the retry logic a bit more as you just continue where it you have to check whether the last step was or not and that depends on each if the above is the it is hard to tell from the you might want to open a different question about long running processes automatic

 would presume that the answer lies in prefetching the associations that you want that way you can fetch the needed part of your object graph in a single you would do this in criteria queries like query results will give you back a list of cats with both the mate and the kittens you can then navigate to these properties without incurring an if you need a more flattened result do it using perhaps like results new mate offspr will give you back a flattened list of anonymous types with the given this will work if all you need is prefetching the object however if you need to prefetch things such as counts or sums then you will need to examine the projections and alias parts of criteria more if you are trying to exactly duplicate your above you can do so like query will return you basically the same as your hql however instead of using an indexed list it will use a dictionary that maps the alias to the	
 would probably be slightly easier in wpf because of the thumb control which provides easy to use support for i remember in winforms you would need to handle the mouse events whereas the wpf thumb does this for you and translates them into drag delta and end if you are much more familiar with one framework than the other than that would probably dwarf the difference that the thumb control would should also have a look around for that could handle this for you i think they exist for both winforms and wpf sure

 would really only make sense when you have a model hierarchy where the view is showing the common properties of the various child this could work but as a practical matter i see this happen very in my code the only place that i approach something like this is with a contact i have a user model that has a self contact and an emergency both contacts are of the same type with the differentiator being whether the relationship is or something i have a single view for creating these contacts and that view is rendered by 2 different actions on the same controller createcontactinformation and even this both use the same model i could have chosen to subclass the but there really enough of a distinction to warrant that the general case i would say that a view is used by a single controller and each controller deals with a single primary ancillary models to the primary may be handled by the primary controller or have their own depending on how you want to structure the

 would start by collecting some performance metrics on the build on whatever system you currently use to i would specifically look at cpu and memory the amount of data read and written from and the amount of network traffic on windows you can use perfmon to get all of this on you can use tools like iostat and figure out where the bottlenecks are is your build cpu disk starved for the answers to these questions will guide your purchase decision if your build hammers the cpu but generates relatively little putting in a screaming raid disk is a waste of may want to try running your build with varying levels of parallelism as you collect these metrics as if using run your build with and this will help you see if the build is cpu or disk consider the possibility that the right build server for your needs might actually be a cluster of cheap systems rather than a single massive box there are lots of distributed build systems out there that can help you leverage an array of cheap computers better than you could a single big

 would there be a performance they perform the same functionality as c the only difference is that they catch more errors at and easier to search for in your source is exactly equivalent to and will generate exactly the same a f is exactly equivalent to and will generate exactly the same so the only cast that differs is can throw an but that is because it does things that the cast cannot so use unless you need its is usually safe to assume that compiler writers are given two different expressions that have the same semantics according to the it is usually safe to assume that they will be implemented identically in the the second example should be not of fixed it just to make it absolutely here is what the standard conversions performed by followed by a followed by a be performed using the notation of explicit type the same semantic restrictions behaviors if a conversion be interpreted in more than one of ways listed the that appears first in the list even if a cast resulting that interpretation is if since the cast is implemented in terms of the casts should be course they because the compiler generates the same code in any but more plausible than the casts being

 you and cast from base class to derived assuming you want to have the child object the parent so the relationship as it you will have only one hardware the specific childa and childb create a new inheritance so that you have an ispecifichardwaretasks interface or base and two derived classes hardware is constructing and it gets to the point where it knows what type of hardware working it then creates an instance of specifica or this instance is private to exposes methods which wrap the ispecifichardwaretasks methods can even implement that interface if that makes specific classes can take a reference to the hardware if necessary i know if you have access to the this pointer in a my delphi is getting these ramblings helped	
 you are a fortran programmer you have probably seen a subroutine accepting if you think about insane are too you run the risk of swapping and you quickly realize that some arguments always travel would make sense to pack them under a single entity that carries everything around as a non as independent this would reduce the number of arguments giving you only the burden to find proper this single entity is the your you say that a bank is an aggregate of those you can now declare a concrete variable of that which will represent and provide access to the single variables acchecks and so in order to do you have to use the so if your bank variable is called you can say for can imagine b as a containing different you move the all the shelves and their content move array is a group of entities of the same type or or and they are one after another so you can access each of them with a numeric remember unless specified arrays indexes in fortran start at 1 all the other major the first index is zero for your i suggest you integer is the but you write please also note that there is a difference between using the and the if you want to define a matrix which is a you have to use the what you wrote is the better if you write character this you write but your syntax is deprecated could be remember that better if you write one member variable per line in the a matter of but i prefer to see the full size of a type by having one line per member maxrows and i would write them as and parameters and stuff that is highly constant by tradition is identified with an all underscore separated name in any major to answer your here is an example of the use of an more integer myarray 0 equivalent to zeroing the single elements one by print g95 0 5 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 array is just like multiple variables with the same identified by an very useful to express or can of course do an array of an aggregated type you instead of a predefined type

 you are starting to work with perl and have never done so this module will save you tons of time and for almost every basic error message you can this module will give you a lengthy explanation as to why your code is including some helpful hints as to how to fix for you this helpful symbol requires explicit package name at line of aborted due to compilation errors said strict which indicates that all must either be lexically scoped declared beforehand or explicitly qualified to say which package the global is in exception from user global symbol requires explicit package name at line of aborted due to compilation at line myname print some error get this helpful chunk of error at line near of aborted due to compilation errors probably means you had a syntax common reasons a keyword is a semicolon is a comma is an opening or closing parenthesis is an opening or closing brace is a closing quote is there will be another error message associated with the giving more it helps to turn on error message itself often tells you where it was in the line decided to give sometimes the actual error is several because perl is good at understanding random the line number may be and once in a blue only way to figure out triggering the error is to chopping away half the program each time to the error went sort of the cybernetic version of exception from user syntax error at line near of aborted due to compilation line there you can go about deducing what might be wrong with your program this print is formatted entirely a large number of known errors with while this would not be a good thing to use in it can serve as a great learning aid for those who are new to

 you are truly doing there is no practical difference between a class and a struct except the default member visibility classes have private visibility by default while structs have public visibility by the following are unsigned int unsigned int unsigned int unsigned int point you need the you can simply initialize the struct object with a unsigned long unsigned char long length default constructor replaces unsigned destructor to avoid memory delete few things to in use new instead of taken some liberty and changed bitlength to if this class represents a network be much better off dealing with bytes instead of bits my the data array is an array of unsigned not unsigned this is based on my assumption that this class represents a network the constructor allows you to create a packet like default packet with data packet with data destructor is called automatically when the packet instance goes out of scope and prevents a memory

 you are using mvc is somewhat you basically have three options for this type of ui mechanic on a web the data in your lists is relatively small and infrequently it can be easiest just to all possible data on the page in the initial request either in something like a javascript array or hidden elements in the page when the value of box a javascript just replaces the contents of box b with the appropriate this all happens without any requests back to the server which makes it very but this method breaks down when the size of your data impacts the response time of the initial page the data in your lists is large or frequently changing the time frame a user would be on the page making a the legacy method is to just have the page get reloaded with the new query arguments when the value of box a code on the adjusts the output based on the new depending on how complex the rest of the rendering code in your page this can be is a variation on option 2 and is basically the answer gave regarding still loading the contents of box b on demand when box a the difference is that only reloading the piece of the page that has changed rather than the entire if your data is small enough to use option probably what i would go with due to its otherwise go with option particularly if already got other ajax related things implemented option 2 is seems to be considered a legacy mechanic by many people these

 you are using web control protocol will act as the queue to a certain provides delivery of a stream of bytes from program on one computer to program on another guarantees that if client sends packet then the server will received it in that then if you must reply back to the client in the same order as then you might need a default maximum worker thread is set to 12 threads per cpu so on a dual core you can run 24 connections at a depending on how long the calculation takes and what you mean by lot of you could try different simplest one is to use servicetimeouts and servicethrottling and only handle what you can and reject the ones you not an increase the second you could make the service completely implement two methods and accepts the stuff them into a queue a and returns a guid immediately like using instead of the client can use the returned guid as a claim ticket and call every few if the calculation has not finished you can return 404 for calculation must now be done by a separate process that monitors the third option is the most but the outcome is similar to that of the first option of putting cap on incoming

 you contain characters inside a string in php just about any other you need to escape those literal else use which are typically interchangeable in specification of quote types to delimit attributes sgml requires that attribute values be delimited either double quotation marks decimal or single quotation decimal single quote can be included within the value when the value is delimited double quote and vice last sentence applies to html attribute strings that contain which is not your but you do have php code with a quoted string containing and php supports the same policy about	
 you control one or edit one to change the name and recompile or equivalently see and answers which will work access to the source you control either of them you can wrap one of them that is compile library that does nothing except all the symbols of the original except the offending which is reached through a wrapper with an alternate what a since qeek says talking about dynamic the solutions suggested by and are probably seem to live in long ago days when static linkage was the it colors my the by i mean to make visible to modules linking to the to the keyword at file how this is controlled is os and linker and it is something i have to look

 you could do one of two as danish use the textchanged property of textbox1 to set the enabled property of validator2 to true or false just make sure you set the autopostback property of textbox1 to this would look even better if you wrapped it in an update panel so the user have to see the other option is to use a custom validator control where you write the validation logic in the you can check if the text entered in textbox1 is a date and then validate textbox2	
 you could have a	
 you could pass in a reference to a and copy all the cars from the former list to the is done with iterators and the fill cars with we could use here but not first argument is the position where you want to insert the could thus look like const int id keyvals that you would have to change the type of in transportation to car instead of car which is a pointer to a list of you have a namespace at the top of your file you need the in front of t

 you face frequently changing consider using a different model for your software development life an agile approach may be a better if you want some degree of structure to your then consider using a methodology like which advocates a certain degree of requirements gathering and design up but then embraces change throughout the development other approaches you might want to look at would be evolutionary or staged google any of these terms and you will find more what work for is any bduf design up methodology like

 you get the management which is basically the equivalent of a graphical query default user is you decide the password on best off using the gui to get to know the metadata tables a tree with all the triggers just and use the command the to generate the sql you would have typed to create them had you actually typed i find that powerful to learn what do do after using the wizards the gui provides to do these language is a lot like the biggest difference i found is the join syntax if you use the lose it and get with the ansi outer style its the only one sqlserver	
 you give an you can using a clause after the where clause with certain from test group by filter having same logic applies if you want to use clauses on your example you need to surround in	
 you go with for web depending on your experience with web heartily recommend starting with mvc before web web forms is the original style of building and tries to abstract a lot of the it allows you to build applications without realising happening under the hood state in my these abstractions although making things easy at first begin to when you get into more complicated scenarios tutorial on the other hand makes it easier to build web sites that are a lot to the while still keeping you if you want absolute control over the resulting html and afraid of things like form post and query string then you might enjoy mvc a lot course it would be beneficial to know but if i was starting probably start with mvc and move to forms realise how bad it is and move back	
 you go with it might actually be faster to just run the command once and get back all of the rather than running it for each of your executable there is some overhead for a and getting the you get back the have to loop through them in but this might be normally there be more than 100 processes running at so it be too you should write a test and check to see if is the best way to there really an equivalent getting a process list is pretty so the java designers must have decided not to this capability into the base java probably have to to get the results on or on	
 you got the oracle client you probably need at least the jdbc driver files from the

 you have a 3x3 array of and you want to perform a transformation on every element of i suspect you may be better served in the long run by using a numerical library like and using the matrix routines it if you are in any way interested in high then this would be a much of flexibility can be foregone at the array element level in exchange for optimised numerical algorithm

 you have a genric type parameter t you are only able to access members of instances of t that are known to exist at compile as every type derives from object you have only the members of object availiable and you want to access other members you have to constrain what t is allowed to in your situation a interface would be the way to see for could also try to use reflection or check the actual type at runtime an perform a the first is hard to impossible to do if you do not know much about the types you will and the later requires you to know possible types at compiletime and will not work in your way might be to pass a delegate to the search method that performs the actual	
 you have a good object i see the benefit of you certainly have the in since you have a relational but the is no no i think a mapping between objects and without richer object does not justify stick with jdbc or ibatis if your	
 you have a key then the client could encrypt with the public and you decrypt with the private too much work for the and not a very way of doing you are sending the user name and password as parameters then you should resort to transport which requires you to have a key combination issued to you from a trusted certificate should be noted that your association of ssl encrypted channel with an external facing site is the point of wanting to encrypt a channel is to prevent exactly like you are trying to do could use a but that would require installing the public key of the certificate on each machine that is going to call your web easier to just get one from a trusted	
 you have a meta refresh tag have seen these cause similar issues on post a link to the page and you will find getting a solution much	
 you have a nested element for example a contextmenu with can easily apply styles or templates to the contextmenu or menuitem but if the menuitem style belongs to the menu style it is quite cumbersome and redundant to add it to every menuitem there any way to apply those automatically to child so that you can simply write would be neat if foomenustyle could style containing menuitem but that does not seem to be the menu example is probably misleading since i was unaware of itemcontainerstyle and the intent was for a general based on the two answers i have come up with two one general variant and one for itemcontainerstyle and the variant for specific style attribute general variant nested elements in	
 you have a registry of the shared objects list of all active for the objects will never be as in the case of circular dependency structures kaz use as	
 you have a set of elements when the page edit maybe you have something like this with do return what if you add a new element to this table after the page has initially you click on on this new nothing will happen because the events were bound on page enter with you can bind the event above like do return if you add any new elements with a class of after the page has initially it will still register this event how is this uses what is known as event delegation to achieve this event delegation is helpful in this situation or when you want to load a large amount of say you have a div with instead of 4 you have or or you want to bind a click event to images so that x action is performed when the user clicks on doing it as you might do then bind hundreds of handlers that all do the same this is inefficient and can result in slow performance in heavy with event even if you plan on adding more images using live can be much better for this kind of as you can then bind handler to the container and check when it is clicked if the target was an and then perform an to achieve the effect without with jquery knows that new elements can be added later on or that performance is instead of binding an event to the actual it might add one to the div like in the first example pretty sure it binds them to the body but it might to the container in the example and then this property can let it check after the fact if the event that was on matches the selector that you might have make it this is helpful not only in the direct way of not having to rebind but it can be dramatically faster for a large amount of

 you possible they are trying to detect when wraps to zero goes and keep it pegged at the max value for whatever type or they may be trying to deal with a situation where is incremented in multiple threads either this is buggy they are trying to wrap to zero or one too many increments will cause the problem if they are trying to deal with being incremented not sure what problem really trying to solve or how they are trying to solve are the jon skeet it still sounds odd to me because unless offset is the latter expression may not get the latest value even worse than that even if is volatile nothing to serialize reading the new value of with another thread that may be incrementing so the very instant after the expression the value of any number of other threads may come along and increment it number of so at the expression is but using that technique can be harmful because you may end up using a value of that to the situation where using to track an array index or something given the name sounds like exactly what might be going when you atomically increment the array element at that index becomes yours to if you use the expression as in the you may suddenly be trampling on an array element that really belongs to another think of a legitimate reason to use offset i at best harmless but it could introduce hard to diagnose problems use to the comment by simon svensson that pointed to a google search for the usage in the it looks like this code usually comes from the output of a to it even uses this expression to increment local variables threading an in the cases where is a local this expression falls into the useless but mostly harmless variety will be a if the increment really more or less a very inefficient expression fact it appears to be the way the converter converts the expression to see actually this conversion is buggy for anyway because it returns the incremented value when it should return what the value was before really bad thing is that other people may look at that code and the way i need to use	
 you post a more complete hard to see how there would be that particular error with out some form of goto or flow changing most commonly see this error in code like the somecondition goto code is fundamentally the reason why is that even though s2 has a not executed if somecondition is the goto statement will jump over the initialization and at the last line of the program s2 will be uninitialized and essentially point to may also want to check out this page which gives hints on how to decipher this particular valgrind common cause for this just found is when you pass over some integer constants to a variadic which are put on the stack as but when the callee gets it as got a problem on was almost about to give up and just consider valgrind being then realised that simply casting it to long fixes my upshot take this messages

 you should lock before setting the private this will be reflected in both threads the same you may want to take some time to consider how to handle the locks and your factory is creating the object and adding it to the it will need a lock of some form around the routine to create the possible that the two threads could ask for the object at the same before it was and create 2 i recommend setting the private member directly it would be a good idea to have a single object inside of the returned class instance used just for and use some form of accessor or that locks on that synchronization object and then sets the for not that its two instances you can always just do something to check in the add a check for reference or even temporarily add a guid to your class setup at construction easy to verify that the same that

 you thought about the fact that is over 2 need 16gb of memory to store the a 64 bit let alone the objects half that on a 32bit though squeezing 8gb of pointer data into the maximum of 3gb or so usable space would be a good strongly suspect that your problem is not the number of but that the serialization framework is going into some kind of infinite loop because you have referential loops in your data this simple class public string name public children public node parent simple class be because the presence of the parent property means that serialisation will go into an infinite already implementing you are of the way to solving this you just need to ensure you remove any cycles from the object graph you are to store an object technique that is often used is to store the of a referenced object instead of the actual resolving the name back to the object on

 your filter looks like col1 and col2 and col3 then need to create an index on optimizer will use the index both to filter on the first three values and to order by the fourth you have such an then either of the following will will use an index on to filter on the but it will still have to remaining will use an index to the but all values will need to be looked upon to filter them will not use an index at so and will both be in	
 your first you could report the number of operations that succeeded provided the functions return some you could also keep a counter increases after every call in that to note what all calls succeeded and based on that counter return an appropriate error major problem with validating each and every step in a system you are probably introducing too much your second option looks like the only if you have to write a wrapper for every library function and why not add the validation if you instead of making the actual call to the said this is more	
 your goal is usually what do is implement the interface or overload the operators an ordering is or just the operator equivalence is just write one function in one location and invoke that function whenever you need to do your the same goes for comparing to objects stored in a where you put these functions depends on your application but for the comparison you can have it as part of the class	
 your html actually place the child nodes below the parent nodes in the easiest way to do this will be to loop through all the and count up for each code should do this for would be to have the child nodes defined as actually children of the parent then jquery can simplify things for if you can afford to refactor your table like you can write simpler jquery	
 your iis servers are running windows server 2003 r2 or definitely look into each server has own copy of the files which eliminates a shared network bottleneck like many others have warned deployment is as simple as copying your changes to any one of the servers in the replication group a full mesh replication takes care of the rest automatically including using remote differential compression to only send the deltas of files that have

 your last services in ddd are a place to put what i describe as if you have some type of logic or work flow that has dependencies on other entities this is the type of logic that usually inside a domain object if i have a method on my business object to perform some type of the service class might execute this method keeping the actual validation logic related to the entity inside its really good example i always mention is the funds transfer you have an account object transfer from one object to but instead you would have a service that takes the account and the then inside the service you would invoke the withdrawal method on your account and the deposit method on your if you tried to put this inside the account entity itself it would feel great podcast that talks in depth about this very topic can be found david laribee does a really good job explaining now only the but the of

 your rewriterules include several is existing file or is existing url since those are you could see a performance outside of i experienced a situation where several rewriterules start adversely effecting performance and my current implementation has a good can limit the need to iterate through all the rewriterules by just ordering them in such a way that the checks are done later on in the process that way earlier conditionals can short circuit out of your rewrite logic and save you the computation of the more expensive rules later on in the	
 your scope is limited to and not also one option would be to rethink the idea of a as an for take the following def objects published your fields def def this whenever an edit is it is visible to all but others are still free to delete one advantage of this technique is you have to have any extra logic to lock items and present a different ui to the disadvantages are extra space used in the db and the rare circumstances where a deleted item is probably just a starting if you took this likely want to do a variation on this idea depending on your use

 your solution going to have anything to do with collaboration or web content if adding sharepoint into the mix is not going to be a great wss as a developement platform instead of would require some serious justification and it is not possible to tell from your limited description of your solution why you would even contemplate all your measurement creating developement on the sharepoint platform would add coplexity and therefore cost to any developement see sharepoint document ui the lack of having to construct test a db as great those are features that we can greatly benefits of sharepoint for those items are far outweighed by the cost aspects of coding and supporting has easy solutions for these items and in a much more manageable having used both products you will want to stay with that sharepoint lists do not have any kind of relational integrity so creating anything more than a trivial relationship between lists in sharepoint will end up more expensive than creating a join statement and a few stored knowing more details of the i cannot completely rule out sharepoint as being a it is possible to use sharepoint as a developement if you do not have sharepoint experts working with you that could answer your you will not have enough sharepoint skills on your project to make it a

 your table is getting up to 1 tb in size and probably has lots of rows in i would strongly recommend not making the clustered index that much of dropping and recreating the clustered index will shuffle around all your data at least once that alone will take the big compound clustered index trying to create will significantly increase the size of all your indices they contain the whole clustered index value on each leaf for the bookmark question is why are you trying to do you just add another index with those to potentially cover your why does this have to be the clustered i see any advantage in more information on indexing and especially the clustered index see on sql server indexes very
