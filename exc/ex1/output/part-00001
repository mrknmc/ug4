 a char is really just a and all that that evalutates whether the bit the in the intx member of whatever pointer points to is not the inverts the so all the 0s become 1s and vice then the 1 i puts a single 1 in the desired combines the two values so that only the desired bit is and the whole thing evalutes to true if that bit was 0 to begin is bitwise it takes each bit in both operands and performs a logical producing a result where each bit is set if either operand had that bit 0b11000000 0b00000011 is an assignment in the same way that means means using bitwise operators can make things easier to read in some but it will usually also make your code significantly slower without strong compiler	
 a class hierarchy where the base class defines a recursive class extends can i declare another class should not be generic in because such a t could vary over the lifetime of the with a field that can hold any subclass of following does not class b to because the capture of is not sufficiently private public extends end of question noticed a tendency of a number of stackoverflow members to approach certain difficult questions with are you doing that in the first the following is a justification of my use of this pattern you can note that the java standard library also uses recursive in its definition of the enum this question could similarly be asked as to define a field of type class extends public abtract t public return asub1 extends public asub1 return asub2 extends public asub2 return to a parallel class class extends extends implements extends implements with generation of b instances managed by implementations of a bifyer bifyer of this interface may return a bsub1 or bsub2 for the this is essentially an application of the visitor pattern where the bifyer is the but unlike the standard visitor the accept method returns a value instead of this provides a modular framework where different bifyer implementations can be specified to provide alternate behavior and return types for the bify method say one for each subclass of field type for a value of a generically recursive

 a class is various static data about the class is stored in as long as a live reference to this class instance the class instance cannot be garbage believe that part of the problem has to do with whether or not the gc should remove old class instances from perm or every time you hot new class instances are added to the permgen memory and the old now are typically not by the sun jvms will not run garbage collection in but this can be enabled with optional command if you hot deploy enough you will eventually exhaust your permgen your web app does not shut down when undeployed if it leaves a thread for example then all of the class instances used by that web app will be pinned in the permgen you redeploy and now have another whole copy of all of these class instances loaded into you undeploy and the thread keeps pinning another set of class instances in you redeploy and load a whole net set of and eventually your permgen fills can sometimes fix this command arguments to a recent sun jvm to enable gc in permgen and of that a different jvm that employ a fixed sized permgen or that does gc on loaded this will help if your web app shuts down completely and leaving no live references to any of the class instances of any class loaded by the class loaders for that web this will not necessarily fix the due to class loader well as too many interned strings in some out the following links for more two bolded ones have nice diagrams to illustrate part of the the dreaded permgen unknown permgen outofmemoryerror the permanent permgen errors how to deal with out of memory

 a compiler is a little different from testing some other kinds of because ok for the compiler to produce different versions of a program as long as they all do the right if just testing an pretty much the same as any other here is a will want to build up a test each test should code you will say input to the program you will say you expect the interpreter to produce on standard say you expect the interpreter to produce on standard say care about standard error because you want to test your error will need a script that does something like the fail echo differences on diff exit brainfuck cmp fail cmp fail will find it helpful to have a script that does something run this only when totally confident that the interpreter works for that keep your test suite under source convenient to embellish your test script so you can leave out files that are expected to be time anything you all the you probably also them all nightly via a cron you want to add enough tests to get good of your source the quality of coverage tools varies but is an adequate coverage luck with your if you want to see a lovingly crafted but not very well documented testing go look at the directory for the

 a composite format string provided by the user use with and a set of types representing the arguments that would be used to format the composite format how can you check that the value is should be pretty easy to create a regular expression to check that the general syntax of the argument placeholders match per and not too much more difficult to verify that the indexes of the placeholders in the composite format string are less than the actual number of typed arguments they reference an argument that be given the types for the arguments that will be passed in are it should also be possible to validate the is appropriate for those you want to validate the user specify as a format string when the first argument type is a number yields the quantity of options by type is to want to manually check is there any other or do you just have to live with the user potentially specifying a bad format there are no custom or implementations in play just basic types already in the bonus points for addressing the custom do you validate a composite format string in against its target argument

 a long one so you might want to get that cup of been holding off on run a game called world of a turn based strategy game akin to risk or each player has a set of armies and the question revolves around the display of these currently the map is created using a background image with css positioning of team icons on top of that to represent you can see how it looks background image for the map is located and created in not designed to draw maps but hopelessly incompetent with photoshop and this works for my purposes just problem comes that i want to perform such fun things as pathfinding and for that i need to have the map somehow stored in i have tried using i have looked at incorporating it with i tried going and creating tiles as from many older games and finally i tried to use i say this so you can see clearly that not through lack of trying that i have this problem want to be able to store the map layout in code and both create an image from it and use it for things such as using python but i suspect that most answers will be the cities other such things are stored already and easily drawn i want to store the layout of the landmass and features on the for each type of terrain has a movement cost and when the map is stored as just an image i access the terrain of a given in addition to pathfinding i wish to be able to know the terrain for various things related to the cities in mountains produce stone for there a good way to do this and what terms should i have used in google because the terms i tried all came up with unrelated stuff being something completely different most of the can be placed anywhere on the map as can anywhere but in the water where drown and probably complain that chatting to somebody on msn who made me go over the really minute details and who has a better understanding of the game to the fact that played occurring to me that tiles are the way to go but not the way i had initially i put the bitmap down as it is now but also have a data layer of each tile has a given terrain type and thus pathfinding and suchlike can be done on it yet at the same time i still render using omnigraffle which works pretty will be making an editor for this as suggested by i know that graphs will be relevant but not had a chance to look into them fully really appreciate all those that answered my map from

 a major holdup to wider adoption is that the language is still so rapidly d1 a relatively conservative attempt to create a better by adding some lessons learned in the past years from languages like java and a nice but it have any huge killer so understandable that switching costs would be enough to discourage on the other is still in but represents much more significant it attempts to bridge the gap between functional and imperative with features such const reachable from a object is itself you mark a function as pure and the compiler enforces that it can have no externally visible side it use mutable state freely as long as not visible outside of the pure this implemented but the idea is to make all data unshared between threads by have the compiler automatically insert memory when needed if data is and have the type system prevent accidental also adds some features to make d more friendly to library such as return by alias this an implicit cast template alias arguments passing any symbol as an argument to a template constraints to and real message here give d d1 is a but relatively conservative most of the really impressive killer features are in but still in

 a partial answer but i think python is an excellent choice whenever anyone asks me about a good language for the one i only tutorial that springs to mind is but i think mostly geared at people with some programming a slight something you could do is just explain the how programs are sequences of instructions that the computer follows in and once your friend sees how that works you could show her how to write hello just let her perhaps you could show her the documentation so she knows how to look things but that might be a little overwhelming for a

 a rather old big and complex codebase for a program originally targeted at it turns out that some sections of this program are written in an obscure dialect of x86 assembler called lap after the company and product that produced the assembler done a fairly deep google search and unable to find either the original assembler or any information or documentation about i have found some rather frustrating pages on experts exchange of people asking similar i be able to get this thing to compile until i can either find a copy of pharlap assembler or find enough information about the dialect to translate it to a more masm like either or try to muscle through just figuring it out by reading if none of this is then i just need some help with this and i should at least be able to get one section of the program to a struct declaration in a file that looks like struct bhash struct void rgb3 int int int ulong temp var used by blackbox to us int global so assembler code can see then some assembler that looks like which is presumably trying to make the same type declaration so that some assembler code can use the same cachedata dd pointer to cache data dd contains dd error diffusion dithering dd dd dd rgb value with dithering rolled dd cache dd to use you also need dd uncomment a few lines dd search for to find dd extern the lives in compiles with an error on the last line which looks like this external definition different from previous i think what this is saying is that the assembler version of this struct match the c version of this tried a number of different combinations of word and dword in place of dd in the but i get past this little maybe if i could find a way to get these two declarations to match my need for information about pharlap would be if anyone can think of a better title for this sprawling open to okay it turns out i skimmed over some important this is a file originally written for a phar lap assembler i that trying to assemble using the watcom assember the problem with that particular it turns is it seems phar lap is case while watcom so it sees bhashctl as the same as figured this out with the help of my brother in i never would have thought of case insensitivity being the cause of that lap i need and binaries if

 abstract class is useful when you need a substantial amount to be identical across the for example in cart with multiple methods of payment you an abstract class which defines a generic payment subclasses inherit from the superclass for each actual you want to support credit of how a payment is authorized would be different for but they all perform essentially the same function that a user can prove that they can pay for the goods in example of where an interface is useful is where you have that need to provide some similar functionality in a for you might have a cms where articles are stored in but where the system caches them to disc as well as until the article in the database is at which physical file is deleted until the next time someone access in the your cms might also support the ability to upload etc to be stored for access on the you definitely want these files to be deleted as the copy disc represents the file itself and not a cached in you could create a cacheable interface that says what methods which is cached to disc needs to while leaving it the class itself to implement this makes more sense that represent different kinds of data almost certainly implement their caching scheme class that allows caching would be defined as class which is something you can then check for less experienced coders might test the class of an are working with by getting the class and processing the a big switch this the correct approach means that assuming that certain classes objects and if you add a new class to the system to modify every switch statement in your software to take it if yo uimplement an interface you can test if an that interface with the instanceof instanceof manage approach is better because it eliminates the switch statement makes your software easier to if you add a new the system that also implements its own caching scheme then need to declare that it implements as the all classes to implement it to declare the methods the interface you can be sure that any class that will provide certain methods for you to your need to know how the class implements these just does implement concepts are somewhat trickier to explain than to actually use hopefully got the basic ideas across for you to figure them out for kumar

 according to right in the world seems pretty darned to is also about in the in terms of but nobody seems to ask porsche made huge strides in using who cares if somebody else uses the same programming for a computer language 40 years old how many other languages from the and do you see in use i of the top only 6 and there are a bunch of languages with high instantaneous but which are very likely to drop off the list in well under 40 would consider a language been there for 2 generations to be much more solid than a language been there for only 3 or 4 the latter is likely a the former is a proven and twain and poe are not authors this but may well be authors over the past 40 and i think pretty likely authors over the past they all use an protocol so it matter that the person next to me on the bus is reading a fad like danielle

 actionscript and javascript are implementation of fact actioscript is a better implementation of ecmascript and its object oriented with javascript is that it is rendered by browser engine and each browser uses a different engine so the problem of browser compatibility is always there in actionscript runs on flash player it gives a uniform performance in every can be easily replaced by flex and both are quite infact actionscript is very easy to learn compare to	
 actionscript3 for flash player what is the nicest way to call a function after exactly one am aware of the timer class and and the calllater method on flex uicomponents glancing through the look very efficient in this also aware of settimeout timer class and settimeout utility are both time so how would we guarantee that our function will get called after exactly one my limited testing it seems that functions passed to settimeout only execute after at least one frame setting the delay to but this is not we could listen for events from a but that seems like overkill for a delayed function way to execute a function after exactly one

 actually think that javascript is one of the best languages to start programming when you you really get it and you want to go c is something great to it gives you a much deeper understanding of how computers really really lets you get started see immediate and ramp up to more complex concepts very rest of my answer assumes you know practically nothing about programming web or maybe you know a little html up a text you can even just start with notepad or and put in the the file as and open it in a written a get easier than no need to get into the command line or download or build i remember when i first started being frustrated trying to get php running on my machine and wishing it was as simple as getting started with next step is just to read and documentation is freely available all over for learning i highly recommend anything from and definitive pretty good basic project would be a calculator but lots of fun things you can when gotten your feet and you feel a little more explore some other ruby is a pretty good step from by that point probably know where to go you may never take the road to learning even if you learn you will likely never really have to use	
 ad for your authentication is a great since you need to add everyone there and for intranet users no need for an extra correct that allows you to use a provider which will allow you to authenticate against although nothing included to give you group membership support quite trivial to implement if you want i can provide a real issue here is if you want to use ad groups to define permissions within each so then you do have the option of creating your own roleprovider for that can also be used by winforms and wpf apps via this roleprovider could link the id of the user in ad to per app which you can store in your own custom which also allows each app to allow administration of these roles without requiring these admins to have extra privileges in you want you can also have an override and combine app roles with ad so if in some global group in ad they get full permission in the app regardless of app role conversely if they have either a group or property in ad to say been fired you could ignore all app role membership and restrict all access hr probably remove them from each and every assuming they even know about them code added as based on this original work your

 advise against c and qt and would also recommend your background in pascal and probably javascript feel much more comfortable with done a lot of coding in pascal and where pascal guides you to avoid programming c lets you step right even invites and then have a hard time figuring out why it went qt is a very abstract framework and requires you to learn a lot before you can get something just like with when compared to the easyness we used to have with tp back is much more like pascal in this and its ide is quite modern in regards to supporting your with an gui editor to fill in the gaps for handling ui code when you get into huge program rb loses some of its appeal because it is missing tools to give you a good overview of complex class interactions thing is that qt is more likely to cause mac apps than rb rb visually guides you to get it all aligned nicely in qt you have to work with to position your objects least it was that way when i used qt 2 years written quite a few apps in rb and am pretty happy with the probably write those looking apps that compete with the best on the open small business but if you just want to get some solid code with an ui acceptable to the average give rb a not but its rather small community is on your side eager to instead of bashing everyone trying to talk sense

 after my post i think i am being a little bit unclear about what the problem let me try to can leave comments on my site using a textarea field in a it should be possible to add line breaks in the comment using the comment is then stored as a string in a to make it and later on retrieved from the database and displayed on the regular line breaks are not recognized when the comment is can edit their and in that case the original comment is displayed in a textarea field to be modified image the problem is that if there are any the code is not valid as xhtml error message i make the code valid using any other type of line as stated in the regular line breaks in combination with does not work breaks are displayed in the textarea but not when the comment is displayed as normal text on the have a which includes a textarea field to leave and i want it to be able to add line breaks using below is a simple works as however it does not validate as xhtml transitional when using the w3c validation this is the error i line column document type does not allow element element named above was found in a context where it is not this could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements such as a element in the section instead of inside or two elements that overlap is not common cause for this error is the use of xhtml syntax in html due to rules of implicitly closed this error can create cascading for using tags for and in the section of a html document may cause the parser to infer the end of the section and the beginning of the section and are not hence the reported there a way to make the line breaks valid or do i need to find a workaround using specific tags for line breaks in the textarea field and then replacing them with later on when displaying the to add line breaks in a textarea field while keeping it xhtml

 agree with john in that winforms and wpf are quite close to one another but wpf offers more of a for allowing to implement more independent of the final ui elements used can be easily and obviously wpf allows much more fancy would strongly recommend this blog for some basics and for a clean wpf shows a nice implementation of a rather generic helper for wpf i really like that and i do like that the code is nicely separated from the user control itself by using attached which makes it much easier to use and	
 agree with john on this you know from your own experience in pursuing your understanding the basics of any language is what makes you even more capable in expanding that knowledge or that in it would be best to understand the basics of html and the syntax and overall language will help in the future when you want to pursue large projects using frameworks like django and the basics will also especially help with tweaking like wordpress to be more customizable to your thing in particular that like to mention is that web like many other forms of programming has its own special structure and way of doing is a great way to ensure that your work is passing general web design most sites follow this because it is but from a learning perspective it ensures that you get a nice strong is also a great resource for detailed help on web i like colourful so i like using basic text editors such as or notepad2 or gedit to do my web guis like dreamweaver may tend to fill up your code with extra junk and so i recommend but they are still great

 agree with sarah due to restful way that it stores generally in the user model sets up a virtual attribute for the password which is then used when you go to sign during the signup phase the user object will have the password attribute set to something but when you go to retrieve the user record later on the password field will be think the way of doing things send them a link where they can reset their password rather than just their original password because if they forgot it stopping them from forgetting it	
 agree with that the process id should be stored instead of a process ids are not reused until after a so this should be recommend against using the tmp environment variable for and instead look at this would be more oriented in terms of it would lower the security required to run your both temporary directories and isolated storage will persist after a so need logic to handle that app can clean out the info on you have access to the code of process you are it might be better to use something like named pipes or shared memory to detect whether the application is this also gives you a much cleaner way to shut down the killing a process should be a last resort in i build an application where the design requires killing a process if it was at all

 agree with your and with noticed that a significant amount of the friction i encounter when refactoring can be attributed broadly to inheritance of state i avoid such things and in fact implementation inheritance is very often the quickest way to get to a green but i believe it comes with a so i like to get rid of it as soon as i see methods are one a hint that the superclass has too many responsibilities and the subclasses are likely to be coupled to its internal rather than to its external the whenever i see any method less than public i ask myself whether it indicates a need to split the the answer is just enough of the and no harm in asking the	
 agreement with some earlier you need to have the jar available via the so when you run or compile etc usually include the current directory so that it forget that my code is in the you you must use the java package open the jar in a zip program and file the path to the class files you then put where you replace the folder separators by

 all depends on how you use if you use gaia to make a website then pick apart the created code and figure out how it did the things it did then it will help you learn the flip side if you just publish websites using it and bother to pick it apart to learn the internals then it will simply be a crutch allowing you to never learn how to do it an ability to create something that you could not have otherwise and if you cannot use it again in the you will not have any clue of how to do it as a learning not just a building that was all general comment on building tools in specifically relating to gaia like to add that personally i think most top end devs make their websites much much better than the gaia framework as a matter of only recommend using it as a base learning then building your own framework that you can constantly improve on as you get

 all likelihood going to have to take the eav approach described in another and create a data you would then not only be storing the specific data for an but you would also have a table structure for storing data that defines the data in an exam relationships between basically using the relational aspect of your rdbms to create your own relationship sounds it to an though not as much as it might worth it in the long run if you intend for this medical system to be scalable and not store multiple values in one for any a quick exam patient miscellaneous scalar data thats with an exam value exam value is your basic structure for storing exam then you value group group value group value sort very basic and but it hopefully gives you a glimpse into what talking you may want to take it a step further and define specific exam types that have particular then assign an exam type to an but leave that up to

 all of the deficiencies of c would force you to code around making you write more code making you more experienced in lacking any portable integer bigger than for c in the made me write my own bignum lack of implicit resource and error management maybe force c users to write a lot of and cleanup it may just be but never tired of writing such i go and read the documentation of every external function i return to my code and check for every return value and other it even makes me feel last point is probably the biggest one to be made in favor of the you can only write so many pairs before you start to analyze the lifetime of every single variable you come across in every single objects help this truly portable c code often requires the programmer to be free of a lot assumptions about the host system think unsigned while this helped me write better code in other it has helped me think about possible alternate how a tiny microprocessor could still run my c generating a gazillion risc instructions for my simple is another not many other languages map to and from a given assembly language so easily in my then that may just be none of these arguments go only for has a valid point fortran might be an equally good but there is so much c code a whole personal computer system from top to bottom to libraries to drivers to is available in source code in it would be such a waste if you could not read

 am currently doing a project for school and basically they want us to have this kind of structure all the data access logic the data from the database with either linq of standard a reference to the class library and offering that access the methods from the class a service reference to the web service and using the webmethods to retrieve the basically means that we cannot access the class library directly from the web class of course there are multiple solutions to choose from as to provide abstraction in the web service to separate for example methods that retrieve the articles and methods to retrieve the categories are two different entiries and have two seperate classes in the class can either do one web service which will have all the methods and the website only makes a reference to this one web but of course this will result in having all the methods in a single class a single web i can create multiple web services and reference all of them from the website and then call the one i need depending on what data i need to i mean for the above solutions are not really ideal because if i have the first i will have a ton of methods all in one class abstraction and in the second i will have to reference about 10 different web services from the website for one for school they told us to use the web service web to access the class and then retrieve the data from the class library using the but both solutions i mentioned earlier on seem a bit there a better way of how i might go about in implementing this a webservice as an interface for a data access layer in

 am currently reading in depth by jon skeet and have been reading about value and reference got me thinking about the cost of using value types as method parameters due to that value being copied when while this cost is not much when considering what if those value parameters were strings which got passed around numerous there be a benefit to using say a stringbuilder class and passing it instead of a string you considered that the string was say 1024 and was passed around even just a few times between contrast that with a stringbuilder with the same value which would end up passing the value of the reference being 4 or 8 bytes each you could have a considerable performance question may also highlight a vital piece of understanding i may be missing regarding the string feel free to point this out where what what impact would this have on garbage collection regarding the strings in each apparently i did forget one vital piece of information about strings which renders the question null and thanks of passing lots of value types in	
 am currently storing normalized versions of strings in my sql server database in lower for in my users i have a username and a loweredusername depending on the i either use function or method to generate the lower case version of the user name to fill the loweredusername according to and code analysis rule i should be using instead of according to this is both a performance and globalization converting to upper case is while converting to lower case can cause a loss of information turkish i move to using toupperinvariant for string i will have to change my database schema as since my schema is based on framework related which normalizes strings to lower microsoft contradicting itself by telling us to use upper case normalization in while own code in the membership tables and procedures is using lower case should i switch everything to upper case or just continue using lower case of strings with

 am dealing with a content editable div and i need to deal with capturing key strokes both before and after the character has been added to the understanding of capturing bubbling is that the event gets captured at the highest level in the dom tree first then passes it while for bubbling it starts at the lowest level and bubbles up the on that i thought that if i added an event listener at the capturing the content of the editable div would reflect the text from the keystroke had been if i add an event listener at the bubbling the text content will contain the character i just seem to be the case whether the event listener is added at the capturing or bubbling the content never includes the most recently typed is a simple test case to try it var div would expect the output of the second function to include the new text after typing a but this seem to be the question is there a way to capture a keystroke event from a content editable div and get the content as it will be the key is i need this for implementing typeahead know that i can stop the event and then use but this breaks down when handling pastes and other types of so that is not a am testing this in firefox i know that ie have an addeventlistener for any capturing bubbling with a contenteditable

 am experiencing a weirdest thing for the last couple of i found out that my release build actually executes than the debug the finally stripped all stuff from my entry point in my windows forms leaving only static void stopwatch sw xmls new i am actually not instantiating any forms only is a small class with only three public properties and nothing my main is if that makes any debug my elapsed time is while in release it takes additional strange thing is when i try to set some other project in that solution as startup because in that case it works fast the same code as quick fix this bug as quickly as i created a new startup project in my which instantiates and runs the main application form by referencing my first entry in that case it works fast my entry exe is now only 24kb containing only a static main anyone encountered similar behavior if i had stumbled upon this somewhere by looking at the code i would probably presume that there is a static initializer doing tons of work in a separate thread not the case i have that and furthermore running only in release more i am aware that xmlserializer generates il code in but my actual question is why it works slower in this case than in other when i benchmark only the actual it is 3x slower in release only if i run it from my initial now for the weirdest part after a couple of my new entry project started to behave as the first one slow slow i changed the project name and guid and rebuilt it and working fast release build working slower than

 am writing a library in in which i have among a class originally written in but converted into i know much about so therefore i have used online to now i am stuck with some code which i believe the was not able to running the code i get the following was at really understand the reason for this i believe this error might be due to the fact that is able to automatically convert an integer variable into a string needs the or due to the fact is using an incremental operator which is not supported by is the original in where is a void string the primary character if int idx while code original code works when using a created in is the converted code in which gives me the error mentioned sub primarycharacter as byval alternatecharacter as the primary character if 0 dim idx as integer while idx primarycharacter idx end end if code original code may be found should say that the code in the class is quite advanced for me a hobby programmer but learning every so maybe i see obvious things but this is the reason why i am asking you please give me any hints to sort out this is the complete sub in appends a metaphone character to the and a possibly different metaphone keys for the primary character to append to primary if no alternate char is the alternate key as alternate character to append to alternate may be null or a in which case the primary character will be appended to the alternate key private void string the primary character if int idx while the alternate character if character was if it is not append the primary string as long as it zero length and a space if if int idx while but if the primary character is add that if 0 int idx while else if no alternate character was but a primary so append the primary character to the alternate int idx while unable to convert code from to due to incremental operator or automatic string conversion

 an exception is raised during a crud operation performed by your biz layer it should be handled by the biz but this is because you want feedback to reach the presentation layer you also want to log the you could the exception this will bubble it up to your presentation add a data pair to the property of the exception and then wrap the raised exception into a custom exception type and throw exception will then be bubbled up to your objectdatasource and will be available via the property in your event you should then check if this property is if the objectdatasource wraps plural in a so you will probably need to get at the you could modify the ui elements to provide necessary feedback to users that the operation did not complete you would need to set the property to true to prevent the exception bubbling up to the page for logging the i would log the error in both layers biz logic layer and presentation	
 an explanation in laymans assume you want to fill up a library of and not just stuff them in but you want to be able to easily find them again when you need you decide that if the person that wants to read a book knows the title of the and the exact title to then all it should with the the with the aid of the should be able to go find the book easily and how can you do obviously you can keep some kind of list of where you put each but then you have the same problem as searching the you need to search the the list would be and easier to but you want to search sequentially from one end of the library to the want something with the title of the can give you the right spot at so all you have to do is just stroll over to the right and pick up the how can that be with a bit of forethought when you fill up the and a lot of work when you fill up the of just starting to fill up the library from one end to the you devise a clever little you take the title of the run it through a small computer which spits out a shelf number and a slot number on that this is where you place the beauty of this program is that later when a person comes back in to read the you feed the title through the program once and get back the same shelf number and slot number that you were originally and this is where the book is as others have already is called a hash algorithm or hash and usually works by taking the data fed into it title of the book in this and calculates a number from say that it just converts each letter and symbol into a and sums them all in reality a lot more complicated than but leave it at that for beauty of such an algorithm is that if you feed the same input into it again and it will keep spitting out the same number each so basically how a hash table stuff the size of the the output of such a hash algorithm is inside a range of some large typically much much larger than the space you have in your for say that we have room for exactly one million books in the the output of the hash calculation could be in the range of 0 to one a lot what do we we use something called modulus which basically says that if you counted to the number you wanted the one billion but wanted to stay inside a much smaller each time you hit the limit of that smaller you started back at but you have to keep track of how far in the big sequence that the output of the hash algorithm is in the range of 0 to and you get the value 17 from a particular if the size of the library is only 7 you count and when you get to you start back at since we need to count 17 we have and the final number is course modulus calculation done like done with and the remainder of dividing 17 by 7 is 3 goes 2 times into to and the difference between 17 and 14 is you put the book in slot leads to the next since the algorithm has no way to space out the books so that they fill the library exactly the hash table if you it will invariably end up calculating a number that has been used in the library when you get to the shelf and the slot number you wish to put a book already a book collision handling methods including running the data into yet another calculation to get another spot in the or simply to find a space close to the one you were given right next to the previous this would mean that you have some digging to do when you try to find the book but still better than simply starting at one end of the at some you might want to put more books into the library than the library in other you need to build a bigger since the exact spot in the library was calculated using the and size of the it goes to follow that if you resize the you might end up having to find new spots for all the since the calculation done to find their spots has hope this explanation was a bit more down to earth than buckets and functions

 an interesting going to address concepts around the question rather than answer the question directly i know that much about gcc probably already explored some manipulation of the source code to achieve what you want to some kind char return with with a macro on the function if looking for a compiler then you probably want to modify are some gcc extensions discussed that sound a bit like what going if gcc has anything that does what you probably be documented in the area of the i find anything that sounded exactly like what but perhaps since you understand best what looking know better how to find gdb script would do a pretty good job of outputting but it sounds like got bigger plans than simply doing inserting significant logic into the code seems to be what reminds me of some dynamic linker tricks come across library could insert code around function calls without affecting the original the example encountered was on but there is probably an analog on other came across the option documented instrumentation calls for entry and exit to just after entry and just before function the following profiling functions will be with the address of the current function and its call some does not work beyond the current so the call information may not be available to the profiling functions void void void void i guess this work because you are not able to modify the return value from the profiling

 another thread were to check the variable i believe it to quirks in the memory see a partially initialized the new of java memory model means that any fields should be set to their values before the object becomes visible to other threads long as the reference to the newly created object escape from the constructor in any other but beyond that there many share data without appropriate locking guarantees given by static inializers memory models are seriously as is programming in try to avoid this becoming a terms the assignment happens the constructor runs so if you observe the variable the same it will be null during the constructor as i say there are memory model for the purposes of you can get away with this your field is and using java 5 or prior to java 5 the memory model strong enough for you need to get the pattern right see effective 2nd item 71 for more my reasoning for arguing against inlining being visible in a single suppose we class public static foo f public static void f new make this nested if you i believe it affects the class public boolean public fwasnull believe this will report from three steps are the operand is evaluated to produce a if this evaluation then the expression completes abruptly for same the operand not evaluated and no the operand is if evaluation completes the assignment expression abruptly for the same reason and assignment the value of the operand is converted to the type the is to value set conversion the appropriate standard value an value and the result of the conversion stored into the from actions can be ordered by a if one action then the first is visible to and ordered before the we have two actions x and we write to indicate that x x and y are actions of the same thread and x comes before y in program then is a edge from the end of a constructor of an object to the start of a finalizer for that an action x a following action then we also have and then should be noted that the presence of a relationship between two actions does not necessarily imply that they have to take place in that order in an if the reordering produces results consistent with a legal it is not other okay for weird stuff to happen even within a single thread that be in this case the difference be which is why i believe it would be

 answer is but let me offer the perspective of someone who is using have sort of been the whipping boy of the rails community for a everyone understands the drawbacks of but no one is really championing their in my factories by themselves can easily become just as difficult to maintain as fixtures really depends on the but i the real strength of factories is in selective replacement of talk about a couple first issue is if you can test most of your app without hitting the database then you will see a significant speed but for most applications i think wise to test without hitting the database at some point you want to test the whole every time you mock or stub you are making an assumption about an interface that may contain subtle assuming that you need to hit the database on some significant percentage of transactional fixtures using transactional fixtures could well be much much faster than instantiating a whole environment for every with the size of your test suite that you really need to look towards to scale your development to the next no matter how much you speed them still a long time for developers to maybe look at as well to help at the individual but ultimately ci is going to allow you to maintain testing discipline without sacrificing developer place where fixtures really shine is in the way i look at it is that the fixtures should set up a healthy base state for the app to be most unit tests really need you can get very good unit coverage using however when it comes to functional any given page may be hitting dozens of i want to set up all that stuff in each as i construct ever more complex getting closer and closer to recreating a global data state which is what fixtures were designed to do in the first controversial belief i hold is that all else being i prefer one functional test to 20 unit tests rails because the functional test proves that the end result that is sent to the user is the unit tests are great for getting at nuances of but at the end of the you could still have a bug along an interface that breaks your entire functional tests are what give me the confidence hitting deploy without actually loading up the page in my i know that i could stub everything out and test both interfaces and get the same but if i can test the whole stack in one simple test at the expense of a little much rather do what are my best practices for up a handful for every model to cover the broadest categories of adding a major new feature that cuts across many models and add some new fixtures to represent the major editing old fixtures except for factories for more localized factories for testing pagination or other mass creation that is only needed for a few let me recommend for really good pragmatic testing the thing i like most about blog is that he always acknowledges that testing is very and what works for one project does not necessarily work for

 answer the specific i think there is any way to set up a transaction in the database sense that will do what you think about it and see no guarantee that the various parts of your operation will be handled by the same or quite likely even the same if the request spans database as it will in this the uncommitted parts from one connection will be invisible to the other well as the ideas already consider using one or more tables to hold the incomplete data already then when the user is a single transaction can apply the data to the permanent tables and remove the staging incomplete data can be cleared out on an age criterion by a background process once confident the session has been or held until the user should that better meet your lean towards this approach particularly if i expected to have regular incomplete because this way i have to deal with incomplete data in my main

 applets would seem to have their best analogies to browser in if not no perfect mirror between java and in this respect some technolgoies seem to be more similar to each other in certain respects and others in different given that java was developed largely for the purpose of and the framework for desktop there are naturally going to be fundamental although wpf browser applications are of course restricted to the windows platform they perhaps resemble applets more greatly in the respect that they can utlise the entire among other as has been pointed silverlight is more analogous to terms of the equivalent is effectively the whole of the web application side as opposed to though that is being slightly perhaps more most resembles webforms or mvc for that in the case of the former content is compiled into java whereas in the case of the latter content is compiled into so maybe assemblies of are most akin to servelets though to be honest i know enough about the java side of things to make much of a the histories of and java began somewhat differently they were both vm and java inspired nonetheless in many aspects they have converged over time so that nowadays pretty much find an equivalent technology in either of the two though often in one there has been significantly more development success is one example in favour of whereas applets are perhaps in favour of hopefully at least provided an overview of where the similarities and differences lie in the two	
 application	
 application appears to have the same characteristics as i wrote a mysql custom storage engine to efficiently solve the it is described your data is laid out on disk as an array of 2m fixed length entries per each containing 3650 rows per of 20 bytes row for one entity per read pattern reads one it is contiguous on disk so it takes 1 seek and read 3650x20 about 80k at maybe so it is done in a fraction of a easily meeting your read update has to write 20 bytes in 2m different places on in simplest case this would take 2m seeks each of which takes about so it would take if you spread the data across 4 disks it could take the places are only 80k in the which means there are 200 such places within a 16mb block disk cache so it could operate at anything up to 200 times reality is somewhere between the storage engine operates on that kind of although it is a little more general purpose than a fixed length could code exactly what i have putting the code into a mysql pluggable storage engine means that you can use mysql to query the data with various report generators the you could eliminate the date and entity id from the stored row they are the array and may be the unique id if you really need it since is and store the 2 values as then your stored row is 6 and you have 700 updates per 16m and therefore a faster inserts and a smaller compare to flat notice that comments general favor flat forget that directories are just indexes implemented by the file system and they are generally optimized for relatively small numbers of relatively large access to files is generally optimized so that it expects a relatively small number of files to be and has a relatively high overhead for open and and for each file that is all of those are relative to the typical use of a file system names as an index for a which i take to be a integer 1 to 2million is in a programming you would use an not a for and you are inevitably going to incur a great deal of overhead for an expensive access path that could simply be an array indeing if you use flat why not use just flat and index on performance of this application is going to be dominated by disk seek the calculations i did above determine the best you can do you can make insert quicker by slowing down select you make them both it matter whether you use a or one that you can add more seeks that you really need and slow it down for indexing its the file system index or a database causes extra compared to array look and these will slow you on benchmark have a table that looks very much like yours almost exactly like one of your it was 64k entities not 2m of and 2788 the table was created in the same insert order that yours will and has the same index a select on one entity takes seconds to inspect the 2788 which is about 130 seeks per second as expected 8 millisec average seek time the select time is going to be proportional to the number of and not much dependent on the number of will be faster on disks with faster seek using a pair of sata2s in raid0 but that making much you the table into entity alter table x order by the same select takes 198 millisecs it is reading the order entity in a single disk the alter table operation took days to complete 182m a few other things the measurements tell your index file is going to be as big as your data it is 3gb for this sample that means my all the index at disk speeds not memory insert rate will decline the insert into the data file is linear but the insert of the key into the index is at 180m records i was getting 153 inserts per which is also very close to the seek it shows that mysql is updating a leaf index block for almost every insert you would expect because it is indexed on entity but inserted in day so you are looking at to do your daily insert of 2m by whatever effect you can get by partition across systems or	
 application by itself with default priority cannot make a system however kernel can and an application do much without calling the kernel has many mechanisms that take precedence over regular running those these have the highest say if you have a device with problem the system will become these come second in the dpcs are basically deferred interrupt processing when a dpc is running multitasking is esentially disabled scheduler itself is a dpc if you have a designed device driver queuing too many dpcs the system may become these are like dpcs but run in a certain thread they are mostly used to copy results to process passive level code cannot run before apcs are is windows cache which works on a separate higher priority thread to write changes in a file to acting as a lazy write this thread takes precedence over regular threads and long running flush operations can hinder system on pagefile volume causes paging operations to be delayed for multiple even if on a different partition have the this can slow down anything on the try the same app on a different disk to see the these mechanisms are involved in a single file so depending on the storage device driver you filter drivers you have installed on the you might end up with an this is usually not the case with device say your is running on a different disk than the then i would recommend starting with perfmon to understand going drill down to sub categories memory manager to understand taking the most process explorer also helps to see dpc and interrupt execution if anything around you might have a buggy otherwise there may be a filter driver interfering with

 approach of that kind of problem would probably seem completely crazy to most of you but here is what i would some java code that builds a proper latex document for my latex to compile dvipdf to make it into a you know latex it would probably a couple of hours to and then if you want to generate plain or whatever version of your doc dvi has a converter for they are you have it in about 30 you have the latex source that can be edited by hand or included if need	
 approach sounds good to me controls are designed to help you reuse i think a set of usercontrols would work just fine	
 approach sounds in my current i force https when a user goes to my login on a config flag which lets me test locally without dealing with needing a this allows me to access other pages unsecured which is have a couple places where our server grabs the output of other pages to html to pdf and fetching dynamic images for because of our our server resolve public so if we were to force ssl at the site have to our internal ip address fake the domain for your second question you have two options to handle the vs you can buy a certificate that allows you to have multiple domain these are known as ucc second option is to redirect to or the other way redirecting is a great option if want your content to be indexed by google or other search since they will see and as two seperate this means that links to your sites will be split reducing your overall page	
 approach to scalability is within a single scaling across machines is a tougher the short answer there scala and lift do anything to either help or hinder horizontal far as actors within a single lift achieves better scalability because a single instance can handle more concurrent requests than most other to i first have to point out the flaws in the classic handling bear with this is going to require some typical framework uses a thread to service a page when the client the framework assigns a thread out of a that thread then does three it reads the request from a it does some computation involving to the and it sends a response out on the at pretty much every the thread will end up blocking for some when reading the it can block while waiting for the when doing the it can block on disk or network it can also block while waiting for the while sending the it can block if the client receives data slowly and tcp windows get filled the thread might spend 30 of time it spends of its on that one jvm can only support so many threads before it really slows thread contention for entities connection pools and and native os limits all impose restrictions on how many threads a jvm can if the jvm is limited in its maximum number of and the number of threads determines how many concurrent requests a server can then the number of concurrent requests will be determined by the number of are other issues that can impose lower for threads are a fundamental limiting but not the only decouples thread from in a request does tie up a a thread does an action reading the then sends a message to an actors are an important part of the because they are scheduled via a pool of threads gets used to process messages within important to avoid blocking operations inside of so these threads get returned to the pool that this pool visible to the part of support for a request currently blocked on database or disk for keep a thread the request handling thread is almost to receive more method for decoupling requests from threads allows a lift server to have many more concurrent requests than a also like to point out that the grizzly library supports a similar approach without more concurrent requests means that a single lift server can support more users than a regular java ee

 approach well it is secure when using https but once switched to http all data is being transmitted over an unencrypted the session id cookie the status and user identifiction is as so still a gap to steal that information on the unencrypted line and try to impersonate this approach is because https has some one is that is expensive outgoing and decrypting incoming and another is that it disables at least public

 are a couple of good ways to try and determine unique none of them are exact is why different analytics will report different first is to use a create a cookie for the user for each time frame that you want to track so you could create one that expires in a day and one that expires in a you can then use both of those to track how many unique visitors you of course this is not perfect since people can clear or refuse but it is pretty other way is to track uniques using a combination of the ip address and user agent of the requesting this is probably slightly less accurate since if a company has a good it group lots of internal users will have the same user agent and since they are all coming from the same internal network could have the same ip you are interested in reading more about the different methods there is a great article about it

 are a couple of the solution is simply to cast the ints to you can do the although you should use a a better idea is to use the overload base still has to be a but the exponent can be an int at prefix probably necessary compilers make the function available in the global namespace as to access the versions of the you have to include the version of the instead of you need to provides versions of every c using this naming if the c header is called the version will be when writing in you should always prefer these	
 are a few big benefits to using a framework over sure very proud of the fact that slung enough js to be able to write animations from you should abstracting common functionality away from yourself is actually very you just call the method and know the innards will be and executed even if very fast at writing the stuff still time spent on that instead of solving using a common framework is like speaking a common you can collaborate with other developers very and each can pick up where others left off without to stepping into an application which uses a homegrown library for the things jquery can the people working on jquery are javascript i am really good at and you probably are but a big difference between normal good and jquery a team of insanely good people are constantly poring over a small set of common functionality tuning tweaking enhancing it to make it the best it can possibly that represents a huge number of a single person like you or me simply cannot no matter how good we and if you as good as the jquery you can only benefit by combining your talent with theirs and contributing to the jquery a melting pot of insane

 are at least two problems with your code as calling coinitialize in creating a com object in surprise me if doing something in which you also be doing in the reason that your crash was by not using the smart pointer is because now not actually releasing the object your code is and not releasing the reference a valid way to fix would suggest that you and then the documentation for paying particular attention to the things you should never do within your implementation of the as see right up there are serious limits on what you can do in a dll entry to provide more complex create an initialization routine for the you can require applications to call the initialization routine before calling any other routines in the suspect once you read and fix your code to create the com object at a valid and release it at a valid your shell extension will stop	
 are calling the function as if it is which means the caller pushes the arguments and cleans up the receiving function is which implies the callee cleans up the the callee is expecting a single argument so will pop 4 bytes off the the function returns the caller will then pop off two pointers previously pushed on two so your stack is being corrupted by 4 calling conventions use the same return and have the same register rules ecx and edx are not see for more on the stack frame layout and alignment this mismatch could cause a number of if you are lucky then you get away with if not you might mess up the return address of your main causing the program to crash when it branches to if the compiler has injected some kind of stack guard to catch corruption then it will likely detect this and abort the

 are right in your examination and as far as i can tell there is really no direct solution to the problem the reasons lies in the nature of inheritance among which has only a vague resemblance of inheritance among inherited interfaces is a brand new that has some methods in common with the interface it inherits but no direct so by choosing not to implement the base class you are making a specific assumption that the compiled program will timplementation does not implement think is somewhat of a interface extension makes more a common practice is to have a base class implementing the base and than derived classes implementing the extended but in case you want a separate class that implements both simply list those it there a specific reason you want to avoid just you like should even hard type cast an when you do on an interface it will adjust the object vtable pointers in the right if you do a hard cast have methods to you code can easily my impression is that you are treating interfaces like objects inheritance and casts in the same while their internal working is really

 are several problems in the code sample you posted i will address in has been deprecated for quite some time as it can leave dependent variables in inconsistent states in some see sun answer for more a preferred method of stopping and starting a thread is as volatile thread synchronized void runner new synchronized void thread moribund runner void stuff which can be interrupted if your measurements list is accessed by multiple threads event thread and your user at the same time without any it looks like you have to roll your own you can use a you are creating a new socket every iteration of your sending this is a rather heavyweight and only really make sense if you expect measurements to be extremely infrequent one an hour or either you want a persistent socket that is not recreated every loop of the or you want a one shot runnable you can and which creates a sends all relevant and quick note about using a persistent socket methods which such as cannot be interrupted by and so when you want to stop the you must close the socket as well as calling there is little point in throwing your own exceptions from within a thread unless you expect to catch it somewhere a better solution is to log the error and if it is stop the a thread can stop itself with code like the same context as void stuff which can be interrupted if in this case since the loop will exit if you want to be sure a thread exits with the rest of your no matter a good technique is to call after creation and before you start the this flags the thread as a daemon meaning the vm will ensure that it is automatically destroyed if there are no threads running as if your app best practices with regards to threads should ensure that your app hang or slow down the though they can be quite complex

 are the core principles and motivating forces behind the the extent that used mostly about code reuse and used it before in the guest user admin model and it certainly proves its value when you need to move a user from one group to extend this to having organizations and companies represented with users under and really providing a form of abstraction that particularly inherent in does it prescribe you do to your data bit above pretty high level and quite incorrect in some been on project that used but i working with a separate team on other pretty correct in your bit though it needs some more you can imagine a situation where an entity in the database it a contracts out to another which may in turn subcontract work a party might be an a or a all subclasses of from my you would have a party table and then more specific tables for each which could then be further subclassed person has your experience led you to feel about did you use and would you do so what the pros and has its benefits if you need flexibly to add new types to your system and create relationships between types that you expect at the beginning and architect in moving to a new companies hiring other it also gives you the benefit of running a single query and retrieving data for multiple types of parties on the flip adding additional layers of abstraction to get to the data you actually need and are increasing load at least the number of on the database when querying for a specific if your abstraction goes too likely need to run multiple queries to retrieve the data as the complexity would start to become detrimental to readability and database the party model limit your choice of for did have to eliminate certain orms they allow for enough of between domain objects and your physical is an area that admittedly a bit weak but found that using views and mirrored abstraction in the application layer made this too much of a the real problem for me has always been a is piece of data x when i want to read the data source directly not always intuitive for new developers on the system

 are three basic approaches to this in your the downside here is that if you you get a plugin that escapes content when it is my plugin does then you have to use in your views there are others that work on the controller the downsides here are if a bug in the escaping you could get xss in your and there are corner cases where still want to use a plugin that escapes content when it is is probably the best known of this aliases your attributes so that when you call it escapes the a way around it if you need the content i like this plugin but not wild about letting xss into my database in the first there are some hybrid no reason why you use and crosssitesniper at the same also a erb implementation called that can be configured so that any call like is escaped the equivalent of erubis always seems to lag behind rails and so using it can slow you you want to read i wrote a blog post xavor kindly linked about

 are three types of standards behaviour you should be interested this will work on all complying use this as it depends on the implementation but at least still implementations are required to document what they do in these use this if you care about anything can and we mean up to and including your entire computer collapsing into a naked singularity and swallowing you and a large proportion of your never use make me come over more that 4 characters and a to a is undefined it matter why your program crashes with 14 characters but not almost certainly overwriting some information on the stack and your program will most likely produce incorrect results in the crash is better since at least it stops you relying on the possibly bad the size of the array to something more suitable in this case with the available or use some other data structure that can you seem so concerned with finding out why an extra 7 characters cause problems but 8 characters envisage the possible stack layout on entering i say since the actual layout depends on the calling convention that your compiler since the c code calls with and the stack at the start of after allocating space for a could look like c code return address argc argv x you write the bytes it overwrites the and on return from specifically populates populates and populates provided you actually try to after be if you write the extra to it overwrites the and one byte of the return address so when attempts to return to the c it goes off into fairy land this depends entirely on the calling convention of your possible a different compiler would always pad out arrays to a multiple of 4 bytes and the code fail there until you wrote another three even the same compiler may allocate variables on the stack frame differently to ensure alignment is what they mean by you going to

 are two internal wikis that used in the had great success with open source wiki	
 are two objects notifier and notifier knows nothing about while observer knows that notifer implements a uses the event to inform other objects that something simply spoken an event is a list of because observer wants to be notified if something observer adds a that should be called if something to the event of if the thing that notifier publishes with this notifier just walks over the list of methods and calls when the method added by observer is observer knows that the thing happend and can do what ever is required in this is a example notifier class with a declare how a method must look in order to be used as an event delegate void int32 int32 class constructor with an instance public public string name private the event that is raised when changes private field public event valuechangedhandler a method that modifies the private field value notifies observers by raising the valuechanged public void check if value really if safe the old int32 oldvalue change the raise the valuechanged private int32 value raises the valuechanged private void int32 copy the event handlers this is for thread safty avoid that somebody changes the handler to null we checked that it is not null but before we the valuechangedhandler valuechangedhandler check if we must notify if call all methods added to this a example observer class constructor with an instance public public string name private the method to be registered as event public void int32 int32 the value of changed from to small test static void create two notifiers notifier a and notifier notifier notifiera new notifier notifierb new create two observers observer x and observer observer observerx new observer observery new observer x subscribes the event of notifier observer y subscribes the event of notifier a and change the value of notifier a this will notify observer x and change the value of notifier b this will only notify observer this will not notify anybody because the value is already this will not notify observer x and y output will be the the value of notifier a changed from 0 to the value of notifier a changed from 0 to the value of notifier b changed from 0 to the value of notifier a changed from 123 to the value of notifier a changed from 123 to understand delegate types i am going to compare them with class class public void something with text public void something with defined a simple class with two now we can use this class example new this works the following does not work because the types do not you get a compiler example new we can use the variable the same with a delegate first we define a delegate type this is just a type definition like the class definition delegate void we can use the delegate but we cannot store normal data in a delegate type but a method have now stored the method of the object the following does not work because we defined as a delegate taking one string parameter and returning returns void but takes an integer parameter so you get a compiler method finally you can use the variable you cannot perform data manipulation because the variable stores no data but a but you can call the method stored in the stuff with calls the method we stored in the variable	
 are two possible ways for a device to get an the plug and play or pci if you do so the bios will call your peripherical device and ask for the resource afterwards your driver can enumerate the search for the supported device and get the hardware interrupt from the it has been done in the early just use one add a to the device that allows the user to select between different the resource allocation is at the hand of the users the user will also pass the interrupt number to the driver at load time how to hook the that depends on the os and the mode the x86 is running for a bare bone system you can query the idt descriptor via a special once you have that idt you can get the address and poke the address of the irq handler into the correct for real mode i know how done you have at least a little realtime os or something likely that there is already a kernel function that does the hard work for	
 are two simple ways to do one way is a simple 5 12 12 15 23 15 18 12 char will do it the char answer is better because it does not require you to store a list of letters to index v is best since when you add to it converts to its ascii representation on the will yield the ascii form of nice thing is it also works for so if you wanted just add v can find more information about working with strings in matlab from these

 are two things which can help the first is the equivalent of the java null pointer it can actually receive messages and respond to it will always return if the return value is an and if the return value is some primitive therefore if the null behaviour of your object is you can easily just use as the null other thing which is helpful is for when you need to store a placeholder or null value in a container object these usually throw exceptions if you attempt to add as a instead you can use the singleton which does nothing except act as a space intentionally left these two weapons at your disposal there should be no reason to write a null instance of a custom class

 array is an array of it is not an array of buffers of some if you do will get the sizeof of the first element of that equivalent your array stores in the line that allocate 4 or 8 pointers in one array on how wide a pointer on your platform usually either 4 or but of course not what you wanted to do is create an array of pointers of the same size as you will have to first get the total size of the animals and then divide by the size of one that is what you but the pointers will yet have indeterminate next you pass the array using for the why you can pass taking its address and then dereference is the same as doing nothing in the first in the function you you copy the strings pointed to by elements in to some indeterminate destination the elements of the array the pointers have yet indeterminate we have not assigned them you first have to allocate the right amount of memory and make the elements point to now after this the pointer points to something animal animal no need to dereference the forget to increment animals about the sizeof one important thing you have to be sure the way we calculate the whatever you make sure you always have enough room for your a c string consists of characters and a terminating null which marks the end of the should point to a buffer that is at least as large so that it contains space for animal and the first contains 11 the second depends on what we actually copy over its length is what in total we for all characters including the terminating now not good style to hardcode that number into your the prefix could change and you could forget to update the number or miscount about one or two that is why we use which we provide with the string literal we want to have recall that a expression evaluates to the size of its you use it in to get the total size of your array now you use it for the string all string literals are arrays of string literals consist of the characters you type to the null the following condition because counts the length of a c and does not include the terminating null character to its would have the type of 4 have to divide by the size of one because the sizeof char is one so it make a why do we use instead of because it already accounts for the terminating null and it evaluates at compile the compiler can literally substitute the size that the sizeof expression

 as probably is that got one form inside another form ie the legacy form is appearing inside the form required by the master quick rather way to get around this is to close the form above the legacy and then open a new form below the legacy this means got three forms on the none of which are you end up with something like closing tag at the start closes the from the master you then have your which should now work as then the open tag at the end simply ensures that the closing tag from the master page is valid anything appearing on the master page after the legacy form be within the standard so this may not work for you depending on how the rest of your page is not a particularly elegant but it works as a quick fix on what else is on your master used it where we had one legacy form required on a site with hundreds of so we simply wanted a fix rather than anything that affected the master page our we change the legacy form as this was supplied by a regularly and needed to be dropped into the page without a developer getting involved to amend it as opposed to solution to his own question which requires editing the form and is clearly a better option in his case and probably in most other cases where there is a similar

 avoid 2 developers working on the same package at the same use your version control system as the source of the package to work on a the developer must first check out the package from version nobody else can check the package out until this developer checks it back work directly on the package code in toad or any other you have whether the code you are working on there is correct or has been modified by one or more other work on the code in the script you have checked out from version and run that into the database to compile the my preference is to use a nice text editor and sql but you can do this in toad when you have check the script back into version copy and paste code out of the database into your script point 2 downside it is of this controlled approach is that only one developer at a time can work on a this be a major problem as long keep packages down to a reasonable size terms of what they not how many lines of code or number of procedures in have one big package that holds all the are encouraged to check out code only when ready to work on and to check it back in as soon as they have finished making and testing their

 basic idea is to write the wcf code for your clients in just easier this and use a bridge dll to bridge the gap between your unmanaged code and the managed wcf code written in is the process using visual studio 2008 along with first thing to do is create the wcf service and a means to host if you already have skip to step 7 create a windows nt service following the steps from use the default names offered by vs2008 for the project and any classes that are added to the this windows nt service will host the wcf a wcf service named helloservice to the to do the project in the solution explorer window and select the menu in the add new item select the wcf service template and click the add this adds the helloservice to the project in the form of an interface file a class file and a default service configuration file the helloservice like public interface string public class helloservice public string return the service1 class created in step 1 above to look like partial class service1 private servicehost public protected override void string args new helloservice protected override void try if catch the the visual studio 2008 command navigate to the output directory for the type the this installs the windows nt service on your local open the services control panel and start the service1 it is important to do this in order for step 9 below to another instance of visual studio 2008 and create an mfc which is about as far away as you can get from as an i simply created a dialog mfc application and added a say button to the project in the solution explorer and select the properties menu under the general change the output directory to under the general add to the additional include under the linker general add to the additional library click the ok the file select the menu select the class library change the name to helloserviceclient and click the ok the project in the solution explorer and select the properties menu in the build change the output path to so the assembly and file will be in the same directory as the mfc this library will contain the service the wcf proxy to the wcf hello service hosted in the windows nt the solution the references folder for the helloserviceclient project and select the add service menu in the address type the address of hello this should be equal to the base address in the file created in step 2 click the go the hello service should show up in the services click the ok button to automatically generate for the hello seem to always run into compilation problems with the file generated by this i know if doing it wrong or if there is a but the easiest way to fix this is modify the file the problem is usually a namespacing issue and can be fixed with minimal just be aware that this is a for this changed the to simply helloservice with any other required allow the mfc application to interact with the wcf we need to build a managed from the file select the menu select the win32 project change the name to helloserviceclientbridge and click the ok for the application change the application type to dll and check the empty project click the finish first thing to do is modify the project the project in the solution explorer and select the properties menu under the general change the output directory to and change the common language runtime support option to common language runtime support under the references add a reference to the and mscorlib click the ok the following files to the helloserviceclientbridge project and the to look like dllapi dllapi comment if link dllapi static const the to look like dllapi helloserviceclientbridge syntax for the file uses managed which takes some getting used modify the to look like namespace namespace namespace namespace const binding gcnew address gcnew client gcnew try call to wcf hello message marshal from managed string back to unmanaged intptr ptr rv catch return only thing left to do is update the mfc application to invoke the on the mfc the say button to generate the buttonclicked event make the event handler look like try message name catch the application and click the say this will cause the application the method of the wcf hello service hosted in the windows nt service should still be by the the return value is then displayed in a message you can extrapolate from this simple example to fit your if this does not please let me know so i can fix the	
 basic rules are actually fairly where it gets tricky is in how they apply to your cache works on two temporal locality and spatial former is the idea that if you recently used a certain chunk of probably need it again the latter means that if you recently used the data at address probably soon need address cache tries to accomodate this by remembering the most recently used chunks of it operates with cache typically sized 128 byte or so even if you only need a single the entire cache line that contains it gets pulled into the so if you need the following byte already be in the this means that always want your own code to exploit these two forms of locality as much as jump all over do as much work as you can on one small and then move on to the and do as much work there as you simple example is the 2d array traversal that answer if you traverse it a row at a reading the memory if you do it read one then jump to a completely different location start of the next read one and jump and when you finally get back to the first it will no longer be in the same applies to jumps or branches mean less efficient cache usage not reading the instructions but jumping to a different of small probably change anything only skipping a few so still end up inside the cached but function calls typically imply that jumping to a completely different address that may not be unless it was called cache usage is usually far less of an issue what you usually need to worry about is the data a struct or all members are laid out which is in an all entries are laid out contiguously as in linked each node is allocated at a completely different which is pointers in general tend to point to unrelated which will probably result in a cache miss if you dereference if you want to exploit multiple it can get really as only one cpu may have any given address in its l1 cache at a so if both cores constantly access the same it will result in constant cache as fighting over the

 been batting this problem around in my head for a few days now and come to any satisfactory conclusions so i figured i would ask the so crew for their for a game that working on using a component object model as described and actually going fairly well but my current storage solution is turning out to be limiting can only request components by their class name or an arbitrary what i would like is the ability to request a given type and iterate through all components of that type or any type derived from considering this first implemented a simple rtti scheme that stores the base class type through the derived type in that this means that the rtti a sprite would this allows me to compare types easily to see if type a is derived from type b simply by comparing the all elements of is derived from but not and already i want now is a way to store the components in a way that represents that the first thing that comes to mind is a tree using the types as like timer sprite each node i would store a list of all components of that that way requesting the node will give me access to all renderable components regardless of derived the rub is that i want to be able to access those components with an so that i could do something like have that iterate over the entire tree from renderable i have this pretty much working using a really ugly node structure and an custom forward iterator that tracks a node stack of where all the while i felt that there must be a clearer i just think of one the question am i this is there some obvious simplification or structure i should be or is this just inheritly a complex problem and probably doing just fine for any input you for hierarchal component

 been learning been able to create gui even simple programs will not if they require a research on the topic has lead me to the conclusion that my java runtime environment does not have a console associated with it possible to call the win32 method like is possible in mean the console like you are a console just like programs can forgot to mention that using the eclipse from what discovered eclipse runs a program using instead of which causes the program not to have a the windows is a program that uses the type of console i for any is on the right track as to what i am trying to by the way his method but i want the console to automatically appear when i click on the file of a program i i need the console to act like it does in at eclipse does have a console window think they call it the console but i am used to using visual studio so i am not exactly which will display the program output eclipse i want the console to work at not just inside the integrated development can i associate a console with a java

 been my experience that hr departments rarely have a clue about anything other than hr regulations and insurance information and company as far as having a real technical i have yet to talk to anyone in an hr department that was really up on current programming so they have to rely on the buzzwords and requirements given to them by the departments that are in need of sometimes the managers all that up on it your first goal is to get the interview one with the folks that actually have a vested interest in your and so if they ask if got then say what written that you hr departments often work for companies with a number of job types and i expect them to know the ins and outs of each of the i suspect sometimes they are just checking off things that match the provided checklist of you get the interview with the technical you can talk about your experience and get it or they hr departments have to deal with all sorts of resumes and in the current environment sure the quality of the candidates vary had a lot of folks interviewing at my shop fortunately our also slings code all so he has a

 been playing around with measuring the cyclomatic complexity of a big code complexity is the number of linearly independent paths through a source code and there are lots of free tools for your language of results are interesting but not that the parts i know to be the hairiest were in fact the most complex a rating of but what i am finding useful is that a concrete number is assigned to each method as something i can point to when deciding where to start you use cyclomatic the most complex bit of code you you find cyclomatic complexity a useful	
 been pondering this problem myself lately for common markup structures to factor out of jsps into in my library for this would be i found one in the here are a couple of problems that may be related to yours was planning to research the technique mathematical software uses to analytically evaluate integrals in calculus in this there are a bunch of known structural and the problem in question has to be matched to one of the known the best way to do this is not always obvious because it depends on what terms are grouped used in biology to find corresponding structures in two complex molecules might also be adapted to this

 been reading up on themes in my book and thought that it could be a very handy then i met some theme picks up every single css file in the you want to use reset styles ordering is the order of imported stylesheets is not master page would not explicitly indicate what style is being only the rendered page can tell you that unless you dig into your web controls using the theme file you can simply do this in your granular control should be at the html should it do you specify print stylesheets without having all styles in a single wondering as to whether actually worth using at is there any are there any major sites using to clarify last if i had two one called and one called and i used how would it know that was a print in regular html you use the media type in the tag itself but the themes know so it would just get included as a regular themes should they be

 been thinking of a dynamic way of creating a captcha that uses morphing shapes or dynamic first idea is to have a flash or that gradually changes say a square into a the user will be required to click the button when it becomes spherical idea is to have an area of color that slowly changes red to blue and the user will be required to press a button when it becomes blue idea is a combination of both say the difficulty will be to match the clicks with the but it should be hard for automated code to detect shades or people please offer some comments on my for the now considering using a flash based video playback of a server fed video feed of a few colored shapes that morph into other colored the user will be required to pause the feed when the colors and shapes match some canned such as click on the video when you see two green squares turn into 3 blue the shapes will be amongst over overlapping and moving morphing fun for the whole for morphing	
 been thinking of answering this for a but figured someone else might come up with a better because mine is rather not aware of any such unit testing think your best bet is to try and refactor your c module such that dependencies on the httpd code base are contained in a very thin glue i worry too much about dependencies on that can easily be linked into your unit test things like using the request record that you should try to abstract out a little go as far and suggest that such a refactoring is a good idea if the code is suspected to contain security flaws and bad just usually a pretty big you might also consider is running integration tests rather than unit tests come up with a set of requests and expected responses from the and run a program to compare the actual to expected not the response been looking and you probably thought of something along this line but at least i can tell you from experience that if the module be replaced with something new for business then refactoring it for testability will likely pay off in the longer

 been using mercurial for a little but mainly for my own now i have a project working on where two of us are building the same and we will probably be modifiying each would like to setup a mercurial repository on a make that repository the so my changes and the other changes both push to that server basically the i like mercurial though and want to switch to something like in my own everything is done on and my has so pushing my changes work on multiple from one computer to the server is just a matter of the protocol used is for transfering the problem is that i use the server will be windows no and the other editor will be using windows as far as i the best way of working in mercurial in these types of setups is for the repository to pull changes from the rather then the source pushing to the behind several entirely my and my computer be visible from the and assuming the other editor will be behind a firewall too we just start up the local mercurial http server and get the computer to pull from the best way for both editors to get our changes to the server should add that the server is a server on the so it is just as visible as something like a hosted windows but i would probably have permission to install software if needed for

 been writing a lot of code recently that involves interop with the win32 api and have been starting to wonder the best way to deal with native errors that are caused by calls to windows api the calls to native functions look something like nativefunction returns true when successful and false when an when an error the msdn docs usually tell you that error code can be discovered by calling getlasterror long as setlasterror flag has been set in the dllimport is the equivalent managed it throw new line that raises the exception can be equivalently rewritten as such i new this is all well in that it throws an exception appropriately containing the win32 error code that was set as well as a description of the error as the property of the exception i have been thinking that it would be advisable to at least if not of these exceptions so that they give a slightly more error one more meaningful in whatever situation the native code is being i have considered several alternatives for a custom error message in the constructor for new custom error the in another exception object so that both the original error code and message are retained is now the of the parent new custom error same as except using another as the wrapper same as except using a custom class derived from as the wrapper same as except using a bcl class exception as the parent when not sure whether even appropiate to set the to the in this case for a wrapper but not a interface that make it obvious that win32 interop is happening behind the what i want to know what is the recommended practice on dealing with win32 errors in i see it done in code in all sorts of different but i was curious whether there were any design if be interested in your personal preferences you even use none of the above a

 believe that the biggest problem is often that developers are not aware that there is a guideline for a particular design rather than the unwillingness to implement those it is the job to make sure that they have that will always require verbose written guidelines if you are to standardize any type of team effort and weed out the that is going to inherent to system you should keep in mind that no matter how detailed your documents there is probably going to be some unforeseen condition that will be to counter this you should have an policy whereby team members can always come up to the team leader and discuss such these new items should then be updated into the guideline guideline documents should be easily accessible to all stakeholders in the creating a ready reference is often a good	
 believe that the more you start to develop using design find more and more often where composition is going to be favored over i actually believe in the design book that composition over is one of the primary design example of being able to mock up parts of the composition for testing is probably one of the best examples although the basic principle in design patterns is to favor composition over that mean that there design patterns which utilize inheritance where it is another basic example is the decorator where you are coding towards an abstract superclass this is for type matching and not for implementing an

 believe there more answers to one classic example is to iterate a multidimensional array 0 to for 0 to do something with reason this is cache inefficient is because modern cpus will load the cache line with memory addresses from main memory when you access a single memory we are iterating through the rows in the array in the inner so for each trip through the inner the cache line will cause to be flushed and loaded with a line of addresses that are near to the if this is changed to the 0 to for 0 to do something with will run much

 best not to put a relative path into if the current directory changes during execution if you are running from a different directory to the script it if you want to make it relative to the use the character should be escaped to for and really it ought to be using instead of relying on windows path if another imported script has played with it have pulled the wrong path also reloads of your own modules will best leave the path where it name parts your path includes the segment so effectively trying since is already in the path you added to search what you really want is name is a so it should be if you really want to have it write to your local almost certainly want leave the fromlist that module is a module object and wants a module you already have the module why not just reaction to all this is much this overly difficult for yourself and creating a lot of potential problems and fragility by messing around with the internals of the import this is tricky stuff even for experienced python would almost certainly be better off using plain old python modules which you import the list of commands is really no great having all your commands in a with repeat the filenames but is much simpler and more robust than a surfeit of

 by in the you mean display different parts in different then suggest you use a presentation pattern like fowler describes in his if your developing a wpf app you can use the more version called if you by mean that use different attributes of the entity in different or part of your then i agree with probably be better off breaking them into different the reason being that in your domain model you should reflect how the entity is used in that specific and if using different parts of the entity under different they probably have different meanings in these settings which again should be reflected in the naming of the and if it were probably make one repository for each of the having a mapping between entities and repositories seems to make sense in most cases as far as but then just like rob conery and of the developers trying to do fairly new to the and so my experiences might be overruled by someone more experienced

 can understand the i have been there so share how i keep the basic differences a class method then it using the if you choose to from that keyword is intended to evoke the idea that the method may or may not be the actual method i always think of members as meaning that it represents functionality that can be such as an method on a which might involve eating with a class might override the of in order to allow for an implementation that uses chop sticks because virtual methods and properties are the class that defines that member must provide a complete implementation of the method or all objects must how way of thinking might declare that members represent to is an of a class a may to with chop a class method then it overridden using the if you choose to that keyword is intended to evoke the idea that the class only the capability represented by the and that there is not any common logic that can be generalized for that in other members are only and therefore they lack an it is a little confusing that asks us to abstract members when we implement an inheritance but in this case it really means that we are overriding the empty concept with a concrete an example of an member of a class might be there would not be a common way of speaking for all nor is it because it requires language to some might argue that belongs on an way of thinking might declare that members represent behavior be and knowledge or beliefs be to is a behavior of a class a may learn to differently than an and neither knows how to just because they are both methods do not need to be is no such thing as a members can only appear on in the above having an method on the class implies that is an and a cannot be instantiated using the phrase baby new the class should inherit from and it should be instantiated as baby new because a is a and and both also inherit from could inherit from instead of being is because we are all something more than simply members cannot be only their implementations may be up the inheritance for must implement the method as an if inherits from it may then hide the implementation of with its own implementation by using the keyword hiding in reference classes can have a main distinction between an and an in that an class can define both a contract and a template of the whereas an only defines a class versus rahman hiding in chetan

 clean code is easier to bend to your it is possible to design an interface that is simple and mention of hop helps to highlight one of the easiest ways to give huge flexibility to your the ability to pass in a function reference whatever you call it in your language of perl sort function is a perfect example of this pass a code ref and a and get a sorted the code ref works with localized variables and if the code returns comes after return 0 to set an and to put before does the power of this approach come it works so well it encapsulates the the idea behind the visitor pattern is the java is such a verbose language that it costs more to implement and maintain than a bunch of else if else flexibility and simplicity are the result of a good possible to create inelegant crap in any language any design d

 common and are just two structs that add they are for convenience of creators of function object so they have to do those but they behave what you want is function object comes to const str no error make it a const str no error can take it by value and then return the copy from if use it to apply it to some which would allow the function object to update some state variables among its is an example that does it like i would accept them by value because they are usually small and copying them allows greater so i const str no error will then be able to take a copy of fct and save it and can be and update some members is part of the whole point of remember if you take a function object by const you generally copy because the user could have passed a copying it then will try to locally declare a function instead of a local function accepting will accept a function pointer instead when a function was which can safely be

 computers and the amount of ram typically checking everywhere for memory allocation errors is probably too as it is often difficult or impossible to make a rational decision about what to as your process is allocating more and more the os will correspondingly be reducing the amount of memory available for disk when that falls below some then the os will start paging memory to is a as there are many factors in memory the os starts paging the whole system gets progressively slower and and it will probably be quite a while before your application ever actually sees a null from malloc at the sheer amount of memory available on an of error more likely means that a bug in your code tried to allocate an arbitrary amount of in that case no amount of freeing and retrying on the part of your process is going to fix the

 consideration on the use of custom tags over udfs or cfc methods is when you find that a subroutine needs to be passed an array of child you can use nested custom tags to associate a child custom tag and its elements to a parent custom this allows you to do very nice clean coding thats easy to i know we have nicer dhtml stuff like menus and this is simply to point out an you can use cfassociate in the custom tag to the attributes to the parent custom tag and then in the access all the dynamically generated child items in the array of associated this is where you would loop and output the menu to the screen in this as another allows you to do some clever one thing in particular i use is that i set and then i can essentially force simple html tags the to get kicked through a custom tag handler at runtime so an html tag becomes intelligent at i do this so i can analize the href and the target attributes and decide if i want to display a pdf icon other mime type next to the its pretty this is especially helpful in a content management system or when 7you have html developers using dreamweaver or contribute and you want to have their tags fire smart coldfusion tags without them doing anything outside of standard html the editor doesnt know any difference and they dont need to go into view to make some fairly powerful in a custom tag you can choose to suppress output use a so this can be very useful to wrap around chunck of dynamically generated access the variable in the executionmode eq throw out the baby with the bathwater on this one i agree their usage is much less frequent since we have however there is still some powerful functionality in custom i usually have one or 2 in every application at least dozens of	
 considering doing a small project as a part of my masters for doing ocr just for sheetmusic instead of think pil and python would be fine for simple proof of concept question has anyone got any do it with pil use xyz or something in that my delicius links regarding the subject if anyone is now i know a lot more about ocr for sheet music or omr as it is academia the area has been researched since late 70 and building an omr system is not a simple to get a summary of the problems and the research until early 2000 you could read challenge of optical music which is quite successful in drawing up the lines of the existing software i know of at least my unscientific tests gave me the idea that photoscore was the most robust opensource software is the only complete thing i found and is written in my original question i am using gamera is an opensource tool for document image analysis which provides tools to do all the basic stuff needed for analysing images for gamera has a python interface and the possibility to write for example is it possible to and use a staffline removal toolkit for for sheet

 controller convention is so routing can easily find the controller without additional adding the required controller ending makes it less likely that you would accidentally expose an object through mvc is a built in convention for views as by default views should be in a folder named for your controller and be named the same as the action calling this is what enables the method call in your action to work without specifying the i often find myself specifying the view but if you are looking for a convention this is definitely the one encouraged by the a model standpoint you are there is no standard the reason for this is because the mvc framework never directly touches the it needs a convention for the controllers to find them from and it needs a convention for views to find them from the but models are only accessed from logic in the controller so the framework need to know about being said i have seen most people build their models just like they built their entities or domain model before if you are using an active record pattern then name the models to correspond with the tables they are mapped if you are focusing more on a domain then name the models to correspond with the part of the domain they are i have seen more and more people creating a set of view models that are just used for presenting data to the ui and are created by pulling in parts from various models in your models are definitely the least opinionated part of but that is a good thing imo since people have very different ways they like to work in this

 convert at is fully compatible with so you should not find any breaking changes when you if you need to refactor an area because it has problems or you wish to extend it somehow then i would consider migrating to use newer but otherwise why touch it and risk breaking as this is a learning excercise rather than changing production code revise my views this is probably a good way to learn new certainly look at in places where the old code was iterating through lists or manipulating xml or data from a db see if you can using linq

 converter is applied to the property that stores the it will only be called if the collection instance itself changes if items in the collection are one way around this would be to invalidate the collection when you want it to simplest way to invalidate the collection property and cause the converter code to run again would be to out the collection and reassign another way is to get the and call you could instead bind to a subclass and call on if you want to fix the problem you could bind to your own implementation of which does the filtering and raises events as	
 cookie needs to be generated because the session binds the client to the and therefore the token exchange must go from server to client at some it would not really be useful to generate the cookie because the client the untrusted remote is possible to have the cookie set during an ajax to the server the an ajax call is simply an http and any http response by the server can set a so it is possible to initiate a session in response to an ajax and the cookie will be stored by the client as you can use ajax to do the logging in process in the same was as you could have just relied on a post from a form on the the server will see them the same and if the server sets a cookie the browser will store javascript never needs to be able to know the value of the cookie it is better for security if it which can be achieved using the cookie extension honored by recent note that further http calls from the client to the whether they are normal page requests or they are ajax will include that cookie even if marked httponly and the browser honors that your script does not need to be of the mentioned using ssl that prevents others from being able to read information in so very handy for preventing plain text transmission of the password or other important it can also help guard against network based though it does not make you immune to everything that csrf can throw and it does not at all protect you against the likes of session fixation or so i would avoid thinking of ssl as a fix all if you use i sort of combined that the cookie is set by the server in its http response yes it is to make it compatible you still need to ensure logging in is possible when ajax is this may require implementing an alternative that is seen only when there is no javascript or if ajax now in become a lot more realistic to rely on ajax support in would not change the there would be no need for except that i have seen hidden iframes used before to ajax before ie make asyncronous calls to the however you do it the server setting the and the client will accept and return the cookie whether it does it by ajax or the most whether you use ajax or not does not affect the security all that much as all the real security happens on the server and to the server an ajax call is just like a not to be therefore need to be aware of issues such as and as well as issues affecting the session as a whole like and just as much as you would if you were using no the issues really change when using ajax i that you may make more mistakes with a technology if less familiar with it or more updated july	
 cookies are very useful for the authentication in the request url is bad there was a news item last week about getting the authentication tokens in the from the google there is no way to prevent older browsers still allow trivial access to cookies via you can bypass http whatever you come up with can be gotten around given enough the trick is to make it too much effort to be you want to make your site more secure is no perfect you could use an authentication cookie that if the cookie is the attacker must use it before it if they then you have a good indication suspicious activity on that the shorter the time window the better for security but the more load it puts on your server generating and maintaining

 could be but it seems to me that coming from the wrong are two distinct issues you need to making sure that the propertygrid is only ever accessed on the ui if any of its methods property are accessed from other suffer pain in mysterious the exceptions are and of making sure your search thread can run solve the first make sure your objects are never modified by the ui make all of your event triggers thread aware so that your objects events as are only ever triggered on the ui second problem is easier as long as your search thread only reads from your core everything should work your search thread might inadvertently see some partially updated but is that really an couple of final thoughts implement your search to iterate through the propertygrid obtain a list of the objects up front need to be and work through that you considered using idle processing to do the the object fires an event every time the application runs out of messages to process you could hook into this and perform 1 step of your search each time the event is kind of a but with none of the used this to very good effect in the if i recall propertygrid respects the calling as soon as you start modifying a and when you move to a different you could leverage this to prevent your search thread from seeing incomplete following discovered what you already knew that propertygrid respect the ieditableobject do have another suggestion though it might be more work than you want to the time when the namespace was introduced in i saw an article on using the ambient transaction to provide for the idea is that your object properties have dual first you have the committed visible to all and you have a variable used to store uncommitted values on a when a property is the object enlists in any ambient transaction by storing the new value in the thread when the transaction commits or rolls the value for the thread is either stored or i find the original though it seems that csla provides this hope this

 couple of points i stumbled on while creating a dll had to call a member function of the unmanaged took some time to find out that i can not do this by using dllimport but have to write a the wrapper it is also not enough to wrap just the member i have to be able to create a pointer to the so i have to export the pointer to the constructor how i understand maybe not exactly i tried just exporting the member function it compiled but returned at got stuck there for a while my wrapper looks like this suggested in a class defined in a dll in public class return new bool char return void delete on the class level exports all public members of the returns a pointer to that ccnocrsdk class from the unmanaged dll which member function i have to calls that member note that the pointer to the ccnocrsdk is the code builds into the i have to use the to find out what are the entry points for the wrapper dll i my the results look like 1 0 00001240 class const 2 1 00001220 bool ccnocrsdk 3 2 00001200 class ccnocrsdk 4 3 00001410 void ccnocrsdk finally ready to use my wrapper in the when i did this without specifying the entry point exactly as in my output from i got to find entry entrypoint public static extern intptr entrypoint public static extern bool string out is defined as jaredpar the last step is to enjoy the i have to call the class and then pass the pointer to the actual call to the recodata new string num intptr ptr bool res out res returns and i get the results i expected in

 did you come to decide on spring python as your api of spring works well on java where a tradition of declarative defining your application primarily using xml to control a core engine is a standard pattern in while the underlying patterns like inversion of control are still apposite on your use the implementation chosen by spring looks like a classic case of something produced by a java programmer who want to learn see the article is not applaud your decision to introduce order and thoughtfulness to your but you may wish to evaluate a number of options before making your in you may find that using spring python will make it difficult to hire good python many of whom will run the other way when faced with xml files describing object start by what you really want to the problem cannot simply be that need a there are lots of frameworks out and hard to evaluate if you truly need one and which one will work if you identified what underlying software problems you need to the real problem is that your code is an unmaintainable introducing a framework probably fix the instead of just messy have code that is messy in someone style perhaps rigour in the dev team is where you should recommend starting good code stringent hiring a luck with the

 do writing your own crypto system can easily lead to making best to use an existing or if get someone who knows cryptography to do if you have to do it read already have enough insecure do things correct and worry about performance if you are stuck on using aes to roll your here are a few is a block given a key and a block of it converts it to a specific the problem with this is that the same blocks of data will generate the same ciphertext with the same every so suppose you send data like two separate and the userroles encryption will have the same ciphertext each regardless of the all i need is the ciphertext for an and i can drop it right in with my there are operation the main idea is that take the ciphertext of one and xor it into the ciphertext of the next that way do and the username ciphertext is affected by the problem is that the first block is still vulnerable just by seeing i might know their enter the the iv the cipher and ensures it has random data to encrypt the rest of the so now the userroles ciphertext has the ciphertext of the random iv problem make sure you generate a random iv for each the iv is not sensitive and can be sent plaintext with the use an iv large enough the size of the block should be fine for many provide integrity anyone can modify your and the decrypt will still unlikely be data in but it might be hard to know what valid data for if transmitting a guid be easy to modify some bits and generate a completely different that could lead to application errors and so fix there is to run a hash algorithm sha256 or on the and include that in the data you so if my message is send now if someone tampers with the ciphertext by flipping a the hash will no longer compute and you can reject the you need to generate a key from a use the this provides salting and which can improve the strength of derived keys and reduce the chance of discovering the password if the key is sorry for not mentioning this earlier you also need to make sure you have an if you simply encrypt the message and pass it anyone who gets the message can just resend to avoid you should add a timestamp to the if the timestamp is different by a certain reject the you may also want to include a id with it could be the and reject messages that come from other ips using the same important to make sure you do the hash verification when you include the timing someone could tamper with a bit of the ciphertext and potentially generate a valid timestamp if you detect such brute force apparently using an iv correctly is controversial for some some code generate random ivs and add them to your output for also perform the authentication making sure the encrypted data aesdemo const int encryption with random iv to and includes hash of plaintext for public static construct message with var msg new var hash using aes using enc var encbytes prepend iv to var res new return public static using aes var iv new probably could copy right to the byte but not using dec var decbytes verify var hash var existinghash new if throw new hash hash is var res new return static bool if return for i i if return return static aes salt may not be needed if password is if throw new must be at least 8 if throw new must be at least 8 var pdb new var key var aes return static int int using sha return public static void var password var salt new 0 var ct1 var ct2 var pt1 var pt2 now check try tamper detection catch tampering performact1 performact2 tampering message hash 46 at removing the random iv and the the type of how the first corresponding to is the without a simple example of passing a just encrypt and open to in the attack is easily even with cbc static void var buff new new var v var aes var encbytes var dec for i i for x x try catch 6598637501946607785 if the kind of id it could quite easily be changed to another you need to authenticate outside of your the message structure is unlikely to fall into place and can sorta act as a but why rely on something that could possibly you need to be able to rely on your crypto working correctly regardless of the

 dynamics reports sound like it is for it is a fully programmable reporting component for visual view the documentation on the api you can export the reports to any of our various including and excel and it also includes an end user designer control that you can embed into your own applications to let end users modify or create their own reports are stored in rdl the same xml dialect that reporting services uses in fact you can take any existing rdl files and open them in data dynamics in addition to compatibility with we add many more such as to consistently style your master pages for and several other built in controls such as a and to name a lets look at your requirements and see how data dynamics reports might solve invoked through code dynamics reports includes comprehensive on ideally invoked from code within a can use data dynamics reports in or it even support medium trust applications are report files that contain their own internal data query etc ideally so that we can push simple report files to the and it simply work where maintenance is not necessarily a developer dynamics reports uses standard rdl which includes all information bout how to retrieve data from your we also include an end user designer control to allow you to emebed a design environment for these standalone files into your own data from a database server based on parameters that we pass in dynamics reports includes comprehensive support for parameters get the from a through to pdf or similar dynamics reports supports exporting to and hope it works out for and let me know if you have any additional dynamics grapecity

 each provides the ability for a thread to or on when a method is the method uses its object instance as the in your the methods and are both and both are in the same class this means that any thread executing these methods will synchronize on a instance as its sequence of events which will cause a deadlock first thread started calls which is on the this means the thread must acquire the lock from this second thread started calls which is on the this means the thread must acquire the lock from this first thread started now calls and waits for the lock on to be second thread started now calls and waits for the lock on to be show the sequence of events in much more begins to execute in the main therad it thread creating two so so main thread starts its first new thread it thread with the code thread calls which is on the thread thus acquires the for the object and enters the time slice occurs here and the original thread gets a chance to do more main thread starts a second new thread it thread just like the first thread calls which is synchronized on the since has yet acquired the for the object thread successfully acquires this lock and enters the time slice occurs here and thread gets a chance to do more now calls with being a reference to the instance for this is the logical equivalent of a call of this method is on the the lock for this object has already been acquired and is held by another thread thread has to wait for the lock on to be the thread is put into a waiting allowing thread to execute now calls which in this instance is logically the same as the call to do it needs to acquire the lock for the but this lock is held by thread this thread is now put into a waiting you are now in a position where neither thread can both thread and thread are waiting for a lock to be but neither lock can be released without a thread making but neither thread can make progress without a lock being very often depend on a specific sequence of events which can make then difficult to debug since they can be difficult to	
 easiest and fastest way to do a or a set of not necessarily a they can be although a mentor is more can find these people when you participate in local software development or user group frequent these both offline and the amount of knowledge that you will learn is not to mention the benefit of being able to bounce ideas off of other and are likewise excellent book suggestions i suggest you go with code complete as it tackles on how to make your code sensible and which you certainly can use

 easiest way to do this is to simply run the xml through a command line utility to perform this always have a copy of available for stuff like indicate immediately if it parse your and thus indicate whether the encoding is correct or looking for a coded method to do simply load the xml into your xml parser of an encoding error will trigger a parser exception the encoding is parsing take by xdoc new use the load method to load the xml document from the specified	
 easiest way to do this would be to have a base argument which is not and then have the specific data types derive from could even make the templated version derive from the base class directly and just use those two then you store them as pointers in a does require having some sort of functions to access the argument values and perform any conversions as	
 easiest way to manage this is probably to emit dynamic css when the pages are based on the then everything is doing the job it is supposed to be doing and the server is doing the work of converting the settings into the appropriate the css doing this you can use appropriate attributes in the html and and and so and emit css that will cleanly format everything the way you

 elaborate butterworth and have already given the correct is defined by the sdk or the build so it does not use the implementation reserved is defined by the so it uses the underscore to place it in the namespace find a similar set of dual defines with nearly identical names and similar uses such as or maybe think that only the unicode ones get much of any use in their different though sometimes in these cases instead of the underscore version being defined the they are used to control what the crt headers tells the crt headers that crt names which can be either unicode or ansi as should map to the wide character variant does something similar for the sdk win32 apis to their the versions with the underscore are controlled by or used by the compiler the versions without the underscore are by teams outside of the of probably going to be a lot overlap due to compatibility with past versions and just general mistakes by one team or the find it confusing as hell and find that they are used nearly interchangeably in user code when you see one see the other defined in the same because if you need one you need the i think that you should the versions without the underscore writing the and make sure they both get defined via hearers or compiler switches as when defining that the sdk will define when building for the mac because the compiler kind of overstepping not sure what projects use a win32 api an a compiler targeting the mac maybe some version of office for the max or

 enables us to also configure file thus besides iis also invokes when requests have the following file extension is used to request user user controls be accessed how and why would anyone send a request to a user this extension is used for http but why would you want to request an page directly instead of registering this handler inside configuration file and enable it to be called when files with certain non ashx extensions are since there can be several http handlers how will know which handler to invoke if they all use ashx what does the requested ashx file perhaps a definition of a http handler i know how we register http handlers to be invoked when pages are but how do we register http handler for ashx this extension is used to request a global application why would we ever want to call i assume that when request is made for an object derived from httpapplication class is except this time no web page processing takes besides being able to request for is there any other reason why i would choose to request file with extension ashx files have to be they are basically a simpler for when you need the entire page life a common use is for retrieving dynamic images from a if i write a http i should put it in a file with extension and will build an httphandler object similarly to how it builds a page instance from if a hacker did try to make a request for one of these what would you want to you certainly want iis to treat it like a text file and send the source for your app down to the could do the same it does with file it registers these file types with iis so that it can explicitly prevent users from accessing these because you expect requests from the browser for a it mean you want that resource handled by the these extensions are also how picks up files to compile for the web site model then why also allow files to be directly and as far as i am these are not exposed to process any external book claims the two are mapped in appreciate your the extention is defined in a config file just not the its in the use the difference is that the class that handles a reads the page directive in the file to map the request to a class specified in that this saves you from having to put an explicit path in the for every handler that you which could result in a very long thought http handler class was defined inside but instead file with extension only contains page not sure if i understand this say we have ten http handlers we want to invoke by making a request to i assume for each http handler there will be specific file thus if request is made for then handler specified inside that file will be another must confess that still a bit unsure about ashx realize that by using it we can for example create where page directive will tell which class http to invoke when request is made for thus no need to register http handler in if you use http handlers that then they will only get invoked when requests are made for files with if i want http handler to be invoked for files with other such as then i will still need to register http handler in file mappings

 er we need to know about a team is the name and therefore we need a table to store the seed the only candidate key is team name so we will use that as the primary to keep things ncaa team names are unlikely to change over the course of a single tournament or contain duplicates so it should be an adequate table can be used to pair the teams into each of the match foreign keys to the will ensure that the teams exist and a primary key over these values ensures that teams are only matched up against each other foreign key to the table from the table will record the logically the winner would need to be one of the two teams participating in the match a check constraint against the primary key could ensure the outcome of a match up has been determined the seed could be retrieved from the team table in order to compare against other in order to determine subsequent match upon doing so an fk to the resulting match up can be written to the determining match ups in order to depict the progress of the tournament this data could probably be derived at any also modeled out the games of each match a game is identified by the match up it is a part of and a sequence number based on the order in which it took place during the match games have a winner from the team table score could be recorded in this table as

 example i can think of is an internal database at my company containing information on all it gets a nightly update from hr and has an web service on many other apps use the web service to populate things like pessimism is that the developer thought that repeated calls to the web service would be too slow to make repeated sql so what did he the application start event reads in the entire database and converts it all to objects in stored indefinitely until the app pool is this code was so it would take 15 minutes to load in less than 2000 if you inadvertently recycled the app pool during the it could take 30 minutes or because each web service request would start multiple concurrent for this new hires appear in the database the first day when their account was created and therefore would not be able to access most internal apps on their first couple twiddling their second level of pessimism is that the development manager want to touch it for fear of breaking dependent but yet we continue to have sporadic outages of critical applications due to poor design of such a simple

 fact that you can break the chain at any point differentiates the chain of responsibility pattern from the decorator decorators can be thought of as executing all at once without any interaction with the other links in a chain can be thought of as executing one at a because they each depend on the previous the chain of responsibility pattern when you can conceptualize your program as a chain made up of where each link can either handle a request or pass it up the i used to work with the win32 i would sometimes need to use the hooking functionality it hooking a windows message roughly follows the chain of responsibility when you hooked a message such as your callback function would be think of the callback function as the last link in the each link in the chain can decide whether to throw away the message or pass it up the chain to the next the decorator pattern had been used in that you would have been notified of the but you would be powerless to prevent other hooks from handling it as place the chain of command pattern is used is in game you can hook engine and other in the case of a game you want to simply add you want to add functionality and prevent the game engine from performing its default

 fairly new to nhibernate and have run into a strange inheritance chaining issue with my repository been using as a and following his examples been creating interfaces to define contracts for dao operations in the data schema working with is rather and after a little while i found myself duplicating a lot of the and methods were exactly the same after i added a generic parameter to the base for this would be the most basic interface for repository interface where entitytype void void void entitytype just talk about the add method from now for the sake of with the generic the implementations were all the void using session using transaction typing this same method body repeatedly the slight change of only bad design in my so i created an abstract base class call repositorybase which provides the implementation for since using an abstract instead of an i the interface for classes inheriting from repositorybase and am forced to make any derivation abstract as even though it seems more to use an using this crappy little entity class public guid id public string name do interface ientity1repository naughty this is abstract class entity1repositorybase public abstract just bothers it but it rubs me the wrong especially as the chain of with this particular schema could go quite so i guess my questions i just being stupid and anal retentive about there a design that i should be looking at looked at some other examples and approach seems simplest for novice in is it ok to use an abstract base to provide functionality instead of an

 file with a other answers have the easiest method is to create a lock file in the same directory as the you want to be able to access the same file over multiple pc the best solution i can think of is to just include the identifier of the machine currently writing to the data the sequence for writing to the data file would if there is a lock file present there is a lock see if the one owning it by checking that its content has my the just write to the data file then delete the lock not the just wait a second or a small random length of time and try the whole cycle there is no lock create one with my identifier and try the whole cycle again to avoid race condition that the lock file is really with the i would record a timestamp in the lock file and check whether older than a given timeout the timestamp is too then assume that the lock file is stale and just delete it as it would mea one of the pc writing to the data file may have crashed or its connection may have been you are in control the format of the data could be to reserve a structure at the beginning of the file to record whether it is locked or you just reserve a byte for this you could for that would mean the data file and that other values would represent the identifier of the machine currently writing to with adding a few things because jiri klouda correctly pointed out that uses that will result in the actual lock file being in an undetermined few ways to solve this the nfs directory with the or this is easy but completely guarantee data consistency between client and server though so there may still be issues although in your case it may be the lock file or data file using the the or this is supposed to disable caching will lower performance but will ensure be able to use to lock the data file but its implementation is spotty and you will need to check if your particular os actually uses the nfs locking it may do nothing at all the data file is then another client opening it for writing will and it seem to work on smb so probably best to just forget about use nfs and just use samba there is a article on the and why nfs is probably not the best answer to your usage will also find in this article various methods for locking solution is also a good if you want to keep things use nfs for files that are shared amongst multiple a small database server to save your data into and bypass the locking issues altogether or keep your current multiple data files system and just write a small utility to concatenate the may still be the safest and simplest solution to your

 fine to compare iterators which are from the same container as a for loop but this only makes sense if you are moving one or other iterators in either the increment part if the for loop statement or in the body of the for loop in this for loop you compare against but the for loop never changes this means that either there will be no iterations or the for loop will never you probably want to use and not for the and work for all for i iter starts where you want the loop to you may want something like for iter still learning we probably instructive to work through an algorithm like but you should be aware of which probably does what you final need to and i see incrementing iter or it in the outer for loop invalidating the logic in the later for the point in points to one past the end of a so you can use it for loop termination but you try to dereference an iterator which is to

 first guess would be differences between in vista and if you are using a cframewnd there is a gripper control in what would be your last pane in the far right of the status it looks as though changes in the may account for giving you a smaller i assume you are just seeing a smaller than you did you are not talking about smaller x and y at the same time are you have you may want to look for the correct version and deploy it with your or make your manifest reflect which version to i have a clear cut but themes are the only thing that come to since if i recall in the gripper was added on top of the status or the status bar was shrunk just enough to display suggestion you could use would be to detect your running version of and made the assumption of the gripper for the the gripper will be the same size as the vscroll so you can naturally remove that many from the last cell at and render text based on have to go home and fire up and see how it acts based on what you are saying have a vista vm handy to see what version of it has installed by but my guess they put some code in it to deal with the you have complete sample that would really make things easier on me i have to start digging for all my old vc6 generated code and go from interesting test would be to call getsystemmetrics on the pieces that we think could have an effect on and see how they differ from system to if you put vista into do you still see the same which machine is your dev vista or

 first search means that you process all of your starting direct before going to deeper bfs is implemented with a queue which stores a list of nodes that need to be start the algorithm by adding your start node to the then you continue to run your algorithm until you have nothing left to process in the you dequeue an element from the it becomes your active when you are processing your active you add all of its children to the back of the you terminate the algorithm when you have an empty you are dealing with a graph instead of a you need to store a list of your processed nodes so you enter into a you reach node 7 you have a matching path and you can stop doing the bfs for that recursive meaning that you simply add its children to the to avoid loops and to know the exact path as you do your recursive bfs pass up the already visited

 first thought would have that objects are but if you get some input as string and have to search it in a small collection of guids changing it might be faster to store them as searching a string in a you have to parse the string error checking create the get the hash do the hash lookup and one final comparison of the guid searching a string in a you have to build the hash of the string faster than building the lookup the hash and do one string for you expect many guids not to be in the the hash comparison will fail often an you even have to do the string comparison takes slightly more time than the from point 1 you already have as input because you did some on the input of course far better to reuse them as index in the from point of view of design clarity is far more important than performance in of all you should use structures and only change if you really run into performance troubles profiling shows that you get an advantage out of the string

 four weeks of learning for the my first useful application is almost i still need to save several instance variables whenever the current view is changed and to reload them when the view is have no trouble loading variables with basic c types like and but am having difficulty with a linked list made of linked list consists of memory accessed by three and element consists of a a a pointer to a nested linked list and some first attempt was to do the following in the loading will contain the values to be variables loaded is a class with methods to retrieve its instance methods are named after the values they placed a debug point at the end and all of the variables had the correct actually accessing the values in the code so in the console resulted in i changed the linked list loading lines to the last nestedpointer variables loaded from thelist if next return problem now was that the pointers were all pointing to individual linked so i wrote methods to retrieve the start and end locations of the linked list referred to by question is it necessary to use methods such as to allocate memory for a loaded linked there a more efficient way to maintain the relationship between and than by searching through the list using the and there something wrong with the techniques behind the loading code i have without i have no with i still get i want to know if these messages are tied to the loading code or if to the way i have handled object allocation throughout the rest of my in may a linked list be from a file efficiently using

 function does not cause the current thread to yield and does not release the all it does is restart one thread that has suspended itself on the condition via this just means the awakened thread is available for it cause it to execute the will schedule it sometime in the just because the has been awakened and is contending for the that mean going to get the mutex mutexes are not necessarily fair to all threads that have requested according to the man locks the given if the mutex is currently it becomes locked and owned by the calling and returns so the can spin in its loop several happily unlocking and relocking the mutex several times before being swapped out by the this means the will only get a chance at the mutex if the scheduler happens to interrupt the during the brief time in which it has released the achieve the output you both threads will need to control their execution with a condition and signal each other before suspending this may or may not be what you actually want to do with your real it really matter what order you created the threads creating a thread does not yield the creating so the main thread will probably create both threads before either gets and the thread scheduler is free to schedule either one of them for execution if the does run first on your that just happens to be the implementation behavior on your platform and is not something that should be relied

 gcc on macos x but the the example with works or my adaptation of it it appears you can have as many global typedefs of as you like i had 5 with the version in first typedef inside main is it is a new scope and can define a new meaning for the c99 rationale a typedef could be redeclared in an inner block with a declaration that explicitly contained a type this rule avoided the ambiguity about whether to take the typedef as the type name or a candidate for in implicit int declarations are not so this anbiguity is not possible and the rule is no longer discussing standard it also c89 committee decided to make library headers that they should includable any number of and includable in any this which widespread existing may necessitate some protective wrappers within the headers for redefinitions of to ensure that such protective wrapping can made to and to ensure proper scoping of standard headers may only be included outside of any redefinitions of a in a single scope the file is not allowed in that the multiple external redefinitions of is probably either a feature of gcc or a bug a you change to you get many more

 give you some food for thought you could look at something like live not saying the answer for you but the storage model it uses may the mesh you download a small windows service onto each windows machine you want in your mesh and then nominate folders on your system that are part of the when you copy a file into a live mesh folder which is the exact same operation as copying to any other foler on your system the service takes care of syncing that file to all your other participating an example i keep all my code source files in a mesh folder and have them synced between work and i have to do anything at all to keep them in sync the action of saving a file in notepad or any other app initiates the you have a web site with frequently changing files that need to go to multiple and presumably mutliple authors for those then you could put the mesh service on each web server and as authors changed or removed files the updates would be pushed as far as the authors go they would just be saving their files to a normal old folder on their

 giving everything under the directory full you have enabled all of the example scripts that ship with git in normally with their execute bits when you try to the now executable sample script tries to run to format the commit as a this is what you are trying to i suggest you to so that the hook scripts do not resetting the hook permissions gets you back the condition where you had the problem try the commit with the which is supposed to bypass the hook also some minor checks on the commit this may be a but i still see why you had the initial the code looks very straightforward i see how it could try to execute that hook if not that fails in the same then i would think that the system is not handling permissions properly pretty	
 gmail not but it and you control it or test simplest is to start a separate thread or fork a subprocess to send the there likely will arise problems from using and i really have no input on that the but from a design just no reason to make the user wait for that process to a testing this might be where a proxy pattern might come in it might be easy for you to directly invoke gmail to send a make it put in a proxy object that does the mailing for you that you can turn off heaven knows you for testing purposes make gmail just make your team follow what happens in the event of an email malfunction by turning off the proxy and trying to complete an if you are doing it then all the plagues mentioned here by other posters will rear their if you are doing it you should be able to allow it to fail silently the your perspective there should be enormous logging statements and text messages in the middle of the night and possibly a mild electric current arcing across the surface of

 going to say on rails is a complete and basically closed technology stack from prototype for javascript to rails for orm on the now this can be good because it means that any ruby programmer coming onto a project will know what to but bad as well because fads look at the rise of jquery over the last 2 jquery is it dominant javascript now you can use jquery with ruby but the fit is a bit awkward since basically throwing away your prototype of the reasons and java have been enduring is that the tchnology stack is basically pluggable so it really matter what fad is because fad will of those two i would pick	
 going to streamline your regex for the purposes of this into what may work but i may be wrong since i tested it on any real say sitting in the base directory of your you could start will get you all separated by null which is necessary in case any of them have xargs sed should get you most of the way it will find all the then for each run sed to replace the without the tag this actually touch your it will just send your code to your the suppresses normal and the p after the regex part tells it to print only lines that if your results look then you take the big which is replacing the files should definitely back up all your files before attempting xargs sed should about get the job i have no php files lying around that use that so on your own to figure it out from but hopefully the mechanics of getting things done are a bit clearer all the files with that list of files to does some command on the files one at a and the syntax to put your regex magic to

 good i think i have seen them more often than not it is an effort to fix performance problems by someone that is too darn lazy to troubleshoot their way down to the cause of those performance problems or even researching whether there actually is a performance in many of these cases i wonder if it just a case of that person wanting to try a particular technology and desperately looking for a nail that fits their shiny new a recent architect comes to me with an elaborate proposal to vertically partition a key table in a fairly large and complex he wants to know what type of development effort would be necessary to adjust for the the conversation went like why are you considering what is the problem you are trying to table x is too we are partitioning it for performance what makes you think it is too the consultant said that is way too many columns to have in one and this is affecting users have reported intermittent slowdowns in the xyz module of the how do you know the width of the table is the source of the that is the key table used by the xyz and it is like 200 it must be the but module xyz in particular uses most of the columns in that and the columns it uses are unpredictable because the user configures the app to show the data they want to display from that it is likely that of the time wind up joining all the tables back together anyway which would the consultant said it is too wide and we need to change who is this i know we hired a nor did they talk to the development team at we hired them this is part of a proposal they but they insisted we needed to this uh so the consultant who sells database services thinks we need a database conversation went on and on like i took another look at the table in question and determined that it probably could be narrowed with some simple normalization with no need for exotic partitioning of course turned out to be a moot point once i investigated the performance problems and tracked them down to two indexes on a few few rogue data analysts who were key the querying database directly course the architect is still pushing for a vertical partitioning of the table hanging on to the he even bolstered his case by getting a proposal from another database consultant who was able to determine we needed major design changes to the database without looking at the app or running any performance

 good to notice that some cases use of operator can lead to the expected because the way how java handles string literals are interned during compilation so when you write for example in two classes and compare those strings with you could get which is expected according to when you compare same strings they have same when the first one is string literal defined through am string and second is constructed during runtime with keyword like am string the operator returns because both of them are different instances of the right way is using says only if two objects are the same instance of object have same memory i updated this post due comments below which are somehow originally i declared that interning is side effect of jvm although it certainly save memory resources was what i meant by it is mainly feature of

 got the idea of column families right basically just a hint to hbase to store and replicate these items together for faster you put two column families in the same table and always have different keys to access then really the same thing as having them in two separate you only gain by having two column families in the same table that are accessed via the same if i have columns for the total number of pageviews for a given web the number of unique views for the same the browser the user uses to view the and their internet i can decide that i want the first two to be a column family and the last two to be another column here all four are accessed by the same namely the web site in so gaining by having them in the same in different tables i would end up having to do a operation on the two i really know the numbers though so i really tell you how slow the operation is i recall hbase having a join since and what the tipping point is where splitting them into separate tables outweighs having them in the same table vice this all depends on the data trying to so if you would never need to join across the you would want to keep them in separate tables since you could argue not that related to each other in the first

 great way to do this is to use but first you have to transform your xml data using an xsl stylesheet into something matches your database something that dbunit can make sure you use a programmed xsl transformer to do the transformation as it will allow you to work with larger sets of data than a one without increasing the size of the stack for java you need an example of how to use dbunit checkout

 guy that did aforge did a fairly good job but not commercial great to learn from but you can tell he was learning too so he has some pretty serious mistakes like assuming the size of an image instead of using the correct bits per not knocking the i respect the heck out of him for learning all that and show us how to do i think a now or at least about to be so really smart just not a commercially usable library has its own weirdness when working with fourier transforms and complex if not it outputs the fourier transform in human viewable format which is nice for humans if you want to look at a picture of the transform but not so good when you are expecting the data to be in a certain format normal i could be mistaken about that but i just remember there was some weirdness so i actually went to the original code they used for the fourier stuff and it worked much also had some other funkyness i like when dealing with the data from the i remember what it was i just know it was much easier to get what i wanted out of the exocortex dsp not a mathematician or engineer to those guys it might make perfect i use the fft code yanked from which is based without anything else and it works i know not but started looking at using fftw and this guy already made a wrapper so i was going to check it out but actually used it i know if you are doing this for school or work but either way there is a great free lecture series given by a stanford professor on itunes

 had network issues causing corruption in an access database on our shared drive and i spent a lot of time cleaning up corrupted rows from a couple specific memo fields in particular were a good indication of corruption because they are not stored inline like the rest of the data but are kept in a separate i could open up the corrupted table in datasheet mode and try to determine which rows were corrupted by putting the focus on a corrupted memo there was corruption then i would immediately get an int and date columns would have odd values but would not actually throw any errors when i read their is why cycling through all records and fields in the database as shown in the vba from a previous answer makes some sense but will perform most reliably only if you have memo field

 had similar problem with much more tables we can indeed avoid making cursor for each rows to be the only cursor is for looping the list of the table names we are also going to need dynamic sql for the whole operation is extremely compared to the traditional cursor loop trick is to insert the relevant rows into the same and then update its fk column to its how we can collect the mass is by making use of keyword during the and save them into a temporary table later we join with the tables involved for updating the their know table tbl id refid invoicedetail into price from invoicedetail custid 808 denormalized original populate temporary table with a list of newly created auto running our job is just to make this insert query as only drawback of this method is that we need on each table we must key of its own by the name of in this case we need to to become to become and a new column int primary in denormalized for tables listed with the table will require the current front end application to populate this new helper an will make our work a bit more column called defined int this column is for making the relationship of rows belong to as a copy of list all table names into table tbl sysname primary fktbl fkcol depth select select select love to go abstract as to just populating column during insertion and dynamically populate the rest of the columns by updating them with the result of recursive cte of however that could be beside the assume we have a table with the list of table names ordered by the way it should be loop the table in a int 808 original custid to copy tbl from where fktbl is dbcursor cursor local for select depth from order by dbcursor next from dbcursor into 0 set case when 0 then else end as set set set into from where print remap if third level set set from join as rf on and where as print if 0 select id from fetch next from dbcursor into from order by from table the content of function declare set select from where and non return am sure we can further improve these scripts to be far more but for the sake of solving the this would be the minimum

 handlers are traditionally called with the elements registered to as context this is what jquery easiest option for you would be to use ability to handle event myclass is the initial call updatesum with correct does something other possibility is to use closures to define the updatehandler inside the myclass save this as that so we can access it from the anonymous var that does something is a working example what one of the other answers tried to it works because the anonymous function can always access the variables in the surrounding function but it only works if the function is really defined in the function that has as local	
 handles this there is an operation to get immediate and a operations to get all would you consider that as an summarize the navigation functions each correspond to an axis type in xpath if the navigation function selects the axis name is if the navigation function selects the axis name is used with node there are functions and correspond to descendants returning either an xelement or an exception case is not surprisingly the most used the children in this is the axis used if no axis is for the navigation functions are not and but rather and is a subtype of include things like html but also html cdata or xelements are a type of but refer specifically to html xelements therefore have a tag and support the navigation its not as easy to chain navigations in as it is the problem is that navigation functions return collection while the navigation functions are applied to consider the xpath expression which selects a table tag as an immediate child then any descendant table data i think this would look like or allows one to call the navigation functions on a the equivalent to the above looks something like

 handmade jvm would be a great way to learn about virtual machines in the issues of program language design the jvm and the nitty gritty of parsing and so you choose to take it in that you could also explore which is where it can get and you can take research papers and implement their being if less interested in the long and arduous task of creating a vm from you might want to modify an existing open source vm like it will show you what a virtual machine but not necessarily how java code works in is a clean room implementation of the java virtual plus the associated class libraries needed to provide a java runtime you could study the but dive in to implementing more interesting

 hard to give a single all encompassing answer but the high level approach is at this is the approach prioritize your goals and then try to identify the costs of reaching those your costs will essentially boil down to you want whatever is working to keep if you have something that is and there is no good reason to rewrite keep some of your existing code needs updating to do its then you are looking at maintenance at this point you need to determine if a rewrite will improve maintenance costs enough to be worth forget to subtract testing and debugging of new bugs because there will be new dismiss working code just because it is your existing code is sufficiently you can usually chip away at it one piece at a rewrite the high maintenance components you will be doing new development in then you should be fine working with com components until you have enough justification to replace

 hard to say without being able to see your suspect you are running into robustness issues with your floating point have you considered using integer points or doing some kind of robustness enhancement like eliminating common bits in the floating point is an open source geometry library called geos which might be useful to test your data set out there are also algorithms in geos to perform snap rounding to an integer grid and eliminate common bits to help you determine if you are encountering a robustness of further note is how geos computes the intersection using duality in homogenous space i quite tell if the dot product projection technique you describe is mathmatically equivalant an my favorite solution to compute intersections in a graph of edges is to use a sweepline in conjunction with a monotone chain of when you use monotone you can eliminate a lot of edge intersection since chains never intersect this is what geos

 have a design conundrum that i could use some feedback so hoping my fellow sharepoint experts can help me work this am managing a set of projects in a single moss list where the column will be treated as a least in my for related each project will have associated with it a set of defined deliverables to 37 separate activities throughout each and each deliverable will track one significant activity that is recommended to complete during the initial thinking was to define the 37 deliverables in a separate so that each deliverable had not just a but linking to a separate where the user can find more info on how to accomplish the to give a quick explanation of what the deliverable means having to send the user off to a separate server to get any to help us filter and sort the deliverables into the order in which required to be to identify the primary project role that owns completion of the i would create individual items in another list each of which was associated with the project and the item in the lookup so that we could track additional these date when deliverable was finished a from which the user can choose states such as or in text to record more on what was done and one major problem with this approach is that best practices guidance strongly discourages moss lists with 2000 items in the even if we never added more deliverables to each afraid that scale beyond 54 projects how many in very short creating multiple instances of list3 is theoretically but strikes me as a nightmare to automate my set of tracked projects first alternative i can think of is to 37 additional columns in the projects plus the x columns needed to enable the and fields that the users will need to track for each plus having to manage a brittle of each of the spd forms web part pages that like to use to the ui for all this data entry data alternative someone suggested to me is to create for each and list the deliverables in a single list in the seems awfully heavyweight to and considering this only as my last would any of you pull this off in moss relying on an outside or any code that would have to be installed to the is there some trick to making this that obvious from the usual moss list is there some hidden feature of moss i should some neat aspect of sharepoint designer i discovered i to believe that many others have faced this same and have figured out way to make it appreciate any ideas you folks can suggest thanks in which would you choose additional or a separate linked

 have a friendly argument going on with a about and my personal opinion is that a compiled web application would run more than the same project that would be written in my friend i do not have any solid data that i can use to back up my does i tried to google for answers to try and find evidence to prove him wrong but most of the time the debate turned into which platform it is better to develop security for the sake of this argument i really care about any of would like to know what stack overflow community thinks about the raw of websites in general that are developed in with mvc versus exactly the same website developed with anyone have any practical examples in scenarios comparing the performance of the two realize for some of you this may very well be an irrelevant and maybe stupid but it is an and i would still like to hear the answers of the fine people here at of code versus	
 have a function getslope which takes as parameters 4 doubles and returns another double calculated using this given parameters in the following double double double problem is that when calling this function with arguments for returned result this is not a good result for my have calculated the slope using mathematica and the result for the slope for the same parameters with more digits for result returned by my program is not good in my further i do not understant how does the program returns starting from that this is the approximate result for the can i get the good result for my you in print the result using the command may be that my parameters are maybe not as i read them from another program computes a after i read this parameters fromt his graph i have just displayed them to see their value but maybe the displayed vectors have not the same internal precision for the calculated do not know it is really some numerical errors the graph from which i am reading my parameters is some numerical libraries written in are no opengl is used for this loss of precision when dividing

 have a function of the other function does some work and returns only when the condition is the condition has been expressed as a functor argument because i want to supply different conditions at different call this is fairly straightforward to use but it requires declaring lots of little throwaway functions or functor which like to avoid if been looking at lambda library for possible ways to do away with but i think missing something i just get it to do what i case stumped me at the i have a collection called the condition that after is when the of that collection reaches a certain i want my functor to return true when and false but been having trouble expressing that in lambda best that been able to come up with thus far at least though it is ge size other entry to the size is 0 and even though the size increases during the course of the calls to always seem to get a size of tracing it through is a bit tricky through while it does appear to be calling each time is it appear to be calling what fundamental thing have i completely messed is there a simpler way of expressing this sort of thing still keeping the code as inline as ideally like to get it as close as possible to the equivalent code return other other lambda collection size

 have a large sql server table that looks something like table stores an entry for each page of a number of image this is done to enable the table to represent images where each page is represented by a different and image files that contain the pages within the same when i am dealing with a the value of the fspath column is exactly duplicated for each page within the same document which is eating up a lot of space table alone is currently it seems very wasteful to be duplicating the data in this but i been able to find an alternate solution that satisfied usage pattern for this table is dominated by lookups based on the primary key for the path other but i also need to be able to efficiently handle insertion of new data and occasional i create a lookup table for the path elements and insert an path element id into the pages table i would need to index it both by the id and by the which would hurt the scenario where there is a distinct path piece for each and complicate the insertion of new data where the path may or may not exist in the lookup deletion of any row in the main pages table would require that i clean up the associated path entry if it is no longer had been hoping that i could create an updateable view of the joined tables and let sql server do the magic for but i get the view or function is not updatable because the modification affects multiple base trying to perform an there a reasonable way to do this that just or am i out of with duplicated data in sql

 have a problem trying to solve with biztalk and was hoping you would have some thoughts on the best way to solve i am loading in a flat file using a flat file this file contains records if a number of different type 1 records are parent the rest of the types all link to the parent records using various foreign i am looking to develop a transform that will take the message created by loading the flat file records of all and transform that to a message which is the result of joining all the records based on the foreign each record in the resulting message would therefore have columns from all of the record types as the message records will be the result of a the flat file might contain the following message after the transform might contain records like type1 type2 type3 type4 type1 type2 type4 have been looking into the options for achieving this but was hoping some people might have advice on the way to i have tried splitting the original message into messages with records of each type then using a map to join them i had difficultly achieving this as i sure what functoids to inserting the child records into a sql database so that the additional columns in the parent records can be populated using sql lookup this was a bit slower than i would have hoped and has the additional dependency of using a using dts to load the transform it into the format and writing out a file in the joined format for biztalk to this is simple and fast but using advice on how to go forward to make the best use of biztalk for this would be biztalk 2006 to join

 have a program in which i want to be able to store certain data allocated on disk for reduced memory usage and first thought was to write my own custom allocator which managed the content of files on the but i want to see what alternatives there are looked into custom memory allocators and topics on object serialization but there are subtle both good and when adapting those principles to managing the address space of a this is accessed only through io functions rather than are only size of a file is not so it should grow when needed rather than being large and my it is acceptable to existing pointers after the data is not of a fixed most database implementations seem not well what is the best approach for this should i implement a simple memory allocator which treats a file as the im using on embedded implemented my own memory manager which uses buddy memory allocation and block sizes of powers of satisfied that it is correct and does not coalesces free and can do a the problem as there is quite a bit of internal and external not an expert in this field and although i find it fascinating still a i wonder if there are any other implementations that have done the same or similar surely i cant be the only helpful but so far incompatible topics i havent used mmap it addresses the file but not the management of the file address i have a reluctance to use boost libraries at the interesting but doesnt address variable size memory lea memory has very good insights into issues with memory but not in a position to try and make my own based dynamic memory

 have a robot that uses an optical mouse as a position as the robot moves it is able to track change in x and y directions using the the mouse also tracks which direction you are moving ie negative x or positive these values are summed into separate x and y the robot rotates in place and moves forward so the movement of the robot is ideally in straight lines the mouse tracking can pickup deviations if you veer at particular a particular set of movements of the robot would be rotate 45 move 3 inches rotate 90 move 10 inches rotate move 5 inches rotate 10 move 1 inch each time the mouse x and mouse y registers give the real distances you moved in each if i want to repeat the movement set going from a to d how can i do this using the information i have already i know i can basically sum all the angles and distances i feed into it but this would prove to be inaccurate if there were large errors in each movement how can i use the raw information from my a friend provided an idea that i could continuously sine and cosine the mouse values and calculate the final vector but not really sure how this would problem is that the mouse only gives relative readings so rotating or moving you are potentially erasing so what i am wondering is how you can implement the algorithm so it can continually track changes to give you a shortest path if you moved in zigzags to get there algorithm for

 have a three question i have is for when the user is entering data into the formatting code when the row gets the focus changes the value field to a dropdown combobox if the testcode is of type the drop down has a list of all the system codes that have a parentsyscodeid of the when the user chooses a value in the list it translates into a number which goes into the value datatype of the field is i made it an integer instead of a string because when reporting it is easier to do calculations and sorting if it is a there are issues if you are putting value into a string as when the system was being designed they only wanted numbers in users now want to put strings into the value field as well as from a list and wondering what the best way of doing that would it be bad practice to convert the field over to a string and then store both strings and integers in the same there are different issues related to this one but not sure if any are a really big i add another column into the table of string datatype and if the test is a string type then put the data the user enters into the different option would be to create a relationship to another table and if the user types in a string into the value field it adds it into the new table with a key of a have any interesting of storing a number and text in same sql

 have a web project which is migrating from classic asp to and would like to redirect requests from the old such the new a fairly long there will be classic asp pages running in parallel with with individual pages being replaced by their versions over where i want to redirect from the old pages to the new ones to keep users from receiving 404 and also to keep the accumulated pagerank on the question how would you do the redirection logic from the classic asp to the new the obvious solution is to replace with some simple vbscript that redirects to but in the long run i want to get rid of the old so i would like to implement the redirection in such a way that they will exist also after the site is completely running in option would be to map the extension to and implement the redirection as an but i guess there is no way of making the classic asp engine run after the request has been passed to to deal with link redirects when migrating from classic asp to

 have a whole lot to add to the great answers so but here are a few things to consider and to make this is the catch all it is easy to assume things that are region or language specific and it is hard to notice these very careful with string there are some such as which have letters that are similar to others visually but which are pseudo translation as a smoke if you read your translated strings from a resource create a pseudo translated version of the file that is still understandable to you but which stresses the capacity and capability of every translatable string in the for pad out a string like with something like so that it is as wide as your allowance for translated then you can test to verify that every string will display extra credit for also sticking in the most complex character likely to be rendered to verify that it displays correctly in all make assumptions about keyboard may be a great control set of directional keys for qwerty but hard coding that makes it if not to use for people with other keyboard various date then test them i have seen issues due to something as small as a different format for in regional the also comes up a but every setting here can various number then test them you do not want to depend on decimal or thousands for with and without a user logged in to the this may be more windows but it is very easy to get a component on the server configured such that it uses the logged in regional settings while a user is logged in and a default regional setting when the user is not logged this can cause intermittent with various regional and language as an not only does windows have regional and language but ie has its own language the behavior of an ie client with listed first may not always be the same as one with listed for sure your translator understands the business and the then cross check with someone be very careful any time you use application specific if your program uses specific words to mean something special in the make sure they are translated in a similar way in every including in the help if you have specific language you might even go so far as to translate such words ahead of time and make sure they translate poorly in the target this is more of a product research but it can make a difference in what words are used in the and it is easier on everyone if those words are in place from the you also want to avoid idioms that may not translate i had more to say than i

 have a windows forms application that was developed in visual studio 2005 and deployed to an iis server via upgraded to vs2008 so i decided to upgrade and redeploy the application i ran the upgrade manually changed the target runtime to removed all of the old publish files from the deployment and published the can launch it with no problem on my but when others launch it they get an the application is improperly contact the application vendor for a button on the error here are some of the version language runtime that the clr is is a summary of the details of these errors are listed later in the activation of host resulted in following failure messages were exception reading manifest from host the manifest may not be valid or the file could not be manifest xml signature is not no signature was present in the sign the a completely internal departmental i suspect that the problem the lack of a that is using the wrong and that the runtime handle the but if the i figure out how to get it to use the thought maybe the older version was so i had the user run that cleared the cache application did a full reload the next but it solve the anybody had a problem like this upgrading a clickonce app from to any idea what my problem could deployment error on upgraded

 have an application that stores a sparse this matrix has entries that mostly exist around the main diagonal of the i was wondering if there were any efficient algorithms existing that can efficiently handle sparse matrices of this this would be a generic implementation where each matrix entry can be a in response to a i say mostly around the main diagonal i mean that the characteristics of most of the matrices will be that most entries are clustered off of the main diagonal but there could be zeroes close to the diagonal and there could be values far out from the i want something efficient for cases will i be using this i need to be able to have efficient access to all values in a row or all values in a the values stored would be boolean an example would all true values in a foreach column a true appears in set all the entries of the column to all false values in a set the entry to was all done with linked lists previously but was very confusing to i was hoping that with a sparse matrix i could improve the algorithm but finding the type of sparse matrix algorithm has proved thanks for the responses thus far way to store a sparse matrix in

 have an interesting problem coming up soon and started to think about the the more i think about the more i get frightened because i think going to scale horribly unless i can get having trouble getting smart about this a simplified description of the have n polygons n can be huge that are stored as a list of m vertices m is on the order of what i need to do is for each polygon create a list of any vertices that are shared among other polygons of the polygons as surrounding regions of sometimes the regions but up against each i see something like i vertex polygon j 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 5 3 1 6 3 1 7 3 mean that vertex 1 in polygon 1 is the same point as vertex 2 in polygon and vertex 2 in polygon 1 is the same point as vertex 3 in polygon likewise vertex 5 in polygon 1 is the same as vertex 1 in polygon we can assume that polygons never the closest they get is touching at the and that all the vertices are integers make the equality easy to only thing i can thing of right now is for each polygon i have to loop over all of the polygons and vertices giving me a scaling of which is going to be very bad in my i can have very large files of so i even store it all in so that would mean multiple reads of the my pseudocode so to for j to for to for to if end end end assuming that this has come up in the graphics community spend much time so i know the any shared vertices among

 have an owner of a project a as finding it just you have a couple of my favourite would be to declare independence they want the responsibility of being the owner you take the responsibility you clearly understand the try grabbing send a few pithy emails outlining the new structure do not ask for just do it that will shake them up a answers you get an owner available you have to work around the owners but you can demand to know that schedule in for developers like between to 1 qa people expect between 0 and with it being much more likly to be if you get a dedicated tester go straight to the users you are the new owner build a brains trust of early qa users and subvert the answers based on projects in 20	
 have an page that is interacting with a business i want to continuously update controls on my page based on user entered update the calculations are embedded in business logic but simple enough to reproduce thought of three ways to accomplish update the page using i want to do this because i want to risk floating point math problems where the values on the page match the values calculated by the business class properties are calculated fields on changes and force the user to click a this is a poor user experience and wiring up javascript to controls is an ajax set data entry controls to and handle the event for the textchanged for third method seems cleanest to provides a nice user and allows me to interact directly with my business class that stored in session question is this a good idea a common are there better ways to accomplish done work for a few years and i have a prejudice against looked at the size of the request and currently negligible at the site will be low use but we may have a small number of users with in general but times are update an page using

 have been asking a lot of questions about a project i have been working on here is the scenario i am in and any help or point in the right direction would help a is a network program built with a server and multiple each client has a gui which must act according to commands sent from the each client is wrapped within a class called this has a gui and a main and the server has a main method only at this class was created in the main thread like public void new was working until i realized that the entire class was now executing in the when i wait for commands from the server the entire gui locks up until that command is sent and proper actions are as you can this is a horrible design and proved to be a real pain of a coding environment when every time you want to check for something you must find some crazy work around so that the gui still remains i must check for the commands from the server in a separate thread and run the gui components in the my second implementation had two classes one for the gui and one for the the idea was that the had a variable that held the gui so that i could access the gui from the something like public gui and then start this gui inside of the public void new work because inside of the new object refers to the not the can i communicate between the class in one thread and the corresponding gui class in the edt between the edt and main

 have either contributed to or implemented coding practices for sql server in several you can spend days researching what others have done but and you can probably use pieces but i find each environment to be completely a high would suggest separating function from form as much as what do i there are some best practices that can be tested and documented to your specific environment and application such as when to use temp tables over large no dynamic sql query these can totally vary depending on hardware and then there are other standards that are more opinion naming use of version the latter group can get pretty political really it is also a good idea to start small implement a little at a outside vendors i have found it impractical to influence until there is a performance impact explicit query hints that cause huge table then it is most effective to provide data and get them to patch if there is some sort of service contract i see how you can enforce note that they may be writing for multiple versions platforms and want the code as flexible as

 have encountered a strange packet is how the error is error when i run an automated bulk test on some of my java code and i hope that someone has either encountered this error before or can point me in the right do not encounter this error when testing my code via junit unit tests or from the i only encounter this error on my automated bulk a little bit about my bulk for some inputs my code will run for a long time to be but in order to speed up the results to a more reasonable time frame creating a new thread to run each individual test so that i can stop the test after some given maximum elapsed that both the test and the actual code need to connect to the same database instance to load the actual code uses a single connection to read from the database is not still trying to figure out the best way for the test to connect to the database this first thought was that i am doing something unfriendly in the way i close my test thread to quit the run calling the deprecated since my actual code is not an there is no way to kill the thread built after a few stopped my jdbc connection throws one packet error followed by exceptions for the rest of the tried all of these with the same the same connection that code one new connection an reuse that same second connection for and recreate the test connection every time i a new connection for each test works until i max out my connection have determined that of the two and the connection is the one that throws the compliance jdbc driver 9 db am i doing is there a different way i should handle my do i need to my connection just to run a bulk what causes the packet thin invalid packet lenght

 have four small utility applications that i have written in delphi that every once in awhile i want to use in a way that makes them as if they are all one mostly to make switching back and forth between them it would be for to be able to insert them as containers inside a or something along those makes a neat little component that does something similar with tform allowing them to be inserted inside another container in a delphi application acembeddedform but i see any way to do this with four separate applications unless i build a fifth application with this end result in and compile in all the forms of the original four could also imagine wanting to or embed some other application as well for this possible in things are and if would it be super and require massive amounts of windows api thinking the respective answers to these are probably and but hoping the answers are and thought i would ask just to be i am dreaming here from a programming and this is way more work than any recommendations for utilities that make switching back and forth between a standard set of three or four applications simpler than it normally is in containing another app inside your own

 have just installed pmd to analyze my java really nice highly i got a few errors empty method in an abstract class should be abstract checked out pmd documentation and the explanation developer may rely on this empty implementation rather than code the appropriate i think i understand the reason behind this code style but consider the following i have an abstract class called this class has a boolean method with default whether to delete its related entities upon only a few of the derived classes override this default behavior to i remove the default implementation and force all deriving classes to declare their you really think this pattern is such a bad pmd treats a method with single return statement as method in an abstract

 have large sql server 2008 very often have to run massive data imports into the databases that take a couple during that time everyone read and small write speeds slow down a looking for a solution where maybe we setup one database server that is used for bulk writing and then two other database servers that are setup to be read and maybe have small writes made to the goal is to maintain fast small reads and writes while the bulk changes are anyone have an idea of a good way to accomplish this using sql server is a good sql server 2008 solution for handling massive writes so that they slow down reads for users of the	
 have made a code review for a project i noticed that many business entitities and data access components were created from scratch while not having a business demand for implementing complex were related to the data access at the architecture that is used i recommended to introduce a code generator like codesmith in combination with tech lead liked the idea but he said that introducing this would be risky because the team is in the middle of the development stage and the project is too it preferable to introduce a codegen at this stage topic is not about which code gen tool must be but more about timing when to introduce it or about introducing it or code generators in a could this be a

 have much experience making games but having a loop to control all animation is a fundamental aspect of game most simple 2d games only have 1 loop to render most of its my experience a good way to render a whole bunch of stuff is to have a collection of all the entities in your game in one place and just loop over this collection passing the graphics object to each will allow each entity to draw itself onto the graphics although this is just one way to do entities for entity e entities g

 have nested sortable list that can have items dynamically added or removed and can be nested on a new ul element is injected into whatever li element is selected to be the the initial state of the list is something like the using mootools to do the etc and it works but what having trouble doing is resetting the position text correctly on every css selector i try to use also includes of the children rather than just the li elements that belong in the list and not any belonging to assume that except for and each li element in all lists is identical to all is there a selector for getting only the immediate is there another way to do tried some child selectors like the ones will select li are a child of a not just the does the same is the function that currently having run when an item is dropped handle the which works just updating the note that it is also mootools drop var poscount a changing any item order on the main level will renumber everything even the changing any item on a sublist will give the correct numbers for that but cause the parent lists to incorrectly count all child li elements in i feel like this is an ugly but it drop var ulcount var elid var poscount selector for targeting only immediate children and not other identical

 have no idea why someone downvoted this it seems a perfectly valid question to maybe they just had their coffee yet this seem to be asking what iunknown and idispatch have to do with i will try to give a brief com component exposes a common iunknown has the methods and and are used to support reference so that when every reference to an object has been released the object will be is kind of like version of the operator in it is used by client code to see if the iunknow pointer they have actually points to an object of another like or every com component must implement but most com libraries will implement this for you automatically so when you are writing com code you typically have to write any code to get you get it for are kind of like just like in real life two people can have exactly the same in com two com components can also have the same for you can have 2 libraries that both implement the idog but they may do totally different you should still be able to have both libraries installed on your machine and distinguishing between the two is what guids are used a guid is a globally unique meaning that when you generate in theory no other person on earth at any othher point in time will ever be able to create the same so in addition to a every com object and has a is another base interface much like but unlike iunknown which is required for every com idispatch is and provides special functionality that many but not all com objects things like supporting certian language features and making your object easier to use by most com object expose this com they must be registered in

 have not used the but i believe those lines are error they would be going to instead of standard and so they are going directly to your terminal instead of through the they be filtered by your sed you could filter them by merging your standard error and standard output but looks like not sure because you are missing the you are trying to call find is returning all of the files and notes on what you might want to looks like has a for you may want to of the find you do wish to use a you can limit it to only files using instead of files and you need to pass into a find command may confuse if there are files that have names that looks like the options that passing in will search recursively through the current if you wish to use slashes in your it can be a pain to quote them correctly with you can instead choose a different character to delimit your regular will use the first character after the command as a your pattern is also lacking a in regular to indicate one instance of any character you use and to indicate or more of the preceding you use so indicates or more of any is different from glob in which alone means or more of any you really do want to be including your standard error stream in your standard so it will pass through the then you can awk you just want to ignore you can redirect that to which is a special file that just discards anything that goes into awk i think the command below will help you with your immediate and the other suggestions listed above may help you if i did not undersand what you were looking awk print

 have previously worked in the game and did something along these to my no one ever bothered cracking the score submitting way it was done was a random number as a salt the score using math based on the salt a checksum to make sure there was no tempering on the score the score and any required data to the score submitting the validate that the score has not been tempered using the the score is then insert it into the reject you you might log ip adresses of the submitters of scores violating the checksums a policy of three bad and add a script to ban them from accessing the server for but this will probably not be required unless someone wants to crack your code that the hashing checksuming was made using a custom did not need something very it was made using a computation on the salt and the some simple math operations like multiplications and a simple algorithm maths for the say your user has a score of generate a random number as a salt of pad with should use something a bit more complex but it is just an our the crypted score would be for the lets say you want to have a value of as a add all the numbers of your crypted score you calculate the value of your checksum for this of crypted score numbers we have the following salt crypted score checksum make a request to the sending as a score you can divide by giving and validate the checksum using the same function as the checksum then numbers have been could probably end up with something much more but it should do the

 have read in an image using so it is probably coming in as the help for imread says the result will be integer of some order for a tiff what class was i when it was then filtered the it appears that imfilter will return an integer image for an integer input you add using from the online help for it internally converts the image to a adds the gaussian then converts back to integer so your blurred image should still be probably uint8 help for fspecial says it will return a double precision output for called deconvolucy with only two so it is using the default value for argue that this should not fail the author of deconvolucy appears not to have supplied a default value that was consistent in type with the knowing enough about the ipt or i might first suggest this using two different one of these calls did not fix the it suggests that deconvolucy expects a double input for the the online help for deconvolucy was not specific it says only that i may be an n dimensional array or a cell further on in the it calls the result a numeric so i believe that the image for deconvolucy is expected to be a floating point my this is a flaw in the would then probably try scaling your image to as a it is just a guess so something assumes your image was uint8 in class

 have seen two solutions to this kind of the first is to try to use characteristics to define subordinate products to the the challenge here is that in addition to your thoughts for in most cases the product will evolve with new manufacturers that bring new aspects to the for one manufacturer may make a cheaper but have a different application method for the logo or stitching that may be significant enough to think that carrying a non significant product number for each product and then attaching the characteristics as attributes works out the it is easily searched and if a group of products are strongly a productgroup that the individual products attach to works advantages here are that you can easily query for specific attributes are in that more can be added old ones if you started with but then added another to the color you can change them to and can control price and inventory are at the detail product level more tables may be required to account for all assumes that your characteristics are universally if they are your characteristic subtable approach can work by creating a join table between characteristics and the product detail tables and populate as this will require more business logic ensure each product category gets characteristics this latter case i would use products in the base product table qty and cost of that i would clone the characteristics from and then adjust as each new product is as you move when a new variation having a this function that allows you to just adjust the from the base product would be as far as managing the inventory and this is going to happen at the ui being able to generate queries for related products and manage all the pricing for related products will go a long way to making this

 have several systems of this the disturbing part of all this is the support status of there is a risk that you be able to get help from microsoft with a showstopper issue with a future server and have the ability to fix it yourself due to incompatibilities between the vb6 and the patched server this is a risk your management might be interested in but if you have any support agreements perhaps they are comfortable with actually looking at rewriting and redesigning a few of the more critical tried incremental and it can but makes for an us interesting operations and maintenance strongly recommend instrumenting everything and new with plenty of configurable if you to help with fault sounds like a reasonable interface between legacy and unless you have very simple interactions between i really see why you would like to move back to a more basic ipc com has its but it also provides a lot of useful abstractions for data typing and versioning that have to reinvent and

 having two major issues on my series of links is cutting off the left edges of the menu items and also seemingly transposing characters from other items in the having a massive anything between 2em and are identical in but the moment it steps above that the size jumps realise that i probably need to try offsetleft for the first and to define the ratios for the second i just seem to do problems stem from not being able to comprehend the instructions on the site when compared with the downloadable the downloadable example seems to use the preferred replaceelement method and inlude a the instructions seen on how to make this work rely on the more method of setup and calling via the config i seem to be able to get it working using the traditional method only had success at displaying anything when using the example tried using and have been unable to retrieve the ratios which i feel would fix have no idea where to insert the statement or how to use it within the new replaceelement all complicated by being utilised within joomla tho not used the available plugin as it work for me and was based on a previous version of the statement at the bottom of my body replacement please see documentation for more sifr this is the preferred echo echo echo really tearing my hair out so any help would be hugely sifr confusion sifr3 vs sifr2	
 header handling in php is actually not very flexible and go as far as saying that especially the use two namespaces within the header will make it impossible to inject the header simply by using a of some think the best way to handle this one is to shape the xml request yourself by overriding in a custom class that extends extends public function new do your processing using dom insert security header and so return see for further information and some	
 headers have to be this as bad as it could since modern compilers provide some sort of option for not processing them repeatedly with something like or an every header has to be processed once for each translation and that can add up usual practice is for header files to only those header files they and to use forward declarations as much as that you get the you want to everything and its you can provide your own header file that you have to explicitly write everything out in every header and source that option is something you can but if everything in std came as one monolithic you have an

 heard about all the hackers who got caught and then received a killer job then probably heard about it workers who sabotaged their systems after being some people also argue that hacking is much easier than securing a question you hire a and hacking make a better reason i ask this is that i know a few people who first became interested in programming because of and they seem to be fairly confident of their programming as a it feels like people respect them as the but i always felt at least as capable even though i know as much about hacking as they hacking make you a better

 here is something that has caused some friction at my current job and i really expect it organized in house software development is a new concept here and i have drawn up a first draft of some coding have proposed that code should never be checked into the the reason i have stated this is that the repository maintains a full history of the if you are removing the functional code then remove it the repository keeps your changes so it is easy to see what was has caused some friction in that another developer believes that taking this route is too this developer would like to be able to comment out some code that he is working on but is this code then would never have been checked in before and then not saved we are going to be using tfs so i suggested that shelving the changes would be the most correct it was not accepted however because he would like to be able to checkin partial changes that may or may not be want to eventually get to a point where we are taking full advantage of continuous integration and automatically deploying to a development web currently there is no development version of web servers or database servers but that will all be changed what are your do you believe that code is useful to have in the very interested to hear from others on this clarity we use private if we did then say do what you want with your private branch but ever merge commented out code with the trunk or any shared is no valid reason we use private or per user not a concept i disagree we just set it up that way perhaps that is the eventual middle for now we use tfs in of

 hinges here on the agreed upon definition of hack hack coder hacker cracker script kiddie jedi cyberpunk ninja code monkey reverse engineer criminal mischevious person felon convicted felon suspected felon mastermind chaotic good characters chaotic evil doers dictators emperor insurgent terrorist agents neo copyright violators copy writers spammers marketers telemarketers spyware creators computer virus for programmers necessarily have done hacking in the rebelled against the but were though not technically law great programmers certainly associate themselves as being a hacker in the romantic cyberpunk sense of the however being a hacker does not imply a lack of morals or hackers may find that their conscience does not prohibit them from executing technological deeds that the general societal concensus may deem as questionable at best or worse reprehensible or worst literally flat out free will does of engineers and crackers are usually better than your average hacker at i would never hire anyone who at least know how to do some reverse it is necessarily a part of being a good from my then i consider myself a fairly veteran and have seen an abnormally high number of instances that completely justify reverse engineering for corporate gain the avoidance of corporate have never had a problem not doing things that i know i if i wanted free time is a good instant reward for moderate amounts of who wants to go out of way to break come i have never identified what makes a criminal organization except for the profit depends on what you consider what you what you all hackers are in the vast majority are intent on remaining a hardened criminal is probably not going to be someone you want to but it depends on your first of you may not even have the choice to hire a convicted felon depending on your industry or for your are you in again if you are dealing specifically with security and and it is virtually a requirement that you truly are smart as a and that you have the salt to outsmart foxes should you be given a chance to accept such a masterminds would never get if they ever got they would have lost their prior status as a masterminds could be criminals but not and probably need to be hired by you for your measly some good masterminds probably are out i know do want those you want the you want you want you want vast gobs and gobs of you want people who can fix any problem and are undeterred by you want people who know that anything truly is just intelligent systems of logic consider all so never going to find smart people to work for you who have not even considered doing something wrong in their entire you are looking for law abiding citizens to work for it is best to look for people who at least portray outwardly some behavior that seems to imply an internal value system that generally jives with what you think of as you never know what is going on in just because someone has never been caught does not mean that everything that they do in their personal life is perfectly legal or ethical or but there are probably want to hire people who are doing very bad things even on their own what you consider to be very bad things may a called may not be illegal in your but could still be for for for for for for the continuum for god for the for for for for for for dungeons and dragons you want to hire people who fit your whether you be government or some sort of a crime consider myself sort of hat i have done black hat kinds of things never gotten and plan on engaging in those kinds of activities on a regular anything in your personal or professional life that people could blackmail you for or put you behind bars for is generally dumb all the way whether you are a criminal or a jedi or just looking to hire people or collecting information that could be used to blackmail people is the worst and certainly far worse than breaking into any have worked in carrier scale job banking and have had access to extremely ridiculous amounts of extremely sensitive data and have written apps against that i get to do that by being a dodo brain in the first you should have access to lots of data is kind of like asking whether or not you should have the one ring from the the lord of the only those who you know have no interest in using it should have high levels of have felt comfortable having been given official professional access to lots and lots of data on the premise that i could spider most of it myself anyways off the internet for were i ever in a real mostly why what me who the type of person who use the one even if i had why usually i have had to share the burden of being on the side of good and have had to hope that the baddies never got in and have had to try my hardest to make sure how things have tended to really a baddie anyway i would like to think of you as my and not my i want to see you to go to jail for anything you did with some ones and and with some if you ever directly or indirectly knowingly put lives or liberties in whether in the name of the empire or in the name of the shame on do the fact there are lots of systems on which the safety of lives directly no bad people should be running those no people who could ever turn bad should be running those think about should anyone have the keys to the systems know who to build a truly secure trust no one not even

 hit a stack pretty much out of luck for debugging the problem blowing your stack space leaves your program in a so you rely on of the information in it at that point any stack trace you try to get may be corrupted and can easily point you in the wrong once the stackoverflowexception too according to you catch a stackoverflowexception from so the other suggestions to surround your code with a for that probably this makes perfect given the side effects of a stack overflow surprised ever allowed you to catch only real option is to engage in the tedium of analyzing the looking for anything that could potentially cause a stack and putting in some sort of markers so you can get an idea where they occur they obviously any recursive methods are the first place to so give them a depth counter and your own if they get to some value that you that way you can actually get a valid stack	
 hlgem gave some good advice it exactly what i done quite a bit of testing over the past few and i figured at least share the results here given that it looks like no more information will be set up a table that was effectively a narrower subset of one of our primary and populated it with production data so that it was as deep as our production version of the then duplicated that and on the first one wrote a trigger that attempted to detect every individual column and then predicated each column update on whether the data in that column had actually changed or the second i wrote a trigger that used extensive conditional case logic to do all the updates to all the columns in a single then ran 4 update to a single update to 10000 update to a single update to 10000 repeated this test for both indexed and versions of the and then repeated the whole thing on sql 2000 and sql 2008 results i got were fairly second method single update statement with hairy case logic in the set was uniformly than the individual change detection a greater or lesser extent depending on the with the single exception of a change affecting many rows where the column was running on sql in our particular case we do many deep updates like so for my purposes the approach is definitely the way to be interested in hearing other results of similar types of to see whether my conclusions are as universal as i suspect they are or whether they are specific to our particular get you here is the test script i used obviously need to come up with other data to populate it table int not null primary i1 int i2 int i3 int v1 v2 v3 d1 datetime d2 datetime d3 datetime table int not null primary i1 int i2 int i3 int v1 v2 v3 d1 datetime d2 datetime d3 datetime optional indexing test with it on and index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on into test1 add data population into test2 d3 from trigger on test1 for select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where update test1 set i1 case when then else from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where update test1 set i2 case when then else from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where update test1 set i3 from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where update test1 set v1 from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where test1 set v2 inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on update test1 set v3 from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where update test1 set d1 from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where update test1 set d2 from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where test1 set d3 inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on trigger on test2 for update test2 i1 when then case when then else else i2 when then case when then else else i3 when then else v1 when then else v2 v3 when then else d1 when then else d2 when then else d3 from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on the below code can be used to confirm that the triggers operated identically over both tables after a top 10 test1 inner join test2 on or or or test 1 one one test1 set i3 64 where test2 set i3 64 where test1 set i3 64 where test2 set i3 64 where test 2 one 10000 test1 set v3 where between 10000 and test2 set v3 where between 10000 and test 3 all 1 test1 set i1 i2 i3 v1 v2 v3 am d1 d2 d3 test2 set i1 i2 i3 v1 v2 v3 am d1 d2 d3 test 4 all 10000 test1 set i1 i2 i3 v1 v2 v3 am d1 d2 d3 between 30000 and test2 set i1 i2 i3 v1 v2 v3 am d1 d2 d3 between 30000 and table table	
 honestly not a fan of coding bootcamps or short duration courses in terms of money an issue i would say go for it but since you are paying your own way and brought up the money aspect going to assume that at least some consideration must be taken before dropping find that i can honestly absorb much more material and at greater depth by simply reading a book and attempting exercises or small projects certainly there are some tips tricks that can be imparted to you through actual instruction that you might not glean right away from but those things be the bulk of the knowledge you have to programs remind me of short duration certification expensive and of little you have to be you are there for 4 you are going to learn how to setup the development shown some canned examples that you follow along with illustrating the basics of the and other iphone that really worth it to to a serious professional developer would simply sit down with a few of the books and start banging out some chapters on their time in my save yourself some money and spend bucks on and take a few days off	
 hope that in this i can get opinions on best practices for the interface between jsf pages and backing thing that i never can settle on is the structure of my backing i have never found a good article on the properties belong on which backing when is it appropriate to add more properties to a given bean as opposed to creating a new bean and adding the properties onto for simple does it make sense to just have a single backing bean for the whole considering the complexity involved with injecting one bean into should the backing bean contain any actual business or should it strictly contain free to answer these questions and any others that may come for reducing coupling between the jsf page and the backing i never allow the jsf page to access any backing bean for i never allow something such always require something a backing bean value string return i loop over a i use a wrapper class to avoid drilling down into an object in a data for this approach feels to it avoids any coupling between the view and the please correct me if backing bean structure

 hoping someone can provide some advise for an easier way to deal with this i am working on creating a flattened view of a highly normalized set of the goal of flattening is to provide a view which normal people can use to develop reports the source data contains a couple of tables as table variables int not null not not primary key unique table int not null references runs on delete int not null references on delete not primary key in the record values table corresponds to one of the variables in the original input say an address or an account for an input record that has 12 variables in there will be twelve rows in the record values inputs to the original process include records of varying widths and variable these are split out into tuples in the i am writing a procedure to reassemble the variables back into a record that looks like is actually an underlying account current approach is to dynamically build the table by finding the unique variables for the given set of runs not important and then building a sql string that will create the challenge is how to efficiently load this resulting work table from the original since the names and number of the variables varies with the only way i can think of to approach this is through something a cursor for the list of each variable in the create a cursor to find all the record values for that for each record update the appropriate in the work is going to run as the parent tables have of millions of anyone have an idea about how to generate an approach that i can use to do one update per destination anyone jump on the design of the original tables there were business reasons to do it this i like but there were good reasons for doing for any thoughts you can flattening name value pairs into a

 how i approached this problem while maintaining a 10 year old legacy perl to give a slight bit of this was some of the worst of the i was initially depressed when i started working at the company because the code was so poorly thought out and laid out it was my first programming by the end of that gig i had a pretty good system of every new feature was added as a new module or nothing was hacked in on top of the existing this let me write unit tests for the new providing the confidence in so to integrate with the old stuff was just a matter of a line or any bugfix was implemented the same spend some time figuring out what was happening with the old stuff searching for the and write it out as a new method and wrap it in and then typically could however only works if got the and the to get it if you keep track of the time that you spend on any given especially where multiple bugs in the same or or at some point in easy to point at a given collection of code and say that this is so has cost n amount of time to was successful enough with this approach that i gained the honorary title also a fantastic skill to because more often than not the new job already has some code written

 i bind gridview to then the first time page will be gridview will display columns retrieved from data but if on postback i set to null or to an empty protected void eventargs if then gridview display any rows at but why is gridview has enableviewstate set to then it should be able to display rows it retrieved from data source when page was first realize one could argue that framework notices that datasourceid has changed and assumes gridview need data from previous data but assume framework would realize that empty string or null reference point to any of data source and thus remove any data gridview retrieved from previous data what is going on is once you have set the datasourceid to null or an empty string the control takes this as an indication from the consumer of the control that they do not wish to bind any data at all viewstate the control checks the datasourceid prior to binding and if it is an empty string then it does not databind in its ensuredatabound if you set datasourceid to null inside but gridview only checks datasourceid moments before binding which happens much after then until datasourceid is viewstate containing data from previous data source should still be available inside and still an event handler subscribed to an event that caused a datasourceid to causes gridview to

 i connect to the sql server 2008 remotely it only works after that the server the service cannot be stopped or restarted and when trying to connect again it gives a server has connections the default port is set to 1433 and i cleared the 0 from the dynamic i enabled the ip and the public ip and set the 1433 ip to named pipes and the other protocol memory or are am connecting from the remote machine using the user and a strong the server is set to accept both authentication for the first time from the remote machine works queries work and data can be retrieved from the after disconnecting and trying to connect again it gives a timeout this error is generated because the sql server is hanged this point it is impossible to stop or restart the sql server service from the service the only solution is to restart the connecting to the server locally from sql management studio still think it has something to do with going into an infinite loop or it drop the connection on the 1433 port after disconnecting from the remote machine and it still waits for input from server 2008 remote connection only works	
 i consider it visual i think the this variable is a crutch to bad naming within my type i should be able to manage the naming of the properties and is absolutely no good reason to name your backing field the parameter to the constructor as and the property to be public class private string public public string myfield return set i always add a prefix of to all my private backing public class private string public public string myfield return set now with automatic properties in public class private string myfield public myfield than the above maybe the only other time you type is because you want to see the intellisense for your current if you need to do this then i submit that your type is too big and probably not following the responsibility and lets say you why keep the around after you actually make the refactor it

 i did some with the guidance that avisser gave i was able to figure out what i had to for future reference for anyone who might have this question one here is what i figured create a with the variables you will be i wanted to use variables for the in my cobol compiler that had the default values of and so i wrote something proc use those newly defined symbolic parameters in your actual jcl the character shows that whatever follows it is a symbolic i used the aforementioned for my cobol compile exec end your with a statement after your actual after i listed all of my variables and i listed all the steps for compilation where the compiler can be as can be seen right before the pend the place your pend dd add any additional jcl steps code to your source file and can have more than one proc statement in a single jcl i had one for cobol one for the linkage editor and one for the program i also have cobol code in the same file that my proc statements are took place on an ibm mainframe running it can be seen that my variable is set to the default of it is possible to have a variable be null by default by simply leaving the field blank may have noticed that after the cparm there is a this is because i have more variables after please remember that the last symbolic parameter you create for any given proc should have nothing following it no you of place a comment line another proc or actual code but the last symbolic parameter should have nothing following it on the same

 i do not use boost being the standard problem with these issues is more or less what you for any single serialization you requesting several a lot of chuncks of memory from the and then you free when you actually know more or less how much memory need to begin the only solution i know of is to implement something similar to the apache you allocate a block of memory and have your allocator you give to stl or to work inside this then you have classes like which allocate memory inside the two this is not very but you can put a nice envelope around it system architect where i work did something like you have to take care of the case where you need to alocate another

 i finally found a way to check if results were selected or not the huge help of of we set up an hidden field which will record if a result was selected by it is set to afterupdateelement is only used after a so we use this aferupdateelement to turn our hidden field to the user changes the search field for a brand new value not no afterupdateelement is and our hidden value is still set to solution to that problem is to listen to a key if a key is then the hidden field turns back to this works for all even the enter key actually used to make a so this is an exception we should remove from our keypress finally have a look to our extra function keycode else if keycode if can then use the hidden field to know if the text value should be edited or with this if the user types a value matching an existing without selecting it will be considered as a new and will lead to a duplicate entry if you add this value to your this was ok for as i was working with and two different people may have the same	
 i first played with visual basic version 1 or the first thing i did was try to recreate properties in probably before templates were available to me at the but now it would be something class class towner tvalue return operator return tvalue tvalue return struct struct void const int void int that the parameter is ignored in the implementations of only there to effectively act as part of the name of the via overload the user of would be able to refer to the public members and in many situations as if they were raw but they merely provide an alternative syntax for calling the corresponding member not because there are some situations where have to call on a property to get the whenever the compiler is unable to infer the required type also you might get a warning from the passing of to members in the but you could silence that in this	
 i first saw i thought it was basically a representation of then i the important thing that a particularly representation of but that it is one that everyone agrees just like and once hard to displace due to network the new alternative would have to be much better 10 times to displace of ascii has been replaced by for to xml has a x43 but is declining while json will json replace xml as a data which which are another representation of but which has not gained mainstream there are many other such as yaml and protocol buffers binary can see json dominating the space of communicating with ajax and this possibly could into other systems being based on is better than json as a interested in xml as a has an established ecosystem that json especially ways of defining formats and transforming them xml also has many other esp for web services but their weight and complexity can arguably count against and make people want a fresh start to beginning as a fresh start over like json is json replace xml as a data

 i had the need for a matrix type in a trivial answer to this need would be to use but the additional issue i have is that i would like a matrix to store arbitrary values with mixed similarly to a does not perform an example you can the must be homogeneous in if a string value is present in my every value gets implicitly stored as a this is also confirmed by accessing the single the python list type can instead accept mixed you can have a list containing an integer and a both conserving their what i would need is something similar to a but operating in a i had to implement my own i had two choices for the internal list containing and both solutions have of lists require careful synchronization of the various swapping two rows is swapping two columns is less removing a row is easy as a tuple as a are slightly but you have to define the limits of your key you cannot insert element if your matrix is and they are more complex to use to or swap columns or the concrete reason on why i need this functionality is because i am reading csv once i collect the values from a csv file that can be i would like to perform insertion and other operations for this reason i need a curiosities you know if a python data type providing this service already exists in a library out is this data type not provided in the standard too restricted interest would you have solved this or another smarter in

 i have 1 or 2 tables of history to keep i would do it exactly as tuinstoel has but if you had dozens of tables to do this on i would move more toward a solution described by the reason is do you answer questions changed since yesterday when everything was user smithg made any questions require a one query per whether a separate table or a partition inside the no some huge list of if you have a central table that looks like then a piece of have only after have only before have both but only for the columns which can include a column for if you can exclude column values for inserts and just record the pk and i since the correct values are still in the this is oracle you could partition on so in essence you actually do have one hist per real can easily answer the above which i believe quite the most often asked and it handles every question you can answer with partitions or

 i have an abstract data type called regionmodel with a series of values each mapped to an possible to remove a number of regions by question is the best way to handle a call when the index is valid 0 and the number of regions in the model the numberofregionstoremove is regionstoremove the number of regions in the it best to throw an exception like illegalargumentexception or just to remove as many regions as i can the regions from index to the end of the if i throw an exception the recommended way to unit test that the call threw the exception and left the model untouched using java and junit here but i guess this a java specific practice for incorrect parameters on a remove	
 i have big enough server farm and is there a max number of objects i can put into memcached before i start seeing performance your cache should be full at all memcached uses a hashing algorithm to lookup so as far as i there be a performance penalty for storing more i cache smaller but more objects in or bigger but less number of would imagine that bigger but fewer objects would be preferable to reduce the amount of time for both database and cache but you should take this on a case by case unless you know that the performance difference would be recommend starting with easiest first and working from there if that	
 i have exactly one per test but i think more often i have several seen the case that eludes where a very large piece of code has a single unit test suite with just a few test and they are all labeled and each test case has hundreds of and even each condition usually depends upon the of previous whenever the build invariably in such a unit it takes quite some time to determine where the problem the other extreme is what your question a separate test case for each possible depending on what this might make but often i have several per test if you wrote you might have some cases that look void void void void try int number numberformatexception for string numstr but instead got the number expected simple rules that i can think of off hand for how many to put in a test have more than one that depends on the of previous together that test the same or facet need for the overhead of multiple unit test cases when not of the above rules should be overridden by practicality and common you probably want a thousand unit test cases with a single assert in each even several and you want a single test case with hundreds of	
 i have found python to be more just however there are several commited java developers out there that will appreciate the java support in supporting java was a good choice by google since it will allow the gae platform to potentially host many other obviously a little early to expect all jvm based languages to run on but the future looks for now we can look at what is and working by taking a look at gae java group back to i think small web applications will work great with the webapp other applications will benefit more from django have a look at the under the frameworks section for a few good reads on in any you will undoubtedly have restrictions in any of your choices since most web frameworks are designed with relational databases in mind which is the gae platform has to be sandboxed for security reasons which also restrict you to some hope this	
 i have found strange since i started working on gwt is how few open source projects there are in this i was surprised to discover this mainly because gwt itself is open but after puzzling over my suspicion is that it is mainly used for internal projects by large corporations who already use java and are using gwt for their rias instead of flex or my understanding is that large corporations that use java would tend to have lower contributions to open source because their focus is mainly on internal or commercial this sound like an accurate interpretation or does anyone have a different explanation for this are there so few open source gwt

 i like php but first and it is a templating not a general purpose programming language an fight embrace looked at a few different mvc frameworks like cakephp and zend and i have a hard time getting past the typically they are these 17 files you can make a is such a thing as complexity for sake of it and solving a problem before you have a problem and yet to be convinced that these heavyweight frameworks really adds more of a fan of the this is really your but i think that it leads to the cleanest end feel similarly about a lot of people on so are big fans of smarty but never made sense to me why add a templating language to templating i end up writing this kind of php script most of the set up db connections and so page site menu and so user submitted page validation rules if do db redirect user ie else output error display judicious use of helper functions pagination the above is incredibly easy to read and i also much prefer it to this hopefully you sanitize this but so many find this and even i have a hierarchy of php files that mirrors the site structure a menu point of where each page is a php if they have common behaviour they both require it which is typically used as a hack for poor seems a lot of programmers will throw a framework into the mix before there is really ever any i think this is a fairly lazy practice and one with a big every decision made today is one that becomes harder to change later so put off making decisions like this as long as introducing something later is easier than introducing something finding out it really do what you want and then changing it

 i see no benefit on selecting jca over other i see it as a drawback since you need java ee been skeptic about these java ee standards for some time i see a compelling reason to use a full featured java ee server since there are better open source implementations for feature been bitten several times by implementation incompatibilities when moving idea for jca is surfacing here right now and i am pushing to try or i am all for open source implementations that you can use and there is a lot going check list of maybe is smaller than whats already developed with but every bit is open sourced and all on one i believe the documentation is simpler and more the urge for integration calls for a powerful spi with plenty of open real live developed in the same and that can be found on the same am hating the but i like full featured application for i would go for tomcat and terracota over other just as i would go with camel before until the need for jca gets i like the idea of the java committee to tell how i should develop my own applications because i trust i believe it is in my best interest when the piece of software can work just as easily on java as in a java ee environments or in a pure servlet

 i think i reproduced roughly what your describing and i deleted my original answer cause it was way i found is that when you want a content page to reference a user control being used in a master page and the control is accesible and what you will get an error indicating that you need to reference a specific and then you get errors indicating that no method exists of type such and adding the register page directive on the child page to the user control resolved this i reproduced this even with the control defined in the or on the in both cases i still had to explicitly add a register on the content make sense to me but it allowed my code to compile and give it a shot let me you do this you can reference the control assumes that you have a public property called messagebox on the master also found that this works much better if you register the control on both the master and the content page and not use the you want your child page to reference the user control your other option is expose methods on the master page like which would delegate to the user

 i try to replicate the without being able to replicate the error it is basically impossible in a program to guess the if break out the code in a separate standalone there are several reasons for if the original project is big it quite difficult to debug second it eliminates or highlights any assumptions about the normally always have another copy of vs open which i use for the debugging parts in mini projects and to test routines which i later add to the main having reproduced the error in the separate module the battle is almost it is not easy to break out a piece of code so in those cases i use different methods depending on how complex the issue in most cases assumptions about data seem to come and bite me so i try to add lots of asserts in the code in order make sure my assumptions are i also disabling code by using until the error eliminating dependencies to other modules sort of slowly circling in the bug like a vulture think i have really a conscious way of doing it varies quite a lot but the general principle is to eliminate the noise around the issue until it is quite obvious what it hope i sound too confusing	
 i trying to drive a screw with possibly reading this you have a situation where actions within a controller have different access so you want to remove the duplication by creating a single check looking to do something like the parameter in parens thing is not and i still see a fair bit of duplication with an area of functionality as as controller if you do probably because looking at something the wrong that rails is proud to describe itself as would it be if you were able to know the action name in your filter is pretty could define permissions in a which seem to encapsulate the distinct elements of the if it got complex then the whole thing could move off into a although then probably duplicating functionality already available in a for in return if to that area requires additional something works on my current rails version although the rails book mentions an method that seems to return blank for	
 i understand the probleam you should have the class declared as abstract with the common behavior encapsulated in the problematic method should be declared as abstract as well and you should leave it up to the concrete implementation in a subclass how it manages the desired in the you can test the type of the stream with then convert the object to and then you can use the with no the you have to implement this method another mean something like abstract class baseconnect protected outputstream public abstract void common behavior implemented in this class objectstreamconnect extends baseconnect public objectstreamconnect os new public void if instanceof else throw some exception here or because this should not class datastreamconnect extends baseconnect public datastreamconnect os new public void implement writing of the object in another way you should also rename the baseconnect to but this depends on your code	
 i understand the question and you understand why bad things happen when you access memory out of but wondering why your particular compiler warn are allowed to warn and many do at the highest warning however the standard is written to allow people to run compilers for all sorts of and compilers with all sorts of features so the standard requires the least it can while guaranteeing people can do useful are a few times the standard requires that a certain coding style will generate a there are several other times where the standard does not require a even when a diagnostic is required not aware of any place where the standard says what the exact wording should not completely out in the cold if your compiler warn lint there are a number of tools to detect such problems run for arrays on the one of the more famous being electric fence but even electric fence guarantee it will catch all overrun

 i was doing some profiling of different ways to hit my sqlserver i did vanilla a and a noncompiled linq performance went in that same as but i noticed something curious when profiling the latter sql generated by the compiledquery was much better than what was generated by the plain old sqlexpress table is called columna is primary key columnb is a random getbypk int as select as as x as outer join top as from as where as on 1 for generated really when i do the plain linq as as as as select top as as as 1 as from as left outer join as as from as as on where as is just i guess the question is it possible to give regular linq to entities the same amount of sql suckiness as a plain linq sql

 i was hooking into but this took too long as it fire until firefox has loaded the dom tree for the page and any of its was similarly slow because it requires the page to fully load as well as all its after going through as well as setting up xpcom for and a few i ultimately settled on as that seems to fire even when the html page has no or has an equivalent to the previous remember why i settled on but i believe it was because it was the best fit for my needs which the quickest way to get the navigated url without waiting for anything to load while simultaneously firing on every conceivable way a new page is new page and all only catch is that you will need to add code to manually look up the url in your overlay startup as unless you before ff starts loading the first page on new you will have added your event listener too late to reliably catch that initial page is because a isolated instance of your is loaded every time firefox opens a new

 inside my organization we are trying to come up some conventions for a pilot soa at first glance we thought it would be best to force users of the service to use the business service direct access to any data endpoints but are there specific scenarios where this is not true or it might be for developers to have access to specific data endpoints outside of a always fear that if we open this it will actually hurt reuse because everyone will just similar business services using the same data as available and would be theory to just write a new business service rather than ask does this other service do that uses my even if the service is almost a direct pass through to the database we would have the ability to apply rules that would save developers time and ultimately the business data access for business services as a separate web service or

 is a and so contains oodles of good and bad advice on me just tell you what i have found from much experience doing performance are tradeoff curves between performance and other things like memory and and you would expect that to get better performance you would have to give something is only true if the program is the tradeoff most as first is away from the tradeoff most of the it is irrelevant and ignorant to talk about giving up one thing to get method i use is not it is i care how fast various routines are or how often they are i want to know precisely which instructions are causing and dominant and primary cause of poor performance in software efforts little is too many layers of abstraction are each of which extracts a performance this is not usually a problem until it is a problem and then a what i do is tackle one issue at a i call these short for each slug that i remove yields a speedup of anywhere from to depending on how bad it every slug that is removed makes the remaining ones take a larger fraction of the remaining so they become easier to in this all the can be quickly disposed that i know what is costing the but the fixes may be more such as partial redesign of the possibly by removing extraneous data structure or using code if it is possible to do that can set off a new round of until the program is many times not only faster than it was to begin but smaller and clearer as recommend getting experience like this for because then when you design software you will know what to and you will make better designs to begin at the same you will find yourself at odds with less experienced colleagues who begin thinking about a design without conjuring up a dozen to try to answer your optimization should be done when diagnosis says you have a some code at the bottom of the call stack appears on enough call stack samples or to be known to be costing significant and if the is in code you can if got a in or look higher up the stack for things to get rid that

 is about set or more relational read a brief primer on and learn to think in not in the practical there are four fundamental which show some projection of a which remove some subset of a which add rows to a which change data in a i mean any including the empty and not necessarily a proper i can write a column name in ddl as the target of an i can write an expression that uses column or 3 from will return the resultset 2 once for each row in the if the column named is of type and the function returns a month number given a from will show me the month number for each where clause is a predicate that restricts rows or or updated to those rows for which the predicate is a where cause can be composed of an arbitrary number of predicates connected by the logical operators and just like the column list in a i can use column and constants in my what result set do you think is returned from from table where 1 a tables are related by in which some datum or key in one is related by an operator to a datum or key in another the relational operator is often but can in fact be any binary operator or even a are as i mentioned by a row in a table may relate to or many rows in another this is referred to as the cardinality of the relations may be there are standard ways of representing each before you look up the standard ways to do think about how represent each what the minimum requirements of each kind see that a relation can in fact also model and ask yourself given all relations are not among pioneered the idea of normal form in relational there are commonly held to be five or six normal but the most important summary of normal form is every entity that your database models should be represented by one row and one row every attribute should depend on the and every row should model an entity or a a primer on normal and understand why you can get data inconsistencies if a your database all try to understand why i like to say you lie to the it will lie to by this i mean bad i mean bad if you model a relation as what can be what can happen if your tables in practical is a select query given a name and stored in the if i often join table to table through the relation maybe i can write a view that selects the columns of interest from that and use the view instead of alway rewriting the write a whatever be simpler and clearer if you write a view for every calculation or you write a view that encapsulates each write a view that encapsulates each almost anything you want to do can be done in a a query into views serves the same ends as functional decomposition serves in procedural it allows you to concentrate on doing one thing makes it more easily and allows you to compose more complex functionality out of simpler an example where i use views to transform a table into forms that more easily allow me to apply successive in order to get to a conflate each table ought to unambiguously model one thing kind of and only one each column should express one and only one attribute of that different kinds of entities belong in different is your your database platform will provide some what it provide you should since metadata is all the rules for modeling data you can for the names of all objects in your database from the sytem table contains all the to find all the columns in one join and on and add a clause restricting the resultset to a particular table sit down at a database and ask can i represent people with hair colors and professions and what tables and relations are implied in modeling then model as ask can i show all blonde doctors who reside in and write the query that does piece it together by writing views that show you all all and all people who reside in find that in asking can i find expose deficiencies in your and find that you want or even need to change the way your model make the see how they make your queries easier or harder to

 is actually a really excellent and the short answer is we used to do it that and there was a whole area of enterprise in the common ood notations evolved from we was that designs like that had some the biggest of them being that the natural structure for a data base necessarily match well to the natural structure for to a great derives from the desire to make it easier to find a code structure that has a couple of desirable should be easy to think out the should be robust under ease to think out design comes originally from which used what we now think of as for simulation it was convenient in simulation to have software entities that correspond to the things it was only later that alan kay et al at xerox saw that as a more general structuring part about robustness under changes had many but one of the most important ones among them was dave you wrote several papers that identified a basic rule for which i call every module should keep a and that secret is a requirements that is likely to turns out that by combining law with the simula idea of a as corresponding to something that can be identified with the real you to get system designs that are more robust under requirements changes than the old way we did and sometime you have to be as with the most objects are thing that have persistent in the command the ideal objects are things you it also turns out that that structure necessarily a good way to represent the underlying data in a relational so we end up with the relational impedance how to represent the transformation from objectland to

 is almost certainly simpler and safer to use a well tested external library you can find google than to code a filter since you said anything about you the format of you there is little more that we can tell know anything about how your ide but importing usual takes one of three forms depending on how the library is made available to you to obtain source for one or more functions with good read the copy the code into the appropriate add the files to the attempt to fix missing preprocessor obtain a plain binary library and headers for you from you os package management read the tell the ide where to find the headers and the attempt to fix obtain a framework that provides the this is a bit more but it also starts with read the then probably proceeds a lot like the library but with more code to be any case you will at some point be some of your source files to make the external functionality visible to your you want to find a candidate library to see what form it is provided then read more about your ide to see where you go from so question that might be relevant to your been a long time since i used but if that is your base programming you should be aware that there are of facility that matlab provided to you that are not in plain vanilla you almost certainly want to use some framework or another to give you some of that support

 is an even smarter and see what this code is doing and how we can improve code is serializing the one byte at a for each byte calling which is checking the free space in the internal vector if we have no room for another memory reallocation will happen the reallocation will not happen frequently typically happen by doubling the existing the new byte is copied and the internal size is increased by has a requirement by the standard which dictates that the internal buffer be also happen to have an and here is the best code you can come up is a test invalidlength you probably want to make this much to avoid resizing compressedbytes is as large as the length we want to p this is valid code and designed by the standard for such p points to a buffer that is at least as large as a copy all bytes in one above cast can be done in one go with the but it be this is more serializing this way even with the union is that on an processor the least significant byte will come while one a machine the most significant byte will come if you want to be you use a math method

 is arguably more art than you have to remember is that like many things in programming and your website will be as slow as the slowest link in the meaning you will have some bottleneck such as the web disk your your etc that will limit the speed of your and growing your web site will involve identifying those issues as you grow and addressing at one point you may need to add more at another you may need another cpu and so at other times adding more memory might be useless because memory your lack of a certain resource can be like lack of memory can be masked by intensive disk as your system swaps constantly but disk the what do you first thing is you need to identify make a reasonable as to what a typical user will do and how much they will do ideally you will be able to model 100 or 1000 or however many users you need with software like jmeter to then get an idea of how your website how much bandwidth is going to be required and so by modelling 2000 users you will hopefully be able to see how linearly you web site may find that supporting 1000 users requires 1 gig of ram but 2000 requires 4 an example of scalability that expoes a problem you will have scaling your web site and the kind of thing to be revealed by performance hardware is so cheap these days that rarely a problem except for the biggest and most popular of sites can buy you 1 or even 2 servers with 16g of ram and cores shared and vps hosting are a different story because typically only want to pay for however much bandwidth and disk space you luckily those kinds of solutions tend to alow you to upgrade pretty easily least to a point where eventually have to go dedicating can make some dirty estimates at the beginning of a project by doing what they call of the run key queries say 100 times and work out hwo much cpu time they hit a mocked up page 100 times and work out how much bandwidth it generates and so these rough estimates combined with guesses about how users will use the site will give you a ballpark within a factor of of what

 is at least as much a question about how method works in i think highlighted an interesting situation the first case the keyword on the the compiler decides to use the method overload with the parameter of type c because type is exactly equivalent to that of the parameter passed no implicit conversion is whereas an implicit conversion to the interface i would be required if the compiler were to choose the method that takes an argument of type i in other it chooses the more method the second case the keyword on the the compiler decides to use the overload of with parameter of type i because although you are overriding the method overload in the class it is effectively defined in the parent class making the method overload in fact the overload and therefore the most direct the first one the compiler this will help you to let me know if i need to clairfy any points if wrong about saying that the compiler does these then please correct though it makes little difference for the sake of the argument whether the compiler or it would

 is definitely measurable overhead when calling a virtual function the call must use the vtable to resolve the address of the function for that type of the extra instructions are the least of your not only do vtables prevent many potential compiler optimizations the type is polymorphic the they can also thrash your course whether these penalties are significant or not depends on your how often those code paths are and your inheritance my opinion having everything as virtual by default is a blanket solution to a problem you could solve in other you could look at how classes are generally the header for a class should make quite clear which functions can be overridden by derived classes and how they are having programmers write this documentation is helpful in ensuring they are marked correctly as would also say that declaring every function as virtual could lead to more bugs than just forgetting to mark something as if all functions are virtual everything can be replaced by base classes private everything becomes fair by accident or intention subclasses could then change the behavior of functions that then cause problems when used in the base

 is to do with how overloaded methods are the compiler first looks at the declared type of the expression in this case and looks for candidate methods are first declared in that if there are any methods which are appropriate where all the arguments can be converted to the parameter then it look at any parent this means that overridden where the initial declaration is in a parent get a if there are any appropriate methods in the derived a slightly simpler public virtual void derived public override void public void static void derived d new prints even though the compiler knows there is a matching method with a parameter of type and the argument is type and the conversion from to is than the conversion from to the fact that only the method is originally in means the compiler ignores is highly surprising i can see why it would be the case if override otherwise introducing a more method in the base class could change the behaviour unexpectedly but clearly here about as overriding this is one of the points where i believe the designers made the wrong

 issue in tdd is for you must have an interface against which to write get you must have a rough idea of what your testable units which is built by a which reads from a socket and emits a given this rough you formalize it into actual class and function you start to write your tests knowing compile but through you may start about your how do you set up a socket for your a pain in the the interface you roughed out above the just a good what if your function took an array of bytes and created a class this is much easier to revisit the change the write the class and now write the you can fill in the class and the function until all your tests done with this bit of all you have to do is hook in a real do you trust the socket you not much to test if you trust the socket now got to provide a source for the data that you can run in a controlled a large

 it appears that your goal is just to be able to handle clicks on the option that can be useful for this sort of task is to create an bitmap but which is the exact same size as your source which uses different colors to represent all the clickable for computer for computer could even generate this bitmap somewhat automatically without too much trouble you have a mode where you can click the top left and then bottom right corners of the image to define a new the mouse is you can check the pixel at the scaled coordinates of the mouse position in the overlay and determine what their click corresponds this can be a lot easier than creating loads of and makes it a lot easier to have clickable regions that

 it for readability i find that all the subscripting hurts my so probably write it more i int val or whatever type int result default result if result else if 2 result guessing the compiler will generate similar code with optimizations cranked but i be shocked if one or the other was slightly very and bet that if one it would be the one using the you might get a very slight improvement by changing walking through the array using an index to walking through it using a very compiler and situation p int val or whatever type int result default result if result else if 2 result aware that these are and generally should not even be worried about for readability and correctness just pointing out some options for when the might be warranted suggestions have to backed up with analysis of the particular far as whether the compiler will repeatedly reload from something like or that depends on the flow of control and whether the object being accessed is a global or has had its address taken and passed to something the object is global or has had its address taken and you call a generally the compiler has to assume that the object could have been modified by the function and will have to reload similar issues happen when pointers are used to pass information to using locals can help mitigate this since a compiler can very easily determine that a local is not modified by a called function unless the address of the local is compilers can also try solve this problem by using some sort of global optimization as what msvc does at link example code probably really hitting this problem even if array is global because you the value from the array after called the either of those functions only write to wonder why markdown is removing blank lines from the

 just hide the key and decrypt it when you need using the key is the complicated crackers might set a breakpoint to the place where you use the decrypted key and dump they might scan your code for patterns which show that you are using a known crypto algorithm algorithms have precalculated etc why you need to make the whole software executable hard to for this you use executable running code in a virtual integrity checks all this is to slow down debugging and modifying your most people here point out you stop just slow them go to a cracker forum and ask there for suggestions about key hiding they are most likely helpful if you ask public key crypto hide the key any but it might make it harder theoretically to make a key if doing a licensing

 keeping track of what were the offsets marking the beginning of your segments and each segment length you want to compute that upon which would involve sort the offset list and calculate the distance between two of you will want to check the header of the http response sent by the server to make sure it supports the usage of the range the best way to specify the range is and the range you request includes both and byte thus consisting of micro chunks is something advise against as you might be blacklisted by a firewall rule to block http in suggest you make chunks smaller than 1mb and make more than 10 on what control you plan to have on your if got control you can consider writing only once every 32k at or writing data comment on the mmf but if the downloaded file is large not going to be a good idea as eat up a lot of ram and eventually even cause the system to which is handling the you could just create several files one per optionally preallocate the disk space filling up the file with as many as the size of the chunk might save you sometime while you write during the but will make starting the download and then finally just write all of the chunks sequentially into the final thing you should beware of is that several servers have a concurrent connections and you get to know it in so you should be prepared to handle http and to change the size of the chunks or to create a queue of the chunks in case you created more chunks than

 key is in understanding how the line b given how your code is this line is the equivalent of b that is the order it will execute the assignment happens before the the first effect of this line is that and both refer to the original object the portion will be inside of the operator we increment the of the original at this point and are both pointing at the with a of and will continue to do created a new object inside the operator method and returned it as the output of the will now be updated to point at the newly created now points to a new while continues to point to the why the writeline output appears pointed the operator is meant to do by generating a new breaking that operator overloading on objects is a tricky and this is an excellent example of why better avoided in most for the assignment does not actually happen before the increment when dealing with operators on but the end result is the same in this the original object reference is the operation is carried out on the and then the copied reference is assigned to the just easier to explain if you pretend that assignment happens really happening is that b in due to how the operator works on copy x new original balance is a now points to the new copy still points to the b b and copy now point at the	
 key is to adopt a practice of only deploying code from the source control not familiar with but it must implement the concepts of the question of what to deploy then falls out of the build and release tagging in the source control tips works best if you split the package spec and body into different files that use a consistent file pattern for each for package and for package if you use an automated build process that can process file patterns then you can build all of the specs and then the this also minimizes object invalidations if you are only deploying a package the time in to configure an automated build process that is driven from a release or build state of your source control if you have even a moderate number of db code objects it will pay to be able to build the code into a reference system and compare it to your qa or production

 kind events do you want to setting up a message pump will allow you to process windows api but since this is a console i think of any windows api messages that would be of tend to think of as being associated with windows messages because controls in windows forms application respond to user input using eventhandler which are called in response to windows api no reason you use delegates in a console and you need a message you can even use the eventhandler altough it will seem out of place because it be resonding to windows api course there are other kinds of that you might be interested the most common kind of event scenario involving a console app is to wait for input from the console also common to block on a waithandle or other synchronization object if there are multiple threads in both of these cases could be considered a type of event you create a hidden window time honored still need a windows message to respond so the question to or to are you trying to

 kloc should be small enough to insert generics with a big obviously make sure your code compiles an runs on java se 5 the relatively easy thing about generics is that adding them makes very little change to semantics overloadings can change because of implicit cases as a bad example off the top of my cases adding generics will highlight conceptual problems with the using one as two maps with disjoint key for is an example in the java library where a single class has two distinct mode or like and are very local and can be added enums are rarer and might take some thinking about how you are actually going to use

 little background designing an application that uses a architecture consisting server which loads potentially developed by other client which loads corresponding modules potentially developed by those other each client module corresponds with a server client side communicates with the server side for general and as well as module specific this i think that means client talks to client modules talk to server is and client side is deployment scenario introduces the potential to upgrade the any the and any module being able to using mismatched versions is therefore concerned about versioning thinking so windows service for the for the server to load and communicate with the server modules will give us the greatest flexibility in terms of version compatability between server and server server and each server module vend wcf services for communication to the client communication between the server and a server or between two server modules use the addin advantage of this is that a module can expose a different interface within the server and outside the client uses to and communicate with the client communications with client modules is via the addin communications from the client and from client modules to the server side are via maximum each module will run in a separate the system has modest performance so marshalling and crossing process boundaries is not expected to be a performance requirement is basically summed up get in the way of the other parts of the system not described questions are around the idea of having two different communication and versioning models to work with which will be an added burden on our seems quite but also a little also unsure of commitment to it in the on the other not thrilled with versioning i have a feeling that it would be possible to implement the system within but being fairly new to both i would have no idea of where to am i on the right track am i doing this the hard are there gotchas i need to be aware of on this architecture using wcf and

 little i am loading a wpf ui from a database which is stored in a table of properties which i load into a class i call basically i set controlpresenter as the datacontext of a contentpresenter and use a templateselector to choose which type of control to the load their properties off the dependencyproperties exposed by the all works extremely the problem running into comes when i try to bind data text property to a name in other presenters have normal properties that implement to these the datacontext is the associated controlpresenter so i bind directly to the other presenters and i set up two bindings on the same dependency property bind the control and the desired presenter property to the same could convert all of the other presenters to use dps time consuming and prone to cause problems with could use two dps for each property i want to pass through and try to tie them together through changed of these seem problematic and prone to breaking so hoping someone else has come up with a better i came up with a solution that works fairly well thanks to everyone that looked at this and if you come up with a better method than i did please let me can i implement a

 looking for tips on the best way to reconfigure the log4net logging level dynamically in my i generally use a simple configuration where the root logger defines the default logging etc there may be several each with filters to define the logging levels they first thing like to be able to do would be to allow administrators to connect to an admin page that enables them to view the current level for the root logger and dynamically change i want to use and write to the configuration file on disk because i want these changes to persist when the application is like to go and on an admin page be able to display a treeview with all current loggers that exist in the and their current logging and allow the administrator to be able to change the logging level selectively at any level of the idea is to to create a generic admin page that i can put into all my apps that allows administrators to selectively enable logging dynamically for troubleshooting find the log4net apis a bit can anyone point to samples or show the best way to achieve answers are equally good so accepted the first to i can get all current loggers as log in logger parent level effectivelevel null is the effective level same as level if the latter is not otherwise inherited from the least one of the loggers returned above will have the root logger as which enables me to get a reference to the root the above it should be possible to reconstruct the logger implemented an server control that displays the logger hierarchy in a treeview with and allows the user to dynamically change the logging level at any node in the works great and be putting it on admin page in all my web and web service reconfigure	
 looking over various php libraries noticed that a lot of people choose to prefix some class methods with a single such function function realize that ultimately this comes down to personal but i was wondering if anyone had some insight into where this habit comes thought is that probably being carried over from php before class methods could be marked as protected or as a way of implying not call this method from outside the it also occurred to me that maybe it originates somewhere not familiar with or that there may be good reasoning behind it that i would benefit from insights opinions would be the deal with a leading underscore in php class

 looks like trying to port from ruby to if it might be easier to use a native memcache client implementation such i generally agree with markusq that translating from a language to a language is probably going to be less productive overall than just rewriting in an idiomatic fashion for the target a straight translation from ruby to is going to give you some very ugly at yield ruby keyword allows you to invoke a block of code that was passed as an implicitly declared argument to the for you can think of the method definition as actually looking more ttl when you call as stuff in the braces gets assigned to the variable block in the expanded definition yield then invokes the code in this is a gross but should help you get the general to your the simplification i just did necessarily going to get you because as soon as you find a way to translate that another piece of code will break your for say a given method needs to inspect the if no arguments load defaults from config file and ignore of course since lambdas are objects in you may encounter code like the lambda a b c foo is now defined as a function that sums its three then god help you if you encounter code that defines methods on the or fo a takes advantages of malleable def puts prints def puts prints prints still prints each instance of each class in ruby can have its own class not really sure how you would port even simple examples to without fancy ruby has a lot of these features that will break a simple translation so i would recommend learning the thing trying to and then redoing it from

 looks to me that you are just starting with because even though the browsers do not adhere to the css specification there is a lot of safe ground that you can use with this safe ground is nowadays much larger than it used to be about ten years when coding for web was really a royal and new browser releases adhere to the specification more and which is exactly why the standard it is a kind of theoretical ideal that the browsers will probably never fully but even percent of it are quite useful in the real also wish ie would have better implementation of but once you learn the few things that behave you can code most of the usual layouts without major most common layouts have also been discussed to death on various css forums on the web and there is always some good solution readily available so that you do not have to make it up css standard is imho not the problem least not in the sense of your the problem is the reality of the browser market and the software market in as for the it should mostly go away after you gain some the limits will always be but there is a plenty of safe

 maintain a number of load balanced web servers running windows server today when i want to make a change to those i use a tedious process of opening a remote desktop connection to each of those servers then running a command from the command prompt on each this takes a lot of i would like to do is run a command or write a script on one central server which accesses each of these other windows servers and runs the same command on each of in this scenario i would want to run the command on 5 to 10 but probably not more than commands being run on the remote servers could be any of the a we already have a file on each server for control check out or other command that could be run from the windows command i have domain administrator privileges as well as specific login and password info for each of these know how to do this in with so please do answers that say switch to in advance for the a command on multiple windows

 makes sense to use a pointer to a pointer whenever the pointer actually points towards a pointer chain is hence etc are reason for creating such code is because you want the to be able to properly check the types you are using mystery dont have to use such types you can always simply use a simple and typecast whenever you need to actually dereference the pointer and access the data that the pointer is directing but that is usually bad practice and prone to errors certainly there are cases where using void is actually good and making code much more think of it more like your last its mostly for helping the compiler to make sure things are used the way they are supposed to be

 making a distinction between member and free functions when i was thinking about the but i now see that this was a it now seems to me that structs should only rarely have member it is pretty clear that everything in a struct should be there is generally no point in having struct member functions because any function can change the data in the a member function on a struct would be a convenience rather than a only exceptions would be things required to be member functions for some other purpose constructors for initialising comparisons for use with a things used by class and struct should be seen as opposites a class exposes functions and hides whereas a struct exposes data and allows you to hide back to the byte swapping int void int void i swap void s s makes sense when the data and some functions do not always strongly belong byte swapping would only be of interest to the network system but higher level functions can still use the struct without even knowing about low level stuff like byte benefit in this case is that the related byte swapping operations are all kept together in the same

 may be others with different but in mine checking in code is a horrible are the principles i have learned and try to in often at least but preferably many times per check in complete the first and second conflict it takes more than a day to make the functionality then the task is too large break it into smaller completable code should never be checked in since it is not is not a valid archival so whether code or code being commenting and checking in make any in if the code is not ready to go to the next stage that is for it should not be committed to a trunk or after reading the other answers and add that i think necessarily a good idea to commented code sure how enforce that what i will say is that you should get everyone on your team to buy in to the philosophy i described the team i work on embraces it as a source control is a frictonless one that helps us get our job who embrace that philosophy usually cause and are often frustrated by source they see it as a necessary evil at and something to avoid at which leads to infrequent which means changesets are huge and hard to which compounds makes checkins something to avoid even this is ultimately an attitude not really a process easy to put up mental barriers against easy to find reasons why it just like easy to find reasons not to diet if you really want but when people want to do it and are committed to changing their the results are the burden is on you to sell it

 method also allows derived classes to handle the event without attaching a this is the preferred technique for handling the event in a derived if i understand the above then if we derive a class from we should instead of subscribing to selectedindexchanged treat method as an event handler and thus put any event processing logic inside override void handling would that be better than subscribing to an via onselectedindexchanged in ascx file we use onselectedindexchanged attribute to attach event handler to an name of this attribute is the same as the name of why is why instead the name of this attribute selectedindexchanged attribute refers to an event and not to a method that calls this be sure that you call or the event you want anyone else to be able to respond to this then would it be perfectly ok not to call since i would think not calling it really do any harm besides not firing an event and thus event handlers be called realize some events need to be fired in order for framework to do its but what about not calling should derived classes handle an event without attaching a

 might be more of a question but it exist yet and i need more rep for when it does employer has a few hundred servers spread across several as i suspect is common we know how many servers we more than once been surprised to find a server been up for 5 apparently doing nothing but elevating the temperature we have a number of databases that store bits of server information our load various internal spreadsheets and so on but all very incomplete and maintaining this mess costs time and like to come up a single database which holds details of what each server is and replaces at least supplies data the databases mentioned the database and web interface are likely to be a rails app as this is what i have most experience more of a sysadmin than a this problem already been i find any open source software that really fits the bill and generally not too keen on gui should i implement the device information collection for be great to the database update device records when disks are added or or when the server serial number changes because hp replace the this information comes from many different disk snmp against the server or its onboard and so i could expose all this through custom scripts and or i could run a local poller that reported the information back to the central db via a restful interface or it must be easily you done tell me your mistakes and for a machine

 might be tricky of its nature or my way of describing so really read this before have this app to desktop no data layer in sense of files or any other repository need to store or load app will have some computation algorithms implemented provides gui which will display controls for app and computations am thinking about using mvc pattern but i have doubts how to use since i have no data layer in sense of database is generated during execution based on user i am concerned about way of using mvc in this so far i have came up with two is the geneticalgorithm is the geneticalgorithmresults is the model class that only stores basic view sends user input to the controller is processing user input and generates controller sends generated data to the model notifies the view about new view pulls new data and updates the is the appengine is the geneticalgorithm nad geneticalgorithmresults are the now we view sends user input to the controller is processing user input and sends control signals to the model updates its internal state new model notifies the controller about new controller pulls data to controller processes controller pushes processed data to the view updates the approach seems to be more straightforward and more like the problem is that some logic would have to be in the model decide when to notify the model as not all data updates will be or maybe display will be updated with the sets of data not every little those decisions will be based on user whats more some additional processing of the data may be needed before actual this would be in the the other hand second approach seems to be more complicated and looks like to much messages are being passed to achieve the but it gives full control of logic to the controller and separates responsibilities of the the controller and the model is the main purpose of approach would you or maybe i should mix them and use first approach architecture with communication flow from second or some different for desktop app with no data

 modeling a a project can have many people working on and a person can work on multiple modeling the relation as a project which in addition to serving as a link from person also records a roletype and of that person filling that roletype on that how the english work stands in for the database fk in a of those we can in the database follow the graph from through project to person a join b on project c on we can follow it in the other from person a join b on project c on like to be able to do the same in the so we want a person to have a and project to have a and a projectrole references to a person and a should really be unless we decide that is a convenience method of the p new projectrole have a it reference to a person and a reference to a it also as a start an end and a roletype either is an or a class instance that mimics an enum value that there is only one object per enum and immutable and and thus sharable among many this mean that retrieving a person from the database should cause the whole database to be reified in the object graph in the lazy proxies that retrieve only on use can save us from then if only currently concerned with the and not his roles we can just retrieve the for i think does this i think this is a standard way of representing standard for a relation to have additional data what kind pretty much got the right and are just being rightly conscientious in getting feedback	
 modern ides a lot of graphics and disk io going neither of which is performed well by so if your vm responds fast enough for the developers to then say no reason why if it you either need to get a faster machines for them or go back to documenting how to setup the build other factor against vms is that if you change the you have to do it for all and document the changes if telling everyone how to set up their you might as well let them set their own system up on the base we do have vmsa for this but they tend to be for old versions of the so we can still build it without having to install the old service sdks and its but i find installing everything locally and switching between them junction to point to the build is iirc vmware has a virtualisation project called that transparently puts a os environment onto your local so you can have several conflicting applications running not used but did look into it as something that might be better than whole guest vms running in their own

 most important point is that heap and stack are generic terms for ways in which memory can be they can be implemented in many different and the terms apply to the basic a stack of items sit one on top of the other in the order they were placed and you can only remove the top one toppling the whole thing like a stack of a there is no particular order to the way items are you can reach in and remove items in any order because there is no clear like a heap of licorice does a fairly good job of describing the two ways of allocating and freeing memory in a stack and a what extent are they controlled by the os or language heap and stack are general and can be implemented in many computer programs typically have a stack called a which stores information relevant to the current function such as a pointer to whichever function it was called and any local because functions call other functions and then the stack grows and shrinks to hold information from the functions further down the call a program really have runtime control over determined by the programming os and even the system heap is a general term used for any memory that is allocated dynamically and out of the memory is typically allocated by the with the application calling api functions to do this there is a fair bit of overhead required in managing dynamically allocated which is usually handled by the is their call stack is such a low level concept that it relate to in the sense of if you disassemble some code see relative pointer style references to portions of the but as far as a higher level language is the language imposes its own rules of one important aspect of a is that once a function anything local to that function is immediately freed from the that works the way expect it to work given how your programming languages in a also difficult to the scope is whatever is exposed by the but your programming language probably adds its rules about what a is in your the processor architecture and the os use virtual which the processor translates to physical addresses and there are page they keep track of what pages belong to which you never really need to worry about because you just use whatever method your programming language uses to allocate and free and check for errors the fails for any determines the size of each of it depends on the operating system and a stack is usually because by definition it must be contiguous memory on that in the last the language compiler or the os determine its you store huge chunks of data on the so be big enough that it should never be fully except in cases of unwanted endless recursion or other unusual programming heap is a general term for anything that can be dynamically depending on which way you look at it is constantly changing in modern processors and operating systems the exact way it works is very abstracted so you normally need to worry much about how it works deep except that languages where it lets you use memory that you allocated yet or memory that you have makes one stack is faster because all free memory is always no list needs to be maintained of all the segments of free just a single pointer to the current top of the compilers usually store this pointer in a fast for this subsequent operations on a stack are usually concentrated within very nearby areas of which at a very low level is good for optimization by the processor

 my answer where the is that all algorithms that come immediately to mind have n where n is the size of the whether you choose to do work on the or do work on the algorithm where lists are traded back and fourth may be as a size calculation is not although you still need to loop and compare with can prove this algorithm cannot be written faster than n by noting that the information about the last element in a queue is only available through knowing the size of the and that you must destroy data to get to that hence the 2nd only way to make this faster is to not to use queues in the first import def queue queue contains one item at a temp def stick it in the first is def the queues until q1 is ready to pop the right for n 0 to return def return def if return return

 my experience inodb is slighly faster for really simple pg for more complex myisam is probably even faster than innodb for but perhaps slower for mostly varchar are you indexing them with you normalize some of cost you on the but may save time on subsequent as your row size will thus fitting more rows into memory at one so you have two query time against the and updating the to the in my mysql myism is bad at on tables the size of your daily to 1m with rather wide flat i found it was faster to the table than to insert and wait for the and attendant disk this or might not select from the tables but no insert the new records as then create the indexes on new wait a drop old and rename new table to old in response to the fourth i know that myisam is always that i know in my particular i was at how much faster copying the table and then adding the index as it i was doing something similar to what you were copying large denormalized flat files into the and then renormalizing the but an not also think i found that overall innodb was given that i was doing as much inserting as a very special case of database that copying with a select as foo join was also faster than an update which as the update was to an indexed

 my opinion exception handling is not something generally acceptable for embedded gcc nor microsoft have exception both compilers insert prologue and epilogue statements into each function that track the scope of this leads to a measurable increase in performance and memory performance difference is something like in my which for my area of work is a huge the memory overhead was far less but still significant i remember the figure but with easy to compile your program both ways and measure the seen some people talk about exception handling as an if you use based on what observed this just when you enable exception handling it affects all whether a code path can throw exceptions or not makes total sense when you consider how a compiler would also stay away from rtti for embedded although we do use it in debug builds to sanity check downcasting

 my using vhdresizer and diskpart on a windows xp vhdresizer from these instructions from on this didnt on entering not sure on the exact wording but it was along the lines of cant extend this easiest way to do this long as you have enough hard drive is to extend your existing vhd using vhd expander which gives you two vhd the newly extended file will take the name of your existing you might want to and compact your vhd prior to extending your virtual pc 2007 go to your vhd as hard disk your newly extended vhd as hard disk your an command execute list select your new vhd volume by executing select volume where is your new vhd most likely execute you should see a success if not you may have to recreate your extended vhd due to an error in the by typing down the both vhd files from the hard disks your newly extended vhd as hard disk your will get a windows newly added hardware message after a short the vm when using your newly extended is information on extending volumes using the image virtual and virtual diskpart and expand the virtual disk disk 3 the number in the list part part 1 the number in the list part the new and save changes virtual and virtual can get download virtual server can do a custom install and only select more using with windows is not possible to use you can only use reason for this is that vhdmount uses vds virtual disk to assign a disk letter to the virtual hard disk after it is but vds is only included in windows server 2003 and this is not too big of an issue as unlike windows server windows xp will automatically mount the virtual hard disk when it is plugged this means that the only functionality you lose on windows xp is the ability to specify exactly which drive letter should be

 never had a problem with interpreting oracle error part of the reason is that every interactive tool seen for developing sql for oracle helpfully points to the location the query went that includes as others have and the perl dbi from prepare table or view does not exist error possibly near indicator at char 14 in from statement from at line that a bit hard to read since all squished on one but a gui tool would be able to point to the token where oracle started having problems with the and given a bit of work on a you could write a tool to pick out the offending answer the underlying oracle errors seem to be designed to work the way you as far as i can none of the the error messages in oracle support variable oracle returns two bits of an error number and a location where the error if you have proper pretty easy to diagnose an error with those pieces of it can be argued that system is nicer to tool creators than one which provides variable amounts of diagnostic data depending on the imagine having to write a custom parser for all of error messages future to highlight the offending including the table name would be just knowing where things went wrong can be a huge select from where dummy from where dummy at line invalid table for why oracle chose to do thing this i have some used this style of error message for system which larry bob miner and ed oates copied to build oracle number and location are the smallest possible representation of diagnostic i indicated to simplify the creation of tools that connect to any i think you need to be a dba to figure out which table you just need to use the proper adjust your i	
 never heard of this technique it just looks interesting so done a few searches and what i think found hopefully someone who knows what talking about will contribute think supposed to be a better way of generating branch coverage not a complete substitute for path a far longer document here which restates the goals a onjava article says goal of basis path testing is to test all decision outcomes independently of one testing the four basis paths achieves this making the other paths think here to the goal of basis path not as one might complete waste of think the point of testing branches is to break those accidental correlations between the paths which and the paths you that occur with terrifying frequency when i write both the code and an arbitrary set of branch coverage tests no magic in the linear just a systematic way of generating branch which discourages the tester from making the same assumptions as the programmer about correlation between branch basis path testing misses your and in general misses where n is the cyclomatic it just aims not to miss the paths likely to be as letting the coder choose n paths to test typically does

 no one brings up the fact that if you actually buy sql server at 5k you might want to use it for more than your web if your using maybe you i see sql servers run databases for 20 to 30 so putting it on the webserver would not be depends on whom the server is i do work for financial companies and the so we use a crazy pain in the arse approach of using only sprocs and limiting ports from webserver to so if the web app gets the only thing the hacker can do is call sprocs as the user account on the webserver is locked down to only sprocs on the so now the hacker has to figure out how to get into the if its on the web server well its kind of easy to get

 not so daily coding practice to use this could be considered something as an advanced starting from this simple important to better understand concepts behind the word terms of and taking it simple as an appdomain is an isolation container even in terms of memeory inside it all the assemblies needed by an application are loaded and even if this concept is more complicated to explain in details hope not about yor question to going so from the appdomain class first of all is used to obtain access to the application related executing application this could be done viea the singleton property implementation in this way possible access the loaded access to the data in terms of unwrapping created instances from loaded assemblies in created the appdomain class is used more in the same assemblies in the the could be usefull to take a view of the code of the new microsoft framework yet extesibility which is truly based on concepts like appdomains creations and dynamically loaded a simple example of things and examples of what you can do with i can share this hope i answered your

 not sure if entirely clear on the implications of attaching to events in is my current correct or attaching to local class events do not need to be new event eventhandler onmycustomevent delegate assuming that when your object is disposed or garbage the functions are deallocated and would automatically detach from the attaching to objects you no longer need have to be detached to a elapsed which you only respond to i would assume you need to store the timer in a local variable so you can detached the elapsed event after the event declaring the timer in a local method scope like so would result in a mydatatimer new new attaching to events in a local object to your class does not require if you had an observablecollection that your and lets if you attached to the collectionchanged event using a private this function deallocate when your class is garbage causing the observablecollection to also be sure i have places where stopped using objects and have failed to detach from an event the timer example i so looking for a clearer explanation on how this what cases are detaching from events	
 not sure if i should my own or use a comment for but here understanding is that volatile prevents optimizations from moving the accesses to my result variables the completed such that the the thread that reads the result will see want the boolean made visible to all threads the due to compiler or emmpry you want the writes to the results being seen after the further on the in regards to items mentioned by matt i should point out whenever a thread calls an the cpu forces so if you are variables via interlocked do not have to worry about all of memory model thread synchronization locks call interlocked it would seem as pointed that the result do not require the volatile keyword the example as shown since manualresetevent ensures you are both in agreement that such an operation takes care of caching between processors or in registers does it prevent reording to guarantee such that both the results are assigned the completed and that the completed flag is assigned true the manualresetevent is my initial assumption was the background thread potentially run multiple obviously overlooked the name of class given it is only run it is not to me why the calls in the manner that what is the point of initialwaitms milliseconds if background thread may or may not done at the time why not just kickoff background thread and use a lock synchronize access to the variables or simply execute contents of the function part of the thread that is there a reason to do concept of the sample is to execute a if the task can be completed within an exceptable amount of then the calling thread will get access to the result and continue with normal but sometime a task can take quite a long time and the claiing thread cannot be blocked for that period and can take reasonable steps to deal with that can include checking back later on the operation using the completed concrete a dns resolve is often very quick and worth waiting for even from a but sometimes it can take many many so by using a utility class like the one could gets a result easily from the of the caller of the time and not lock up the gui the other one could use a background but that can be overkill for an operation that the vast majority of the time need all that it seems to me that not some kind of locking mechanism on results variables is still a it is not needed the code as result completed data is meant to be if i added a lock to assign the results and also have to lock in my result and i never liked seeing getters lock just to return a data from my such locking is not if an operation has 5 or 6 the caller has to take and release the lock 5 or 6 times at some down the another thread may along and try to access the would be better in my mind to for this possibility now rather try to track down mysterious anomalies i have a volatile completed flag that is guarenteed to be set the volatile results and the only access to the results is through the and as mentioned in the an exception is thrown if the getter is called and the operation is not yet expect that the completed and result getters can be invoked by a thread other than the one that called my hope i believe this to be true with the volatiles

 not sure the question is windows go out to the mapped network share to read the necessary code page in from disk or will it make a copy of it locally when first code must be in local memory to be a page fault on a network mapped drive will cause network to fetch the appropriate which will be loaded into local memory and then this since the image exists on a remote share assuming the page fault handler must go out to the network share to retrieve the code is this the page fault handler know the drive is network it will issue a file system the network mapping driver will intercept that and convert it into a network so the page fault handler is just doing its normal it know doing voodoo in the have an application running in this manner and periodically it seems to the system but the system becomes responsive after a short period of sometimes just a few seconds and in other cases this system also has a lot of and dlp products installed on it and thus several tdi filter drivers and file system filter drivers which seemingly would add to the latency in processing the page fault especially if the code must be paged in from a process image that exists on a remote with that much kernel hacking stuff on it my first thought is that your windows installation is simply stuff is poison to windows and you seem to have a ton of stuff jacked into the kernel you are for and it seems trouble has come explanations are most given the amount of badware you have most likely windows is just you need a deeper technical

 not sure what you mean with internet there is no other way to connect a client to the internet than using an the internet is a set of machines that has different tasks and your isp provides you with routing and bandwidth so you are able to connect to other i say what you can for example you spoof your ip address by sending packets with another ip but this is by it has to do with how traffic are not an active the router expects you to have your assigned ip and understand any other route and ping are using icmp to explore the read more about on icmp is not used by some routers for security or performance nat is also invisible to and domain lookup etc is using databases that store information about host a good article on wikipedia about use wireshark and go to a domain you visited before to see dns in domain lookups is useful to learn if domains looks valid for example trust an internet bank with an hotmail address as its contact scans for services and non filtered ports by using different kinds of port sniffing some hosts will automatically block you if you as port sniffing are usually used by hackers to find exploitable port scanning yourself is an excellent way to test your security and find

 not totally clear on what but this is what it sounds know how to use post and aka html to pass data between using javascript are a couple of interpretations of you doing something like my my my something my and 3 are examples of using javascript to make the buttons do 4 is a standard html form button javascript is not being the standard html form behaviors will cause the button to submit the data to whatever page is specified in the form tag like the thing to understand is that are ways to send data around between webpages between the browser and the the process of sending the data around can be triggered by html javascript function that calls a url or triggers that a form get or form elements like not intending any but the way you asked your question makes me think that not trying to figure out different formats to transfer the data to the receiving page other posters and figuring out how to parse cookie values or iterate through your form fields to create a query string would be really here are some your form was already using javascript to submit the form or 3 you just add the same onclick part to an html my function submitmyform might look something like get the form object you can also do this with the var myform use the submit method of the form in add a javascript behavior to a normal html anchor one note in users expect the rule go buttons do not a hard and fast but people generally are happier when a button is used for things like submitting form

 observed that message before but i think it was the same cause the not is a generic rpc error which can be caused by many our particular it was because we were hammering wmi too hard and not cleaning up our but it appears to be a different cause in your know you said you want to shorten the parameter but that may be the only way forward for having a hard time visualizing the circumstances under which you need to send 6m across an rpc perhaps if you explain the reasons behind we can help possibilities based on comments to the rpc calls limit the amount of data that travels across the this could be done by segmenting the message at the source and reconstructing it at the such as having three parameters could have the server dole out message identifiers in another rpc call or find some other way to ensure no two clients have the same a message identifier tying message segments a last flag begin the reconstruction a limited size segment xml is ripe for the 7zip libraries are the best seen in terms of size whether this would be fast enough is another fix by changing the out the registry area for the rpcmaxsize there are a couple of sites googled that suggest setting this to will remove size limitations so be fix while registering your can apparently achieve the same effect as on a specific interface with

 of support for but i have to every language has plusses and minuses achieve a better balance than of being for a first convinced most people will learn to more effectively with a language that have an cycle is inherently slower for you as the programmer has garbage collection has good runtime best of if there is an interactive evaluator as to mess about not is almost invariably faster in such there are fewer things to trip you and there are better tools to help figure what went wrong when it to say learning the vagaries of memory management in a language like something worth it just the place you really want to issue with is that for all its practicality the sheer size of it added to the fact it has incompatible parts that can lead to subtle issues best avoided as a john d brings up the point in a comment that some people who learn first on a language is by no means limited to never learn pointers this is a red some people fail to learn all sorts of for all sorts of i maintain that worrying about pointers is a distraction when learning the at some point you may well need to learn about manual memory but not fundamentally important to do this at or more the gains made by avoiding this are more important than the me be clear not saying that is an inferior choice for a first language because it lacks garbage just one of many issues that get in the way of learning the fundamentals of programming the real problem is that it is a large complicated with quirks all over the place and even internal inconsistencies pointers and exceptions play well of course all of this can be managed properly and you can learn good practice to keep from getting in none of this will make much sense to a real neophyte at so some of learning it will end up being it this not that i said so you understand the details hardly an auspicious bigges gains for learning a first language though are probably in avoiding a cycle any and having good

 often cited that ror and similar frameworks based on dynamic languages are more productive but i am really interested to know if there are hard data to back this this be as one should be made certain that she is not comparing apples with things like type of project enterprise and team size should be taken into for small projects it is more than evident that such frameworks are indeed far more productive than java so this is a short list of arguments used to support this and what you can do for them in the java is a more intuitive and concise you can do the same thing with much less think you can have the same thing in unless of course you use a dynamic language that runs in the jvm your ide can in jave an ide is an essential tool and it will pay you back if you learn to use it well in fact there are many things you can do with a java ide that are simply impossible to do with a ruby or python plus you have the benefits of a static typed it may take more time to but it helps you avoid common is much more fun to makes the developer happier and more as highly subjective argument in my opinion over configuration makes things dependency injection framework like spring or guice can mvc already there for java mvc frameworks can made load database items as can change the database on the ibatis or another orm framework can with you can achieve similar functionality with what you have in ror with yml new modules or ant ivy can deployment for ide or jetty can in fact debugging is easier with integrated with the use of mock objects facilitate dependency injection framework can help with mock junit was a pioneer of unit i think that java is less easy to

 only obvious thing is that got a state flag for which way to increment but not testing it in your first it would be better to structure your code a bit you also may want to track more than one value if you have more than one unless they all should fade in and out at the same in that case be best off with an array of with the parameters for each way of using delay with multiple tasks is to have each task work on the time elapsed since the last and adjust the delay at the end of your loop for the time the tasks if your loop is something unsigned long set to in unsigned long unsigned long time unsigned long delta time delta delta delta delta as tasks may have taken some adjust delay unsigned long if each task will be run about once every and will be passed 20 or so as the number of milliseconds to update their state so you get some but everything has a chance to

 only way i think this is achievable is through something similar to multiversion concurrency protocol used in databases such as this guarantees that readers block writers block but writers block only those writers which update the same piece of this property of writers blocking the which update the same piece of data is important in concurrent programming otherwise inconsistencies are for each and every write operation to the data structure you take a snapshot of the data structure or atleast the portion of the nodes affected by the write operation to a different location in the memory before doing the so when the write is in a reader thread requests to read a portion of data from the writer you always refer to the latest snapshot iterate over that there by providing consistent view of data to all the are costly since they consume more but yes for your given this technique is the right one to go and yes use locks to protect the write operation from other writer needing to update the same piece of

 only way to really do this is how the does is by setting an interval that keeps checking the current and comparing it against what it was we do this and let subscribers subscribe to a changed event that we fire if the hash its not perfect but browsers really support this event to keep this answer you are using jquery today should be somewhat foundational for then a nice solution is to use the abstraction that jquery gives you by using its events system to listen to hashchange events on the window work nice thing here is you can write code that need to even worry about hashchange however you do need to do some in form of a somewhat lesser known jquery feature special this feature you essentially get to run some setup code for any the first time somebody attempts to use the event in any way as binding to the this setup code you can check for native browser support and if the browser natively implement you can setup a single timer to poll for and trigger the jquery completely unbinds your code from needing to understand this support the implementation of a special event of this kind is trivial get a simple working but why do that somebody else has

 orm will always add some overhead because of the layers of abstraction but unless it is a poorly designed orm that should be the time to actually query the database will be many times more than the additional overhead of the orm infrastructure if you are doing it for example not loading the full object graph when not a good orm will also give you many options for the queries run against the database so you can optimise as required as

 people ask a question like i like to think to myself would happen if this were actually i really know what this would but i guess it would have something to do with being able to override the constructor implementation based on the dynamic type of the object being see a number of potential problems with for one the derived class will not be fully constructed at the time the virtual constructor is so there are potential issues with the what would happen in the case of multiple your virtual constructor would be called multiple times you would then need to have some way of know which one was being generally speaking at the time of the object does not have the virtual table fully this means it would require a large change to the language specification to allow for the fact that the dynamic type of the object would be known at construction this would then allow the base class constructor to maybe call other virtual functions at construction with a not fully constructed dynamic class as someone else has pointed out you can implement a kind of virtual constructor using static or type functions that basically do the same thing as a virtual constructor would

 playing with this a and seeing the caveats with allocconsole and i think the best idea is to have two exe say and when you need console use of your code other than your main function can be placed into a project which produces a dll this includes all win including your main the only thing left in the exe project is a small main function which in turn calls a static function in your all of this can be done without resorting to your dll class public class private static bool misconsole private public static bool get return public static int bool misconsole do whatever main program return dos return catch if return dos return code indicating your project which emits a windows exe this is the only static class static int return your project which emits a console exe this is the only static class static int return in both exe you need a reference to the dll project in the same on the application tab of project you can change the project type windows app console app or class library that it is possible to programatically determine if an exe file uses the windows or console but it is probably not worth it lots of and you have to look at the bytes of the exe pe the methods are funny in that if you run your program from the command line or a batch and try to redirect the output to a it wil not work it will not go to the see possible to work but it requires more and probably not worth a best i never put more into an exe project than the simple main function that in turn calls a static function in a there are a lot of but one good reason is that unit testing tools work better with dlls than with also the form of the main function which takes a string array of and returns an this is the best form to because you can use errorlevel in batch files to work with whatever number your exe returns traditionally 0 for success and larger than 0 for

 point to daniel disadvantage of anonymous inner classes is that no one can ever use it anywhere whereas a named inner class can be used only by the class that created it if made a small but it does mean that you can help ensure that an inner class is not accidentally recreated using the anonymous inner class gives anyone reading your code a harder time as they then have to parse this class that came out of using a named inner class you are able to organize the source have seen cases where there are two anonymous inner classes with the exact same in guis especially you may have multiple controls performing the same this can crop up i am talking production not code that my students have readability issue goes both some people find anonymous inner classes better as it lets you see what is going on in once others find it a that part comes down to personal making an class static is more if you are declaring an anonymous inner class in an instance then there will be more if you need access to the instance is wasteful probably not worth worrying about until it presents as a personal preference is to use classes as they allow for more flexibility when the code is modified

 possible to code a more general solution to this the following works in python of the level of define for e in if yield yield the requested negation function can be coded as for some collection of arbitrarily nested we calculate its negation like noted by user the above function yields a generator which may contain other generators which to all these we need to apply to all of so we define another general mapping this time one that works on the iterables def if return return return actually negate every element right away and return the complete that we can regard a nested collection of iterables as a each iterable is a while are hence the first function i defined works on and the second function works on

 possible way to implement the queue processor is to use a signaling condition if you are on a posix compliant could have n number of waiting in the time something is shoved in the queue your semaphore sends signal is received by sleeping threads which start processing the queue because they know they have the thread finishes processing check queue size to see if it should grab something if not then go back to waiting for a	
 possibly even though certainly not has changed the keyboard mapping in visual studio and i cannot figure out how to get it back to the symptom that i see as the problem is that when i type the name of a class which is not in a namespace listed in the using statements at the top of the shortcut to add that namespace to the file which by has been changed to there are probably other key settings but this is one that is really annoying me at the i have already tried to fix the problem which have not press reset additional mapping scheme is set to but i have also tried vc neither fixed the import and export developer from the know that i could probably fix just this one key binding by customizing but i want to do i want to reset of the key binding spec to their default do i fix this visual studio keyboard mapping

 post in using a history table per base table and a comment by karl about possible performance done a bit of sql research in order to figure out the fastest possible way to transfer a record from one table to just wanted to document what i thought that i would have to do an sql fetch to load the record from the base followed with an sql push to put the record into the history followed by an update to the base table to insert the changed total of 3 to my surprise i realized that you can do the first two transactions using one sql statement using the select into betting performance would be a hundred fold faster doing that would leave us to simply update the record with the new data within the base still found one sql statement to do all 3 transactions at once doubt i

 posted looks fine from a although i could be it would appear that any other code that does some using the foo should be i see any in the that section of few things worth noting anyway from being very careful with deadlocks and testing rigourously to insure they best to put a lock around the code within the as i believe in certain circumstances that methods can be called before the constructor block has finished please correct me if wrong on this object in this case is which is if it were protected or internal you would certainly have to be cautious about how other code utilised the object fact i think it would be best to almost declare such objects as done locking the right always safest to lock on a separate private instance object because you that object be locked by any other code than your own the case if you lock or the object i may be missing and there is a small possibility that some other code not shown above might cause but as far as i can see it that code flawed except for a missing lock around the constructor more likely to have to watch out for deadlock situations when you start doing more complex especially across hope that	
 posted several times but no one would give me an answer that i can understand in plain i am new to other cool libs or tools you may advise me so keep that in am using with web forms also have ajax but used it is my need to implement a functionality that is going to use treeview parent page will display a treeview and a user will be able to click on the which will trigger a pop where a user will enter some pop up will save the info to the return a result value to the parent window and the parent window should be updated to reflect the pretty common scenario from what i my question is what is the simplest way to achieve this while keeping in mind that i have to minimize the number of trips between the client and a web i posted this several times and no one seems to have an answer to my this is fairly so please if anyone has had any real dev experience with this share you treeview node from a pop up window while mimimizing

 powershell commands offer a	
 powershell if i have a list of strings containing versions etc how can i sort it the way would sort it in powershell	
 prefer	
 prefer the first for code the readability i think that lambda is clearer than the second in the first case you are using a strongly type way to sort your entity which is on the second case you are passing the field and the order in a string mmmm dont like	
 prefer the second while there are not much difference between the you are basically the functionality of the primary method in the overload and the primary overload would work perfectly without caring about existence of lack of the other so there is more separation of concerns in the overload	
 prefer the t4 here is the ctor provided public dataprovider is also an overload that accepts a connection this is working quite well for using the linq support and it is full of	
 prefer to use stl containers as an rather than as part of my this way i can change containers for deque or if the need arises without any of the calling code being you may have to write a few call through functions but the encapsulation is worth the extra	
 prefer vb to most of the but pretty fluent in the top of my head there are two places i know where makes it one is that you ever have to check for before raising an there might be some but not aware of other is the addition of the you can declare a full method to handle event and wire it up to the event in one this is a definite advantage for because you could still do everything in long form without that just an extra little piece of syntactic the only way you can do that in is with a lambda rest of the syntax is pretty much a do you prefer or	
 preferable method would be to use a converter called that is used in binding the visibility property to the data authenticationstate	
 preference if for statement statement statement statement no different statement statement i always use them because it is consistent and it avoids problems forgetting to add them in other people will look at my code and think that it is stupid to put in the and they have their i have i happen to like my reasons more than i like theirs	
 preference would be c or because not separated from the machine language by a jit want to do intense performance and that means stepping through the hot spots one instruction at a time to see what it is and then tweaking the source code so as to generate optimal you get the compiler to generate what you consider good enough assembler then by all means write your own assembler for the hot describing a situation where the need for performance is i would not do if i were in your shoes is rely on anecdotal generalizations about one language being faster or slower than what i would do is multiple passes of intense performance tuning along the lines of and and i have done this sort of thing numerous and the key is to iterate the cycle of because every slug fixed makes the remaining ones more until you literally squeeze another cycle out of that is it the case that there is some configuration information that determines how the bulk of the data is if it may be that the program is spending a lot of its time the configuration info to figure out what to do if it is usually a big win to write a that will read the configuration info and generate an program that can whizz through the data without constantly having to figure out what to

 pretty much agree with all that carl meyer wonder how stack overflow handles original question give much specific information about the intended use expected load requests per hosting assuming that the load is i would recommend using just apache with or apache with and s3 for static file recently became the recommended way to deploy see given this you should expect this method to see a lot of and therefore a lot of and blog graham dumpleton also recently release which looks quite mature used it can put nginx in front of apache to proxy dynamic and serve static this setup serves many people the nginx wiki has good tutorials on setting this but this also gives you two sets of config files to and two http servers to keep only you could use apache to serve static use in deamon mode to handle then split up the requests by url so that static file requests do not invoke the wsgi django but are handled by apache this is again well see your favorite apache book for location or see the apache this at least your so that you only need to learn apache and to keep apache simple way to go would be to use apache for all dynamic django and put all static content on amazon depending on your expected use frequency of updating static this might be the very amazon lists a couple of freeware applications to make working with s3 such as bucket explorer

 previously clients is not for nio augmented with a separate threadpool to handle each request without blocking the nio is usual way to handle a large amount of depending on threads might actually but it depends a lot on how much interaction there is between client massive threads are more likely to work if there is little synchronization between the nio is notoriously difficult to get right the first time you implement recommend either trying or at least looking at the source for the naga nio lib at the codebase for the lib is small compared to most other nio you should be able to quickly implement a test to see if you can get clients up and naga source also happens to be free to modify or copy without attributing the original

 problem with pointers is not the the execution and language additional confusion results when teachers assume that the concept of pointers and not the or the convoluted mess c and makes of the so vast amounts of effort are poored into explaining the concept in the accepted answer for this and pretty much just wasted on someone like because i already understand all of just explaining the wrong part of the give you an idea of where coming someone who understands pointers perfectly and i can use them competently in assembler because in assembler language they are not referred to as they are referred to as when it comes to programming and using pointers in i make a lot of mistakes and get really i still have not sorted this let me give you an an api is a pointer to the does it could number representing an address to a give it do i say or number representing the address to an address to a that or or number representing the address to the address to the address to the or is it or even so and the language involved make it as clear because it involves the words and that hold as much meaning and clarity to me as holds the address to and function requires an address to the answer additionally depends on just what the heck is to begin and what doit intends to do with the language support the levels of nesting that are encountered in like when i have to hand a in to a function that creates a new and it modifies the pointer to point at the new location of the does it really want the or a pointer to the so it knows where to go to modify the contents of the most of the time i just have to guess what is meant by and most of the time regardless of how much experience i get at is just too is a pointer an address to a or is it a variable that holds an address to a when a function wants a does it want the address that the pointer variable or does it want the address to the pointer

 programming can be amazingly however you be hiring programmers in you force developers to pair it only works when two developers click and decide they can learn from each other and build something awesome my advice is to hire as many of the smartest developers you can find and put them in a setting that naturally lends itself to encouraging pair developers need to be able to code but also talk to others on the team about the right mix that works for you and your company will be more art than and certainly not something you can do by blindly following the demands of some published the more bugs you squash before they ever get checked the more you save in the long having another developer looking on as you architect something will always be more effective than having a tester it call it money well

 proper way is to look at the http header sent to the this contains the weighted list of languages the user has configured their browser to this header is not available for reading inside all you get is which tells you what localised version of the web browser was this is not necessarily the same thing as the preferred on ie you instead get systemlanguage installed browserlanguage as and userlanguage configured os which are all similarly i had to choose between those sniff for falling back to and only after that those match any available looking at and finally you can put a script somewhere else on the net that simply reads the header and spits it back out as a javascript file with the header value in the you could include a pointing at that external service in the and use javascript to parse the language i know of any existing library code to do since parsing is almost always done on the server you end up you certainly need a user override because it will always guess wrong for some often easiest to put the language setting in the url vs and let the user click links between the sometimes you do want a single url for both language in which case you have to store the setting in but this may confuse user agents with no support for cookies and search

 provide an abstraction layer for your domain you can therefore change the model and not break the contract you have for your service this is akin to a common practice in database design where views and procedures become the abstraction layer for the underlying data you may over expose data and send bloated messages over the this may be mitigated by using serialization but you may still have extra explicit contracts by exposing domain objects you leave it up to the client to interpret their usage since they do not have the full model at their you will often make updates to domain objects implicitly based on the presence or removal of or blindly accept all dtos explicitly express the usage of the service and the desired scenarios having explicit messages or dtos would make it easier for you to implement messaging and messaging patterns such as message pure ddd demands that domain objects are externally and therefore you must offload this to another typically a

 real code you are referring to is usually called a good unit testing your unit tests should be in their own classes probably their own so that be an rest is language based for the most the more advanced a the better ability to avoid writing support code to some a development system can help you avoid writing a lot of code screen ruby on but these abstractions can break down and cause you to write just as much code as anything else if you use it to develop targets outside intended types of ruby help all that much if calculating prime the you have art of eliminating all the supporting code that you can well as redundancies in your business to keep your clean and practicing advanced probably end up writing tools for abstracting data out of your code and into a structured file of some sort can eliminate huge piles of support code and move the rest into because now parsing that data and setting it up is part of the your program is a good because this type of business logic tends to be more readable and easier to the other advantage of this kind of abstraction is that all your is now done in data which tends to make it somebody an example of this type of rails it takes a lot of the boilerplate of web development and factors it out of the code and into libraries driven by data and simplistic code blurs the line between code and data files actually loop back to being specified in ruby

 real value in hungarian notation dates back to c programming and the weakly typed nature of back in the day the easiest way to keep track of the type was to use languages like the type system tells you all you need to and the ide presents this to you in a very user friendly way so there is simply no need to use for good reason to not use well there are quite a in and for that matter and many other langause you often create your own so what would be the hungarian for a even if you can decide on sensible hungarian notations it still makes the actual variable name slightly harder to read because you have to skip past the at the more important is the maintainance cost what if you start of with a list and change to another type of collection i seem to do a lot at the you then need to rename all your variables that use that all for no real if you had just used a decent name to begin with you have to worry about your what if you created or used some more meaningful type for holding a path you then need to change your to which is a pain and in this case not actually very

 really is this your personal repo or is it a repo that is shared by many how far into the project are i commit to my subversion repositories when i am done with one aspect and everything it does not have to be just not i prefer to not leave things broken in the first written code can get checked but only in my personal generally with notes about what i was doing at the time and what still needs to get since i use subversion and this is my personal repo i use this mainly to be able to leave my desktop and pick back up where i left off on my the one per commit is but may not suit your development if this is a more complete project it may work out since commits mean that you are crossing items off a list somewhere and it means one more item that is now things to what is significant about the changes that it warrants checking for i checked in code last night that significantly changed an internal this meant i had to document the changes in the commit message as well as the at the same time i also changed a few comments to fix that gets a small on the commit but is not something i consider a big enough issue to get committed on its	
 really love the idea of it as i can create a folder for my user and make sub folder and put local resource so the whole thing is contained in one and that makes it really efficient for me the bugger is you cant get intellisence like global so is it possible in any way to get stronly typed local resource

 really meant for this conditional compilation and it honestly sounds like a recipe for ending up in you could manually start dealing with functions that return the version of your you then have a classfile that fits a specific but with no indications that it may be encountered this situation before working with different versions of and not what i ended up doing is having an interface with two different one for each put each of them in a separate project in my and then tried to load them with a factory or an isolate them as well as you	
 really need some help the owner of a sql server database application that lost three days i understand how or here is the server 2005 32bit standard edition database on windows 2000 is in simple recovery database is connected as a subscriber to another server 2005 64bit enterprise edition on win2k3 using sql server continuous merge was rebooted on night x as part of scheduled when the database came back up it was used as normal for a couple of days and data was created into it perfectly then yesterday day x 4 it lost a lot of b is on a server with another instance of sql server and they both started to run out of with each is the sequence of events from the event log when i think this 2 is marked for unload due to memory 2 log with or with is simple recovery model should be used to automatically truncate the transaction 3 know the data is missing because of my audit logs and that a user had taken a screen shot of some of the data before it was here is my could this have can several days data go missing from subsequently is missing from the publication db the truncate with the appdomain down cause the data to be flushed from the and all theories if anyone needs more data i can add would a sql server 2005 database lose a few days

 really need to understand forms and css to get i say forms as this will give you the round trip needed to understanding the stateless nature of web further labour the i have interviewed many people who think you can only have one form on a page and can only have one submit button per this is all down to a lack of foundation for that recommend starting with a lot of web development is done with gone are the days where you do it yourself but my above point still you do need to be able to peep under the hood with some been doing web development for 12 years and started out with perl on solaris and since then also done java and more recently slowly falling for django in my private found over the years is that the inherent problems authentication are all the same but just handled so ultimately its down to you and your language plus a little of enlightened self interest when it comes to potential you should also become familiar with web servers and iis spring to http codes and mime types and encoding and as well as javascript browser platforms and good development practises such as using fiddler and so it also hurt to have a good idea of the image formats image css content caching and the depends on where you want to a pick django and clean language with cheap startup low cost ides and hosting your sites is very just a subjective	
 really not sure how to approach but i am subscribing to events fired within a custom class and ideally i wish to queue them and handle them first in first out as they come i am aware of and i think i should use but my question is in the event handler when my message is would i simply to the queue and if then how can the queue be crunched through as new items are was considering calling a method in the constructor which performs something like on to your foreach item in there must be a more elegant way to do this should effectively hit myqueue and iterate as it contains elements and do what i want what would performance be i can spawn this on a separate thread to avoid any thread i just really have a had time accepting through list in a thread continually as it receives new

 really should consider using a javascript library like or this will help to get the browser specific code out of the the visibility on the state of the rather than just toggling is probably a better style in this situation instead of if you use then you will just get a blank area where the should be when of a you probably want to pass in the id of the div tag and the id of the in would be your is the area you want to is your	
 really should never be considered as a legal really about doing the right looking at the legal side of first think common sense and politeness to the original legal aspect should really come as a second the work resulting from your under the gpl would certainly be the best way to handle javascript software you are using as a starting point was to you by its author under the and the best way to thank for the gift is to give your own contribution under the gpl if for some reason the gpl is not possible for then you really have two the original author and get approval for your and the license you want to use on your own the original copyright holder could even allow you to either make a proprietary derivative of this original work or to license it under both gpl and another license of your choice to any gpl restriction you may not start from that and create your own php software independently from the javascript implementation but the idea learned from reading the javascript ideas from gpl code is a valid way to thank the original author whatever license you

 really tried audiofilestream api for this rolled our own but a few things you have to take care you have no problem the byte then you have to keep tracking the relationship between mp3 frame number and the absolute byte stream just as paul i assume you can do that in your by calling audiofilestreamseek along the the trickier when you do random you have to reset the internal states of because it might be in some intermediate state expecting the next incoming bytes to complete the current not sure if you can just feed zeros to have it skip the current and start over you have to as i see anything like audiofilestreamreset in the the audio queue does have reset function that you can clean up at any rate you have to take care of your too because going to parse a part of the byte stream which you already have kept track you just find the start of a mp3 frame by relying on the second and the even with rate mp3 there can be paddings every other few so the most accurate information still comes from the should quickly add that another way to do random seeking is simply the parsed packets if not playing a really long and large frame index can be calculated from the frame header for non vbr frames per second is a constant frames per sec for khz stereo check out mp3 spec for why

 really want to synchronize on an since you have control over what instances are the same and what instances are java just provide such a facility using integers in a small that is dependable across different if you really must synchronize on an then you need to keep a map or set of integer so you can guarantee that getting the exact instance you would be to create a new perhaps stored in a that is keyed by the to synchronize something like page page p if synchronized p locks new object integer return explain this it uses which allows use of you could do new then you incur the cost of creating an object for each to avoid i just save the integer itself in the what does this why is this any different from just using the integer you do a from a the keys are compared with at least the method used is the equivalent of using two different integer instances of the same value will be equal to each you can pass any number of different integer instances of as the parameter to and you will always get back only the very first instance that was passed in that contained that are reasons why you may not want to synchronize on you can get into deadlocks if multiple threads are synchronizing on objects and are thus unwittingly using the same locks when they want to use different you can fix this risk by using new and thus incurring a small cost to each access to the doing you guarantee that this class will be doing its synchronization on an object that no other class will be synchronizing always a good	
 reason being that i suspect most people are taught to implement it using a class and a the following haskell sortby compare sortby sortby the strategy pattern in and are the concrete strategies in this case plain old and the function signature a is the strategy brevity of this illustrates that design patterns have to be so heavyweight or the way you want to implement strategy in java is a good a way that works around java giving you the wrong abstractions for the job you need to this should be considered normal or that assuming my assumption about the way taught is i like the strategy pattern very are some of other patterns which are also specific instances of the general i like them very much for very much the same

 reason this is happening is that when an image is specified in a css and that image is missing the routing framework tries to map the url to a ignoring the routes as listed below will prevent the error from but i decided not to implement it because a nice way of being notified that you have a missing can see a detailed explanation along with examples of setting up dependency injection using structure map was having the same issue and i think i figured it for whatever reason whenever you try to provide your own controller factory you need to add a couple of additional ignoreroute the first thing i would do is add this line to your getcontrollerinstance return will at least give you more information in the error message as to what the request is that is causing the controllertype to be in my particular case i had a background image in my css file set like what happens is the routing is looking for a controller called and an action that takes or something along those obviously not the correct some digging i realized i needed to add an ignoreroute definition to my file that would ignore anything in the directory of my site like still not sure why you need to do this with the default but nonetheless it probably run into the same issue with particularly if you using google need to add this as new

 reason why it is not safe to instanciate a vector of is that there is an algorithm that will do a copy of one object in your container on the implements quicksort which needs a therefore deleting it when going out of scpope of the well any or function of your own that are able to take your container as and copy one of its object on the stack will cause this issue as a in your it is simple you must ensure your class does not behaves as an or ensure you will never call such that can delete your underlying the first solution is according to me your copy constructor and your affectation operator as should not give away property of the pointer best way to achieve that is to wrapp a boost smart pointer instead of an to make your container safe when calling such the way according to defining a better copy operator to bypass this issue is not a good i see a good copy constructor implementation affectation operator as that could keep safe the result of applying the	
 reason why this happens is that when a plugin is invoked from the command line like it has no phase or execution associated with this means it picks up the unnamed execution which is the config outside the execution you really want to run multiple bind them to a phase and then invoke that in this case each execution will run with its own real unasked question here is why you are using to deploy a bunch of stuff like if 3rd party you should get a repo manager like and upload them once to a repository for your whole team to	
 reason you get that error is that the default constructor for a wcf client proxy looks up the channel configuration from local you can override this behavior by specifying the binding and address you want to use connect have several options each with a different deployment the endpoint information in your library common term for this is you would just return new for this only distribute the assembly your wsgateway code was in called a common configuration file that all sites have access if these are all services on the same this is easy to place configuration data in a shared common drive location and read it from if you want the full gamut of possible wcf configuration to be need to use the method and read it manually and apply it manually to your binding before your open the client for this you would ensure you centrally located config file was accessible and distribute you wsgateway your configuration to a common resource accessible from all like a this would allow you to access this configuration data from any point in your for this you would ensure your configuration database was accessible from all points in your solution and distribute your wsgateway are the solutions i could think of off the top of my let us know what you decide to

 recently been working on some database search functionality and wanted to get some information like the average words per document text field in the the only thing i have found so far processing in language of choice outside the seems to but do you have other currently using mysql 4 to move to version 5 for this app but am also interested in general i can imagine that this is a pretty rough way to determine this as it does not account for html in the content and the like as ok for this particular project but again are there better to define what i mean by either more performs more or is more to good for the content i have the query above is fast enough and is accurate for this but i may need something similar in the future i sql to determine word count stats of a text

 recently had to update a relatively large control library that uses ninject to ninject to help resolve some issues i had with the update has gone well and i think ninject is a lot to try and avoid this problem in the future i have created my own interface for injecting fields and properties will essentially call methods on the ioc container i wish to use within the current web so now my control library is independant of any particular ioc container which will speed up any changes in that area in the was wondering has anyone else has done the same happy with what it has achieved but ideally i would like to update in my controls i create these injected fields often as protected and set them in the constructor for that problem i have with the above is that i have to use on all objects to actually set the property and i cannot use that on properties would prefer to do something along these lines but i think it is anyone got any ideas of how to neaten the code up or make it work in a cleaner i also would want to avoid attributes so it forces the developer to make a decision to inject the variable at a certain point within the thoughts and feelings are of control for your inversion of control

 recursive from postgresql	
 recursive function is like a spring you compress a bit on each on each you put a bit of information on a when the final step is the spring is collecting all values at sure this metaphor is beyond the classical examples which is the worst example since it is inefficient and easily which are a bit artificial if use them in real programming it is interesting to see where it is really very common case is to walk a tree a but trees are more in a folder to list the you iterate on if you find a the function listing the files call itself with the new folder as when coming back from listing this new folder its it resumes its to the next file concrete case is when drawing a hierarchy of gui it is common to have like to hold components which can be panes or compound the painting routine calls recursively the paint function of each which calls the paint function of all the components it sure if i am very but i like to show real world use of teaching as it was something i was stumbling upon in the

 require too much decoration of but having to put surrogate keys in my domain objects makes me feel a bit call me prefer but my domain objects should surely work with natural keys and not have to resort to mind using surrogates in my but i really want to tamper with my working domain how do i circumvent this i subclass the domain classes with composite adapting them so that nh can use a surrogate key but my domain is seeing only the private parentclass1 these two form a composite private parentclass2 private int public int get return nhdomainclass private long private domainclass public int get return this nh sees nhdomainclass and can use the surrogate because it adapts it can still be used as a viable domainclass in fairly sure this will just want to make sure that not missing some obvious simpler method which would achieve the same thing in a fraction of the without any intrusive class

 respect to your needing to reference the business layer from the i would agree that this is probably not optimal lower tiers should not know about the ones above it reduces reusability and adds circular you considered having your business entities themselves and do their own persistence operations using the dal rather than the dal acting like a factory for them in your current that your dal would be a more direct representation of the and the business entities would contain the logic needed to fill and persist themselves the layer you spec out really appear to me to contain business it looks to me to be more of a persistence services layer for the a variation of what you propose could referencing business contains interfaces and classes with business references dataservices contains classes that find and persist can serve up structures containing the data transfer that can be consumed and processed by business references which simply provides classes that map to on your i would consider merging your businessentities and dataservices in your original into a single the only reason i can think of to split them apart is if you are doing something like silverlight where you need asynchronous data operations on business course all of this is with an incomplete knowledge of your specific system requirements you will need to design what is best for your specific good

 say what kind of data it is much depends on your and this data is very large many instances of the objects in a database can help performance via its indexing otherwise it probably hurts or is your app is being run by multiple users and they may want to write this a database helps because you can rely on transactions to ensure data with persistence you have to handle that if the data is or a database is very likely your app has its own using a database places an additional burden on the who must set up and maintain patches the database if the database can be guaranteed to be available and is handled by someone this is less of an are the security requirements for the if the data is with multiple users simultaneous or you may need to manage security and permissions on the without seeing the data hard to say whether it would be easier to manage with persistence or a the data is many of the above questions about the data have answers pointing toward if you need centralized the answers generally point toward a guess is that you probably need a based solely on the fact that asking about it mainly from a perspective and not a especially in is highly customizable and can be easily tailored to persist only the essential pieces you there are best for versioning this data as so not sure an advantage on the database side from that if you do not know that functionality will be required in the do not build for it almost certainly easier overall to solve that problem when the time comes than to constrain your development more often than sharing data between parts of the that should be architected into the application into the classes that access the overload the persistence mechanism to also be a data conduit between parts of the if you overload it that turning the persisted state into a contract instead of properly treating it as an extension of the private state of the

 say you come from a cocoa background so assuming not talking about most webframeworks that say they do mvc are actually using a different pattern called front a bit of a different story from normal mvc because you need quite a lot of plumbing to make that hence all the mvc frameworks in the originally mvc was a pattern for for these applications you can make mvc work without needing a is a pattern that can be implemented in any object oriented no reason why you do it in the only reason i can think of why people would call mvc on java a approach is that the ui libraries on java like swing do not actually require you to do they just give you the tools to implement a have to create controller and model classes about what is are usually not really constructive mvc is a pattern developed for smaltalk about 30 years none of the implementations that are used now are exactly the same many implementations are got different flavours called and they are all usefull in some the important thing to take away from this is that its a good idea to separate your ui logic from your application java can do this and so can most other people claiming otherwise are probably just afraid to look outside the language comfortable

 second option really as making the sleep time progressively longer means that you will unnecessarily keep those threads you should have a pooled set of threads like the second but they use waithandles to wait for work and use a when the producer indicates that there is it sends a signal to a consumer will be a manager which will determine which thread will get the and then signal that which will wake up and start might want to look into the parallel task in beta but if you can use it and are comfortable with i would recommend as it will manage a great deal of this for you much taking into account the number of cores on a the optimal number of	
 second statement winds up being more or less equivalent to the but only because generics are erased at get an which is why i like better way is to have a static generic method like static return new then test is what google collections you should almost always be declaring your lists as not as makes it easy to switch the implementation dribeas asked in the comments what the exact difference is between the two and why i said they are or less because of the only difference between them is the a small piece of code comparing genericdeclarationtest public static void list1 new string s1 list2 new string s2 the generated bytecode printed by from genericdeclarationtest extends invokespecial static void new invokespecial ldc invokeinterface invokeinterface checkcast new invokespecial ldc invokeinterface invokeinterface checkcast astore you can see you have the the two are this may become easier in java there is a in for type inference for generic instance if it makes the final the syntax will test new test2 new too hard to is

 seem to have two forms of equivalence to deal plain equivalence tracked as equivalence classes which are kept up to date and structural equivalence for which you occasionally go build a single equivalence class and then throw it sounds to me like the problem would be conceptually simpler if you maintain equivalence classes for both plain and structural if that introduces too much churn for the structural you could maintain equivalence classes for some aspects of structural then you could find a balance where you can afford the maintenance of those equivalence classes but still greatly reduce the number of nodes to examine when building a list of structurally equivalent

 seems like a rather difficult thing to because you really isolate a single process to run by in if you tried to do so run into difficulty defining what constitutes a is it just the userspace code that belongs to that or do you include the kernel code executed on behalf of the program as what if the os optimizes kernel code so that similar requests from different programs are handled using a nearly constant amount of then you even separate out the energy usage by a case like my inclination would be to measure the expectation essentially the average amount of energy used by the ideally start with a large number of all identical except that half of them have the application running and half of them let each of the systems run under whatever operating conditions you want to test under conditions for all of except for the fact that half of them are running the app and half are and either measure the rate of energy consumption using the standard or let the batteries run out and measure how long it takes each unit to drain its then compare the average result from the devices that were running the app the average result from those that and you can figure out how much the program increases the power consumption of the

 should know when each customer arrived in the when they arrive at the server you should add one to the number of customers served as well as accumulate the amount of time he at the end of the simulation you simply divide the accumulated time by the number of customers and you have a mean wait time for the core problem is in accounting for different events and updating statistics based on those simulation should initialize all of the structures of your simulation into a reasonable the queue of customers to no one in any count of served customers to any accumulated wait times to the current system time to all the system has been initailized you create an event that a cusotmer this will normally be determined by some given generating system events will need to update the statistics of the you have a choice at this point of generating all of the arrival the service time of each customer is also something that you will generate from a given must then handle each event and update the statistics for example when the first customer arrives the queue has been empty from the time the simulation started to the current the average number of customers in the queue is likely a parameter of you should accumulate the 0 elapsed seconds into an once the customer arrives at the empty queue you should generate the service either the next customer will arrive before or after the given job if the next cusomter arrives before the previous one has been serviced then you add him into the queue the fact no one has been depending on what event occurs next you must accumulate the statistics that occur in that time the idle time of the server is also a parameter of interest in such make things more clear consider the fact there are 18 people in line and the server has completed a job for the first the interval of between the arrival of the 18th customer and the time the first persons job is complete is a weighted average to be added to an there have been 18 people in line for 4 seconds for server has not been idle so you should take an entry off the queue and start processing the next the job will take some amount of time usually defined from some if the next customer arrives before the current job is finished the fact 17 people were in line would be added to your weighted at the fundamental level you are accumulating statistics between relevant events in your wait that helps it seems a bit

 similar things would apply for other there are of things to is great for functional programming works well concurrently partly due to the emphasis on locks when you access mutable shared both for reads and try to go unless you really have locks are but rarely the should almost be part of a condition waiting for a condition to become true and waiting again if to avoid holding locks for longer than you need you ever need to acquire two locks at document the ordering thoroughly and make sure you always use the same the of your most types need to be they just need to not be thread hostile can use them from multiple but responsible for taking out locks if you want to share access the ui in documented from a in windows use off the top of my head i probably think of more if this is useful to but stop there in case

 simply a matter of doing the given a certain amount of traffic for a set of you can calculate exactly how much hosting those file on s3 would cost and you should be able to do the same for your current if the number is lower for there you have your added benefit is that s3 scales pretty much linearly with traffic and you pay only for what you actually whereas most providers charge you a flat fee no matter how little traffic you actially and some will gouge you badly if you ever exceed the maximum traffic included in the flat speed and availability could be an additional if you have a site that could potentially incur wildly disparate then using s3 for its images and other static files means that if hit by the slashdot the site has a much better chance of staying and you have a much better chance of avoiding nasty surprises concerning excess traffic

 small caveat up i have no idea about using or i think your milestones be set by the version control bug tracking milestones are just significant events in your they should be significant to all stake the completion of a major deliverable is a the completion of a few features sign off on all plans and contracts is a significant but the completion of 10 mockups tend to use the schedule and tasks for working with the tick tasks off as they are to everyone else i just report on are we going to make uat by may yes we milestones are tools for reporting to sponsors and other stakeholders you should set them to be what they think is my sponsors will want to know when a certain core set of features is so that is a want to know when uat is signed off so that is a too few milestones and no one will know how you are progressing until the set too many and the value will be is no magic but projects with hundreds of tasks and thousands of man hours may only have 4 a rough diagram of a schedule and this relate to trac and svn but hopefully this gives you a rough idea on how milestones are generally oh and apologies in advance for the overuse of comic

 so a array is just a grouping of useful if got a lot of and you like to save time and the same as now the computer knows what talking about and you can write something to n a two dimensional array is somewhat more but can be thought of as an array of so we could have something like of of of equivalent declaration in pascal to the above a array is a so for if arraya contains the grades of a student in 50 then arrayb represents the grades of a bunch of would be the grade of the third student on class number easy to expand the same logic to add another dimension to the of could say that c represents a so is the grade of the second schools fourth student in class what are arrays used storing groups of similar or information need to be processed in in mostly be using a at most dimensional if you can imagine your data as a almost definitely want an for how else would you represent a chess if you had arrays tend to be used but what if you had to save some sort of state for each of your table something of the third value is 1 if some condition is true for a given and 0 of a trivial but another way of understand arrays more

 so learned wpf and wcf and that was i bother with cardspace because probably not gonna take i bother with it worth the big i bother learning windows	
 so maybe it is insane to disable the power but we have a software application the uses a database and uses an expensive set of this large german vendor uses a license manager that moves the licenses physically around the certain and cutting the power corrupts the we have a ups to allow elegant shutdowns if the machine power is now it seems some service guy or operator has powered down the pc with the power button corrupting the these devices are located in remote location all over the world and training the operator may not always prevent it seems like the solution options are work with the vendor to disable the power attempt to trap it and warn the user of possible or redesign the display using an os and application immune from this power	
 so the short answer is the longer answer is you kind with a bit of hosting this outside of iis actually reasonable to load the configuration section itself and parse as you can cast it to the wcf configuration servicemodelgroup as messy but it does the problem comes with iis iis hosted services inherit their address from iis and will ignore fully qualified addresses in any configuration you can you could use a custom service host this does mean changing your service startup in either code or the file for a custom service host factory deriveds from and overrides override servicehost you can see getting one or more uri objects containing the addresses of your at this point you can store them somewhere lookup table against the service type and then query that in your file you need to change it just a for

 solved this one using much to my dismay when i discovered that python can do this in one simple goal is to create an adding machine using arrays of int ended up using an array of values to simulate an adding but i represented the number which you can do because the problem only asks for the sum of the this means order is essentially doing doubling the value 1000 so can double the value 1 stored in 1st element of the and continue looping until your value over this is where you will to keep track of a carry first power of 2 that is over 10 so the elements in the array the 5th iteration are 6 and when you loop through the starting at the 1st value becomes 12 you keep the and set a carry bit on the index of the which value is doubled you get 2 plus the 1 for the carry bit equals now you have 2 and 3 in array which represents this process 1000 times have an array with roughly elements that you can easily add

 some a duplicate way of performing certain tasks is available because they further abstracted it in a subsequent think about the webclient class which i believe was introduced in it basically wraps a lot of the common tasks you used to have to do with several different classes the old classes are obviously still there if you need to do things a little and for backward but if all you need to do is download a resource from the web as a got usually using because not splitting hairs over cpu so the solution with the least amount of code is the preferred method if not concerned with if programming a server task where no user is going to be on a process and you need to open one file and read it into a go with the static method that lets you do the whole thing in one

 some ideas from concurrency solutions to manage the flood of events coming from the when you first get a resize set a flag to true indicating that the user is currently set a timeout to call the actual resize event handler after 1 whenever this flag is ignore the resize in the actual once everything is done and set the flag back to way you only process the latest event once every second some other period of time depending on your if the user pauses in the middle of it will if the user it will might not be suitable for but there are many other ways of using locks that might be more	
 some internal about instead doing some kind encryption passwords first thing we need to address is data in transit data at from the op it sounds like the big concern is in the clear over the you really care about data in https via ssl is a tested method of doing this a pretty easy if you really want to roll your own for data at rest a on a file a different but the existing methods for data encryption are going to be better than a roll your on the client side for your security is in a corporate you can somewhat rely on a standard users are dumb and you may run into someone disabling javascript or whatever client based solution you roll so they end up sending the in plain text anyway if your servers know what to do with it because not in the expected is not going to be subject to the scrutiny that an existing solution you could end up adding additional security issues into the mix because of the

 someone can comment on hashing it helps if they have at least a fundamental understanding of the underlying concepts and all of the responses so far which have focused on endless typecasting are completely but even will result in unreliable results if a unicode string is being first thing you need to understand is that hashing and encryption algorithms operate at the that means they care what hashing or you can hash plain full etc the algorithm working with the only thing you have to ensure is that the internal function of your hashing library returns an ansistring in the function which spits out your resulting all that actual code for your project can be based on normal string which maps to unicodestring in delphi you be typecasting anything to ansistring or by doing you immediately create a broken hash if and when the user tries to hash anything outside the scope of the ansi character and in the world of a broken hash is both unreliable and

 tag in the software context typically means a meaningful name or attribute being assigned to that in version control scenarios a tag is a meaningful name given to a particular state of the files represented by that for example the tag 20090401 might be assigned to the source code as it looked on april tagging something can also mean describing it or categorizing for example software such as or firefox might all be tagged to categorize them on a download allowing users to create tags and use existing tags is a powerful method to categorize content and help people zero in on items of a tag is simply an extra tidbit of information a person can gain insight into data tagging is useful for many reasons in software for example in my git repository i have a habit of creating tags based on date which can easily be ordered and parsed by a i can also give changes a more human consumable name such as the tag or or this allows for an understanding while also allowing for machine

 terms of memory these two classes are virtually several other responders have suggested that there is a difference between the two in that one is allocating storage on the stack and other on the but not necessarily and even in the cases where it is terribly in all different is where the for the is the actual underlying storage in the is allocated from the heap a little bit tricky to see this because using so the specific implementation details are but is implemented like vector if int int t you can the class itself only has a few members size and a pointer to a dynamically allocated block of memory that will store the actual contents of the your the only difference is where the storage for those few fields comes in the first the storage is allocated from whatever storage you use for your containing class if it is heap so too will be those few bits of the if your container is stack so too will be those few bits of the the second those bits of the are always heap both the actual of the the contents of it are allocated from the and you cannot change else has pointed out already that you have a memory leak in your second and that is also make sure to delete the vector in the destructor of your container

 the actual reason for using instead of a specific delegate is that treats separately declared delegates as totally different though and both have identical argument and return they are not so if every library declared its own delegate type for each delegate those libraries would not be able to interoperate unless the user inserts delegates to perform declare two delegate completely identical but different public delegate void public delegate void a method that is compatible with either of public static void static void can assign any method having the right exceptionhandler1 x1 and yet cannot assign a delegate with identical exceptionhandler2 x2 error at compile encouraging everyone to use microsoft is hoping that this will alleviate the problem of incompatible delegate delegates will play nicely because they will just be matched up based on their solve all because have or but those are less commonly in the comments svish switching a parameter type func to predicate seem to make at least it still without any as long as your program only assigns methods to as in the first line of my the compiler silently generates code to new a delegate object that forwards on to the so in my i could change to be of type without causing a on the second line i try to assign the first delegate to another even thought that 2nd delegate type has exactly the same parameter and return the compiler gives error cannot implicitly convert type to this will make it static bool return x void p f p not method is a perfectly good thing to assign to the and as long as i do so but then i assign one of those variables to the

 the definitive i wrote about the differences between maven and ant in the introduction the section title is differences between ant and an answer that is a combination of the info in that introduction with some additional simple only showing you this to illustrate the idea at the most basic maven has a simple ant build simple example build set global properties for this build create the time stamp create the build directory structure used by compile the source compile the java code from into the create the distribution directory put everything in into the delete the and directory trees this simple ant you can see how you have to tell ant exactly what to there is a compile goal which includes the javac task that compiles the source in the directory to the you have to tell ant exactly where your source where you want the resulting bytecode to be and how to package this all into a jar while there are some recent developments that help make ant less a experience with ant is in coding a procedural language written in the previous ant example with a maven in to create a jar file from some java all you need to do is create a simple place your source code in and then run mvn install from the command the example maven that achieves the same all you need in your running mvn install from the command line will process compile execute unit create a and install the jar in a local repository for reuse in other without you can run mvn site and then find an file in that contains links to javadoc and a few reports about your source this is the simplest possible example a project which only contains source code and which produces a a project which follows maven conventions and require any dependencies or if we wanted to start customizing the our is going to grow in and in the largest of projects you can see collections of very complex maven poms which contain a great deal of plugin customization and dependency even when your pom files become more they hold an entirely different kind of information from the build file of a similarly sized project using maven poms contain is a jar and source code is in ant build files contain explicit is source is in javac against this the results in a jar from the where ant had to be explicit about the there was something to maven that just knew where the source code was and how it should be differences between ant and maven in this have formal conventions like a common project directory you have to tell ant exactly where to find the source and where to put the informal conventions have emerged over but they been codified into the is you have to tell ant exactly what to do and when to do you had to tell it to then then have a you had to define goals and goal you had to attach a sequence of tasks to each goal has it already knew where your source code was because you followed the it put the bytecode in and it produced a jar file in is all you had to do was create a file and put your source in the default maven took care of the has a which you invoked when you executed mvn this command told maven to execute a series of sequence steps until it reached the as a of this journey through the maven executed a number of default plugin goals which did things like compile and create a about so someone like steve loughran is going to read that comparison and call going to talk about how the answer completely ignores something called ivy and the fact that ant can reuse build logic in the more recent releases of this is if you have a bunch of smart people using ant antlibs end up with a well designed build that even very much convinced that maven makes happily use ant ivy with a project team that had a very sharp build that being i do think end up missing out on a number of valuable plugins such as the jetty plugin and that end up doing a whole bunch of work that you need to do over important than maven that you use a repository manager to keep track of software suggest you can use nexus to proxy remote repositories and to provide a place for your team to deploy internal have appropriate modularization of software one big monolithic component rarely scales over as your project want to have the concept of modules and maven lends itself to this approach very adopt some conventions for your even if you use you should strive to adopt some form of convention that is consistent with other when a project uses it means that anyone familiar with maven can pick up the build and start running with it without having to fiddle with configuration just to figure out how to get the thing to

 the gcc toolchain to give you an image suitable for use directly on the hardware without an os to load it is but involves a couple of steps that normally needed for normal will almost certainly need to customize the c run time startup this is an assembly module named something like that is responsible initializing the initialized clearing the calling constructors for global objects if modules with global objects are typical customizations include the need to setup your hardware to actually address the ram including setting up the dram controller as so that there is a place to put data and some cpus need to have these things done in a specific the coldfire mcf5307 has one chip select that responds to every address after boot which eventually must be configured to cover just the area of the memory map planned for the attached hardware team you with another hat should have a memory map documenting what is at various rom at ram at device registers at in some the hardware team might only have connected a chip select from the cpu to a and leave it up to you to decide what address triggers that select ld supports a very flexible linker script language that allows the various sections of the executable image to be placed in specific address for normal you never see the linker script since a stock one is supplied by gcc that is tuned to your assumptions for a normal output of the linker is in a relocatable format that is intended to be loaded into ram by an it probably has relocation fixups that need to be and may even dynamically load some in a rom dynamic loading is not so you be doing but you still need a raw binary image in a hex format suitable for a prom programmer of some so you will need to use the objcopy utility from binutil to transform the linker output to a suitable to answer the actual question you use a linker script to specify the target addresses of each section of your in that you have several options for dealing with device but all of them involve putting the bss and heap segments in address ranges that avoid the hardware there are also mechanisms available that can make sure that ld throws an error if you overfill your rom or and you should use those as getting the device addresses into your c code can be done with as in your or by declaring a symbol directly in the linker script that is resolved to the base address of the with a matching declaration in a c header it is possible to use attribute to define an instance of an uninitialized as being located in a specific section as i have found that not to work well in real it can create maintenance and it becomes an expensive way to describe the full register map of the if you use that the linker script would then be responsible for mapping to its correct any you are going to need to get a good understanding of object file concepts such as the and bss sections at and may need to chase down details that bridge the gap between hardware and software such as the interrupt vector interrupt supervisor user modes rings 0 to 3 on x86 and the

 the other the biggest savings comes from eliminating all unnecessary state you look at they will start discarding state as soon as things are and oftentimes retain because their resources are too tight to keep around more than the minimum number of it on the for a game like fallout 3 is just a matter of increasing the scope of the you start sectioning up the landscape by grid or other geometrical and stuff as the player moves from one section to the you ideally keep the size of each area small so that state is not you figure out the bare minimum of state needed to keep around npc and item and in the layout data you tag as much as possible to so that it need any state you want to be pointed at a specific data an example serialization format might be a linear stream indexed by a tree of where the organization of the tree corresponds to the map	
 the overloaded operator which evaluates the stream in boolean this checks the state of the stream to see if the previous operation had failed if you cannot rely on the value in the integer variable being valid because the input on the stream was not an variables and are defined in the scope of the while loop they are not available outside the you can declare them outside the scope of the while in which case the variable will hold the last value it held in the while	
 the ownedgroups property of the spuser class to return the collection of groups owned by a misunderstood the the currently logged in that use to a third times the so you want to find out what group the user is in based on the roles they a bit of a combination of the above two attempts at answering matched from r in where select note that the roles property work in the next version of i think would be an easier way to figure out what groups the user is but it ignores your role

 the primary key both does not ensure the names are it just ensures that each is and obviously is already being an so you could still for and as the pairs are only reason to make them both the primary key is if you will be frequently executing queries where both countryid and name are used in the where the primary key creates a clustered which physically sorts the so it makes lookups for rows against those predicates very important point to raise is that in your particular you are storing a list of countries which is very short and change lookups against this table are going to be fast no matter what you even if sql server has to do a full table scan every you probably even you have to worry about page you could just skip the id column and use the as a primary if you want to keep an id but also enforce uniqueness of just the country you can a unique on the name is difficult to cover the issue of primary clustered and indexes in in too much depth in a single here are a few good resources to get should primary keys be introduction to clustered and index data

 the question of cluttering the code when demonstrating a coding i think the question do you choose to handle the error in your example is to what do you do fatal for one application is for if i retrieve some info from a webserver it a 404 error or a that may be fatal if you do anything without that but if that data is supplementary to what then perhaps you can live without the above may point to simply logging the better than ignoring the error but i think often the difficulty is in knowing when to recover from an perhaps a whole new tutorial in

 the right that depends entirely on the if you need to plug your code into another framework or whatever you probably have to use whatever language that framework is made making your own probably there are several reasons why suggest you go with another well suited for if your goal is to learn programming through these go with a language that is more amenable to by is full of pitfalls and things that to until one day they add to this a horribly complex syntax and some pretty complex idioms and techniques you have to master to work around quirks of the language that simply are in pretty much any other and you have a good source of bugs and and not much has no concept of come with any kind of support for processing or playing loading or saving audio files or anything most modern languages have some form of audio support built into the standard language least the ability to load and play mp3 files and other such in all of this will have to be done through libraries and you have a real choice in say go for something like python or easier to come with a lot more functionality out of the and make it a lot harder to shoot yourself in the i recommend to someone who already an experienced

 the single data once you start encountering performance problems there are many solutions like you can partition your tables by website id also known as horizontal partitioning or you can also use this all depends upon the the ratio of reads vs for start keep things simple and use one table with proper you can also determine if you need transactions or you can also take advantage of various different mysql storage engines like myisam or ndb memory to boost up the also caching plays a very good role in offloading the load from the the data that is mostly read only and can be computed easily is usually put in the cache and the cache serves the request instead of going to the database and only the necessary queries go to the

 the source code for red products is available in opensource but the sold version is what is called the productized does productized mean it means as michael it has additional it has the certified it has matching it also means that some features in the community version are removed or have a slightly different configuration default and slightly different of jboss eap comes bundled with jboss as does productized seam works on jboss as seam from did eap has a profile which is tuned for production hotdeploy disabled and other best practices which our support jboss as does not have eap gets supported and guaranteed cumulative patches for many jboss as from does of the above is about having a productized version that is supportable for a long period of time and hence much more about having a stable version than about having the cutting edge version of the latest you are looking for the bleeding edge then is for answer you question for i download the code from sure to be using the same stuff that someone who buys it from red then the answer to that it depends on the projects are the where as others have more visible differences but all features in the productized version is available in the but there might be some features that exist in that has been what to if you are looking for bleeding use if you are looking for making sure you are developing on the same set of binaries which hat can provide development and product support on for the next many then the product from red hat you refer to assume you meant jboss developer studio is your best the official answer to what the difference is between the community and enterprise versions is shown at full the lead of jboss tools and jboss developer

 the specific requirement to provide a library of objects shipped with the application a database system is probably not the right thing that springs to mind is that you probably want the file to be updatable you need to be able to drop and updated file into the application without changing the rest of the thing is that the data shipping is immutable for this purpose therefore you need the capabilities of a relational just to be able to access a particular model with adequate simplicity an xml file would do nicely as got good using that as a basis you can then choose to compress encrypt embed it as a resource in an assembly one were playing in if sqlite stores its data in a single file and if you have other reasons to need the capabilities of a db in you storage system then but want to think about the utility of the db to the app as a whole

 the strings will not use twice the since strings are immutable objects in you will just store another reference 4 or 8 per entry in the dict new mywidget will always be reusing the string object from the so just go on with the dict and store the path as property inside the you need to enumerate the widgets in sorted use the it will be slower than the dictionary log average the path will need you to remove it from the dictionary and add it with the changed but this is an average constant time so it should be pretty just to mention even if you would have to spend one mb of additional memory for getting more performance or using a data i think that would be a great problem considering the amount of memory other applicatins are using these days

 their anyway to test the correctness of a powershell script without executing i know you could do something similar in but find the equiv for what i have is a script where each script is tied to if a rule the script but i need to be sure the script is before its put in the unfortunately the command is not its the syntax of scripts i want to check from a runtime which fires a script if a engine rule before the script i write into ilist values from the and then i fire but i need to ensure it is syntactically otherwise going to have to rely on the rule writer to ensure they are which i as many people will wrote only one duff script will bring the engine i do that as the engine is an enterpise class product designed for six sigma think the way to do it is to use which is a v2 think there is way of creating a scriptblock and putting a try catch around it to catch the can somebody tell me how to do this is becoming a real i spoke to a guy in ms sharepoint and he spoke to one of the powershell and he informed me that there is no real way in powershell v1 to check the syntax of the script without so i guess the flag is the but it not a static checker good news in v2 there is a way to tokenize the input via the tokenize this will tokenize a script in accordance with the ps so if it craps its a crap question is v2 have an release date as for powershell scripts for

 there a reason that you want to avoid using the data binding it handles keeping parity between the value and the property value and provides rich can interface with the data binding engine in two either programatically or through the to do basic data binding programatically is say i have a class named with a string property named i have a textbox named mytxtbox on a form with an instance of fooclass called foo and i want to bind it to the mystring this will cause updates to the textbox to get assigned to the and changes to the property from elsewhere will be reflected in the more complex data binding probably want to create an object data source in your project and put a bindingsource on your if you need help with specific steps in creating the data source i can but in general create the source in your project and select the class to which you want to you can then place a bindingsource on your point it at your object project data then use the visual studio designer to bind properties for your controls to properties on your you then set the datasource property in your code to an instance of the class or collection to which you want to a side as far as i am aware there is no as properties are actually function pairs and a i read your like to point out that data even at the control does not automatically use data binding is built around type descriptors and property both for the bound control and the data true that if one or both of these sides does not implement specific property and type description then reflection will be but either side is more than free to provide its own description profile which would not use

 there a way to use the method to compile the expression associated with an currently i have an iqueryable with a very large expression tree behind the iqueryable was built up using several methods which each supply for two methods may return iqueryables which are then joined in a for this reason i explicitly define the entire expression within the method was hoping to pass the expression in to the compile method as however this expression in the form required by the compile if i try and get around this by putting the query directly into the compile var foo var bar i make the call form within a i get an error saying that is not mapped as a stored procedure or again i just copy the contents of the getusers method to where i make the compile call since it in turn makes use of other there some way to pass the expression on the iqueryable returned from into the compile tried to force my will on the system with the following var phony wishful var foo ends up have the option to see the results in as instead of offering to expand the results and run the query i only see the message could destabilize the just need to find a way for the sql string to only be generated once and used as a paramaterized command on subsequent i can do this manually using the getcommand method on the data but then i have to explicitly set all the parameters and do the object mapping which is a few hundred lines of code given the complexity of this particular rusk provided the most useful so i awarded him the win on this some extra tweaking was required and there were a couple of other issues i encountered along the way so i thought on the the could destabalize the error was not due to the compilation of the it was actually because of some casting deep in the expression in some places i needed to call the method to formally cast even when they were of the correct without going into too much detail this was basically required when several expression were combined into a single tree and each branch could return a different which were each the sub type of a common solving the destabalizing i returned to the compilation expand solution was almost it looked for method call expressions in the tree and tried to resolve them to the underlying expression that method would usually my references to expressions were not provided by method but instead so i needed to modify the expression visitor that performs the expansion to include these override expression return new return method may not be appropriate in all but it should help anyone who finds themselves in the same linq to sql queries from a

 these actually three different concepts or am i getting been reading articles about threading and garbage collection together and have confused i think this may just be the term for sections of code that you want multiple threads accessing at the same time inside lock and no real clue here msdn says something along the lines of tells a host that exceptions thrown within the section might have wider and that of the clr sql may choose to handle exceptions thrown within critical regions differently and most in what real world scenarios might i need to mark code as a critical execution i came across this when reading about the criticalfinalizerobject in a garbage collection all i can understand from msdn on this one is that code within one of these regions is somehow guaranteed to run and must therefore not throw what is an did google this but it just asked me if i meant of bounds is it any unhandled or only certain types of and most in what real world scenarios might i need a execution i understand the concepts at all not sure what tags this question needs other than between and execution

 thing noticed using mercurial is that changed the way i even locally on my the idea that every copy is a repo lends itself to keeping different copies with different work and merging them together or into the nice because patch sets for different things stay as well as keeping the work itself these things can be done in some manner in traditional but in mercurial offering more flexibility in organizing workflow has other nice payoffs as	
 thing of that i like about mvc is that it gets rid of web server while they are seen by many as a great thing about i have found that once you get past the basic operations they become a trying to juggle databinding events on grids with postbacks and everything else becomes the oo version of spaghetti will require you have a better knowledge of the basic tenants of web development the result will be much see my graph of how i think mvc works

 thing to keep in mind is that on the you can compile for multiple and produce a known as a it may be better to simply compile with both i386 which will allow the user to choose at runtime which one to run can also include ppc if you want to support older ppc that if the user ends up moving their filesystem from one machine to they will still have appropriate binaries for the given see the transition for more	
 thing to keep in mind when working with nhibernate is that it deals with entities and only knows what told it the mapping hql is an version of sql so you use it to access fields that part of your mapped domain can still execute plain old sql through an nhibernate session which is really the only way to access data that you mapped into your there might be a lightweight mapping solution i say without seeing your data but if against mapping the i think sql is your best	
 thing to note is that this have a lot to do with but is rather a pure html possible solution is to use the css attribute fixed and set some fixed width values to all the disadvantage of this approach is that the total table width is fixed so it scale with the window possible approach is to display in columns shorter strings using a utility function that cuts the long strings to a maximum

 think a good starting point is to systemise the bug fix if going at assuming your code base is and these bugs are difficult to start with some how long to understand the how long to which code is being fixed there a pattern when you do you add another unit do you review individual and team where bugs are couple of weeks doing that will give you a really good basis for future it will also be a professional approach that your manager should buy	
 think a really cool use of javascript that used nearly often enough is for data with you can write one javascript file to validate a check it on the client then check it again on the server side because we trust anything on the client it lets you keep your validation rules quite javascript take which implementation is most and how do you use server side

 think going about this the wrong your plan be to update all current code to java your plan should be to ensure that all current code runs exactly the same in as it did in and that all future code written will work fine in gone through a few transitions like this of varied sized code the goal was always to make sure we had a ton of unit tests so that we could easily plug in and run our tests through we actually encountered about 10 mostly related to regular expression libraries not supporting something or supporting something all new code in and if you change an older class for whatever spend a minute and implement but no reason to refactor that sounds a bit dangerous to me if you have the tests in	
 think got the most important bits you more metadata i know the details of what is emitted by a c or but i suspect more names and similar information are included in just look at what the decompiler knows about in a particular stack for example as far as the x86 is you only know how the stack is in il you know what the contents of the stack at the type not the semantic as already il is a higher level abstraction than x86 has no idea what a method or function call or an or a property il has all that information still within c and compilers optimise much more heavily than the this is because the compiler assumes that most of the optimisation can still be performed later by the in some ways it makes sense for the compiler to try to do much as there are various bits of information which are available to the jit but not the optimised code is harder to because further away from being a natural representation of the original source was designed to be x86 was designed to be executed natively via the information the jit compiler needs is similar to that that a decompiler would so a decompiler has an easier time with in some ways this is really just a restatement of the second

 think i can agree with that as a are definitely cases where a relative link makes more with a directory tree of a for if the project is or moved into another absolute links could be confusing if you are talking about there will be cases where relative links make and other times compare having a link to a very generic like grep versus something like multiple versions and target flavors of the gnu compiler tools living on the same in the latter absolute links to the specific tool versions will probably all comes back to what you really want to do in each the general answer is that there is no generalized

 think i should clarify how the compilation model first of you can write everything in a single file and inherit from whatever class you want to ultimately inherits from by specifying attribute you might want to omit and without a if you do you can still access the properties from the file that uses this the thing you use the class in the codebehind file of page it has by specifying the if you are using the website project model of visual you can access it from the file note that this would not work in web application project model as every file will be compiled ahead of the time to the in that even attribute help any strictly none of the attributes are you can always use the properties defined anywhere in or file included in a page in the file always to address the update to the from your source it seems you are using the website model note that i mentioned you cannot use the i agree this statement might have been a little what i wanted to note is that without a will choose a name for your user control class but that name is not while you use the generated not recommended at you should treat it pretty much like an anonymous type where you can use an instance but cannot mention a in your you are basically referencing an instance is constructed on the not the which is what you are saying is whatever you declare in in a web application will be visible to and what i was talking about is properties that you declare in in a those will not be visible to since compiled will generate the class defined by the attribute in the you should use there is one thing i forgot to in this you should somehow reference the in the either with a directive reference directive or with a directive register this will ensure that the build engine puts the generated class in the same assembly as

 think in your uiimage should handle this app and give good the issue looks to be that you are forcing the whole screen to redraw in response to every the rect that is passed in specifies the that you need to any other drawing is just wasting the rect you pass to your is the rect you specifically want to calculate a rect around the touch and invaliate uikit will union mutiple dirty rects and send a single would suggest you perform the following the dirty rect passed to your the and if it is less than the full screen write code to make sure you only repaint images within the dirty the touches event to make sure you only invalidate the areas that need redrawing and then revisit this get the performance you use quartz to draw the black and white rects rather than using images incase it is some uiimage weirdness i doubt this is the you need to display bitmaps and 1 2 get the performance you you will have to resort to lower level there are lots of examples around including on

 think it makes a real difference for what is contiguous in an array of strings is the references to the the strings themselves are stored at random places in lists can make a difference for primitive not for you know in advance the number of and need an array of millions of integers or doubles will be more efficient in memory and marginally in speed than a because indeed they will be stored contiguously and accessed why java still uses arrays of chars for arrays of ints for image

 think it would have helped you to get answers if abstracted the problem so that it rely on the neodatis db interface that threw me for a as never used what written below about it is based on a very cursory that never used groovy though i like what seen of but seeing as no one else has answered stuck with me think the problem at least part of may be that expecting too much of the simplenativequery class from it look like it even tries to filter the objects before it adds them to the returned i think instead you want to use the in the package this has me a bit as i know for sure if this class is meant to be used by but i see any other classes in neodatis that allow for query criteria to be instead of using criteriaquery i think rather wrap it inside of a groovy class so that you can use it with i think a groovy version of your code with closures might look something like create a class that wraps criteriaquery and allows you to pass this is wordy but at least groovycriteriaquery extends criteriaquery private final i prefer to check for null instead of in if throw new be c public boolean assuming here that can be used as the object instance at least as proxy for may have to extract the actual object from aoi before calling return now use the query class in some random src new hope this

 think that our method can be called best but it has served us have several large databases for our application so maintaining local copies on each developers computer has never really been an and even though we develop against the live we do need to do the development against a database that is as close to the real thing as a consequence we use a central web server as and keep a development branch of our subversion trunk on generally we work on the same part of the system at but when we do need to do or someone is making a lot of substantial we branch the trunk and create a new vhost on the dev also have a checkout of the code on the production so after finished testing we simply do a svn update on the production implemented a script that executes the update command on all servers using this is extremely since our code base is large and takes a lot of time to subversion will only copy the files that actually have been so a lot has worked really well for and the only thing to watch out for is making changes on the production servers directly of course is a from the since it might cause conflicts when

 think that there are some things to do before you tackle the technical question what technology do i create the true knowledge and understanding of the system is what lies beyond the actual interface relationships and module it is the understanding of the whole system and how the individual parts in it contribute to the would go in the following try to the system this means to first understand the structure of the modules and create some representation of from the top this you will probably find additional metadata on the modules that does not exist in your current take the time to add it will be most useful when you later create the automatic because it will reflect the knowledge on the system write a simple program that will generate a set of files from the that will help you browse and navigate the information more easily as a starting point for further i would not go into a fully fledged javadoc format in the start small and evolve your in as needs this process you would also discover where refactoring would make use the output of your htmls to research structure of several modules and reach understanding of internal of are there naming repeated anything that you can deduce and is not obviously documented already in the would create some local uml but not of a size that will get out of hand perhaps several umls per mark dependencies to external modules in a distinct generation of automated umls will not be as it is the of meaningful interfaces in each diagram that will make the most enlightening umls in the think the final result of a set of htmls and umls will be a good final

 think the general consensus on the current windows workflow is that the product is not quite ready for primetime if you want to get anything more than trivial accomplished with the current you will likely have to write a few custom tasks to fill in functionality also had issues with the designer flaking out when the complexity of the workflow starts piling what been about windows the next version is a complete rewrite that fixes a lot of the issues in the current they claim backward compatibility with but you probably will have to know the framework pretty well to know what changed and how to fix it if it work right you have a project that absolutely demands this functionality probably better off waiting until the new bits	
 think the main benefit is that it only requires iterations over collections 1 level it can call but at least the method will be	
 think the main difference is authentication means that the identity is handled as part of the windows handashaking and now password is ever for authentication means that you have to store a username and a password yourself making it much easier to a heap of effort has gone into making windows authentication very robust and i suggest that if you do implement windows authentication use groups and roles to do groups in windows and roles in having to setup lots of users in sql is a big pain when you can just setup the group and then add each user to the think most security should be done this way	
 think the of both pattern are showing the an algorithm inside a to image description the exact steps of an algorithm to a to image description	
 think the optimization is root of all has to be understood literally it does not say when is and does not say you should optimize only at the just not too the the right vs is a bit dangerous if taken literally because for many the n is actually think it depends a lot of the type of software you are some software are such as every part is very and can be optimized but not always the for many speed just does not matter at the brute force but obviously correct way is the best but for projects where speed it often has to be taken into account early maybe another possible interpretation of many applications need to be optimized at just know which ones need and plan

 think the problem might be that cannot implicitly cast an int to a it looks like your mapping maps this field to an int16 the you are passing in is allocated as an int by know why it would have trouble comparing an int to a short think there is a literal suffix for you might be able to do	
 think the problem you encounter is due to the way you add the commandbutton in the jsf component to be more the way uou do not add it in the component you do not attach the commandbutton to the jsf component when this component is rendered your call to it does not find the form where this component is the html input is not created you can try to add the commandbutton created to the form before asking it to be you can do that with the following search for the component htmlform that is a parent of the current uicomponent uicomponent parent while instanceof parent return void throws ioexception htmlajaxcommandbutton replycommentbutton new add the command button in the form that contains your custom uicomponent form if that tested this so maybe you have to modify it a it still maybe you will need to review you code in order to create the commandbutton outside the render class or outside the i think it is a good idea to modify the jsf components tree during the rendering

 think the rarely changing settings can safely go to this was its fairly transparent where they come from for new developers on the and still it is possible to change the setting without thing that change often and i would use either settings file in profile or other shared something that would make managing the changes in configuration the other i think that resource file is though to be used for storing it is rather to centralize in some cases keep of all hardcoded stuff in your i would be very surprised if i inherited your	
 think the reason you are seeing this in leaks is because is using the autorelease pool being discarded until the next i think the sample is too simple to accurately show going could be way off base but i would try wrapping your code in an autorelease pool to see what nsautoreleasepool nsmutablestring test this should drain the autorelease	
 think the ruby class libs can do pretty much anything the java libs can so not much of a compelling reason to use jruby on rails in a use it to integrate with a vendor java knocking up a quick controller and some views is much easier than extending using in a a rails developer may be obliged to deploy to tomcat or the warbler gem for jruby enables

 think the trick is the following going to do it in base because but the principle should you are multiplying mod 1234 12 100 5432 54 100 12 54 10000 34 54 100 12 32 100 34 54 10000 648 54 100 1836 32 100 384 32 x 10000 x the first and last terms become the second and third terms are where the come note 18 100 100 18 10000 3600 3618 is essentially a circular giving the results of 648 3618 8403 and also note that in all the multiplied numbers are a 100 and b so this is calculable if you only could multiple 2 digit numbers and add going to work out with a and both are 32 suppose you want to multiply them mod but you only have a 16 bit multiplier 32 the algorithm would be something like a b accumulator for for do the temp add the bits to the shifting over the right x for bits bits accumulator do modulus if it if accumulator so the accumulator part of that probably i think in principle right someone feel free to edit this to make it this is pretty as which is what the prng x x

 think there is anything wrong with using exceptions for exceptions are somewhat similar to continuations and in statically typed exceptions are more powerful than if you need continuations but your language have you can use exceptions to implement if you need continuations and your language have you chose the wrong language and you should rather be using a different but sometimes you have a web programming is prime just no way to get around is a project to allow writing web applications in and let the framework take care of figuring out which bits need to run one consequence of this is that volta needs to be able to compile cil to so that you can run code on the there is a has javascript volta implements continuations in javascript using javascript then implements threads using those that volta applications that use threads can be compiled to run in an unmodified no silverlight	
 think they have a long and acceptable answer for your question on the viemu other even more powerful take the which is composed of and the command deletes the range specified by the next motion and also enters insert the same as but with the distinction that it enters insert instead of staying in normal the boon is that the text you type in the next input session is also part of the so if you do what you do is replace from the cursor to the end of the word by and the command afterwards will work exactly like replace up to the end of the word with have installed year but i have to say without strong linux never used too too too imho a great challenge but no more for the of the

 think this boils down to certain design create a list of requirements or a functional look at all possible ways to solve the decide which ways fits best or leads to the best you describe shows that they make a good analysis of the and in the end it comes down to how well the themselves are able to gather the right information and then make the correct this might involve asking more senior programmers examples of design methods to decide what the best possible options

 think this is bit explanation but still it clarifies using real life say playing an audio involves three getting the compressed song from decompress the play the uncompressed your audio player does step sequentially for every song then it is you will have to wait for some time to hear the song till the song actually gets fetched and your audio player does step independent of each then it is playing audio 1 step if it fetches audio 3 from harddisk in parallel and it decompresses the audio 2 in 2 will end up in hearing the song without waiting much for fetch and

 think this will help you thwart dos if you sleep the request you are still allowing the request to occupy your thread pool and still allow the attacker to bring your web service to its best bet may be to lock out requests after a specified number of failed attempts based on the attempted login source to try and target the source of the attack without detriment to your valid

 think we can know any definitive answer unless we have the compiler developers drop we can guess about the it could optimization perhaps it saves some work for the jit readability makes it easier for human eyes to grasp what a type implements when looking at the msil how the summer intern implemented it and since it works nobody is going to change it just in case it breaks

 think what saying is that for any active the tuple must be in other is if the survey is even though is set up to be the answer is to change your table adding a nullable activeanswerid column to survey will effectively make the relation your existing constraint unique surveyid unique will suffice to enforce unless surprised that survey has a question expect to be survey has many or even if a question can show up on more than one i suspect the reason that figuring out how to enforce the constraint is difficult and requires like triggers or user defined is a symptom of a schema that accurately model your problem missing is is the survey question tuple would be mean that for every at most one looking at your misleading at a surveydomain has many surveys of which has a question and a survey has many if the active bit is there should be only one survey a misnomer for really not clear what trying to if hard to add a that suggests that your model

 think you answered your question writing it down problem can be seen in this from one hand you have time you have fresh data and from them nice to create view to show time as time goes there are more data and logic so good to have written down summaries of data you had some time very pragmatic you do not duplicate because you recalculate them and save into new table summary of when you think of it in this obvious that in this example new table will be as you have more complicated archive data unchanged when logic when you meet this of this criteria as you requirement than its not choice you go into i would use view is only when showing fresh data out of other fresh in very simple and when it gets more complicated you always switch to new do not be afraid to go into having one summary table with faster access is very pretty solution and a sign of well formed care of the design of this table so when business logic changes you do not need to change everything from one stone in this and then everything will be	
 think you are able to do and i suspect that the limitation is part of http using the redirection happens as a header unless otherwise specified in the a look at the http spec itself reveal any way to change the type of request the browser makes via class of status code that further action needs to be by the user agent in order to the the action required be carried out by the user without interaction with the user and only if the method used in second request is get or think you may need to use javascript to achieve this or perhaps rethink the flow of control in your

 think you are asking why you have to use if you are running perl one of the libraries you are calling is getting loaded before libc and it is likely single as part of its dependency it is attempting to load a library in your by using i think you are using the principle of library interposition to force that library to load prior to loading the unsafe the notion of interposition is a complex one and you might gain some benefit from the following use library you to create a special shared library set the when is dynamic linker will use the library before any other when searches for shared	
 think you are going to have to do quite a bit of work for you would have to create an implementation of icustomtypedescriptor which would base its implementation on whatever typedescriptor you would normally get for that in the implementations of the methods which expose the descriptors of the members you want to lock you would provide subclasses which derive from those descriptors and override the appropriate methods to wrap a lock for a you would implement getproperties to return your specific subclasses of these subclasses would override the getvalue and setvalue methods and use a lock when accessing those should be mentioned that locking like this in the ui thread is probably a bad since you want to arbitrarily block operations on that it might be better to just create a clone of the object and then have a method which updates the store of objects when you are

 think you can say that an appropriate number is no or good rule of thumb for constructors is to pass an object its not its those parameters you pass in are ones that are essential for the existence of the and without which most operations of the object may not be you genuinely have a class with a very complicated natural hence requiring many parameters then consider the design of your example of a bad constructor int int the nightwatchman is being constructed with some default values that will almost certainly change in a short it seems funny that the object is told about their values one and then has them in a different way their in example of a better constructor boolean gate the watchman is watching is required information for one to in the class i would mark it chosen to pass the variable into the because here it was important that at all times the object knew whether to shoot identity is being used as could have a class called and the parameter is interpreted as part of the objects

 think you have to define a separate resource for usage with the when you declare an image resource it is basically creating object of type after that you make it a child of the menuitem and the button by setting icon and content therefore it is not a tree this is not you try to declare the second button that also uses get an exception of logical know how menuitem escaped that may be it is smart enough to remove the image element from children is how it before it adds the image to own logical children i just found a simpler you could add to the image declaraiton in the this will ensure that a new instance of that image is created and it would not break wpf tree

 think you should add a wrapperfactory to your and provide the actual factory implementation in the something class public t a t the wrapped item class implements private private public public boolean return basic problem is that erasure let you know anything about t in the actual so unless you pass something to your list that knows about the specific t you are using how to wrap you be able to do and not designing you in a corner simply a common limitation of java

 think your 3 points show that you need to learn i think of any situation where learning a new language is time to learn something you are interested in any new always improves your other programming you learn different approaches to problems that you may be able to implement differently with other with the minimal syntax of it would be a good language to ensure you are getting correct results when you implement a solution in another	
 thinking a little you have to have only one assembly info is how we do it for a each project has 3 assembly info contains and any assembly specific contains assemblyversion and this way all assemblies in a share the same contains and any attributes we want all our assemblies to 2 and 3 are referenced using as this way they are shared from the single source you may not want to adopt the same but you could certainly use a similar structure and place your xmlconfigurator in a separate assembly info file from your assembly version

 this answer assumes the the question is about data if talking about then everything of depends entirely on what you want to do with those they are meant for logging only or are only handled and always in then the only real limit is the limit possibly if you want to be to avoid problems during transport and on different they represent some structured data that needs effectively random then quickly switch to a much more structured such as an embedded database like sqlite or	
 this article alone you can conclude that a semaphore must have a consensus number less than or equal to the third page of the article they operation is quite it can be used for since we know that has consensus number equal to theorem 1 of that paper can then be used to show that a semaphore must have consensus number less than or equal to the proof goes like that a implementation of semaphores by further assume that a semaphore has consensus number greater than we know that has a consensus number of from theorem 1 we can conclude that there exists no implementation of a semaphore by in a system of more than 2 this contradicts the assumption that an implementation by a semaphore must have a consensus number less than or equal to

 this fails the constraint it basically doubles the space i very much doubt that a solution which do that without wrecking the runtime complexity somewhere making note that this change the of the space if got a stack with space this will still be just with a different constant a stack of of all values lower in the when you pop the main pop the min stack when you push the main push either the new element or the current whichever is is then implemented as just using your stack min top popping twice you stack min let me know if this enough simple when you grok but it might take a bit of at first downside of course is that it doubles the space execution time suffer significantly though still the same a variation which is slightly more but has better space in we still have the min but we only pop from it when the value we pop from the main stack is equal to the one on the min we only to the min stack when the value being pushed onto the main stack is less than to the current min this allows duplicate min is still just a peek for taking the original version and pushing 1 stack min top from the above pops from both stacks because 1 stack min top again pops from the main because 5 stack min again pops both stacks because 1 stack min ends up with the same worst case space complexity the original but much better space usage if we rarely get a minimum or an implementation of evil i tested it but i okay class private readonly stack new could pass this in to the private readonly comparer private t public t get return public void if 0 currentmin public t t ret if currentmin return

 this i found it on one of the answers in so type you can also try searching so and googling for types vs value for differences between structs and restricts a struct from acting like a are many you cannot inherit from a for have virtual so you cannot use a struct to implement an instance methods in structs can access private but apart from that they behave a lot like auxilirary functions immutable they sometimes even need to access private so i find them to be not as near as as class

 this is not possible in with a bit of wickedness more clarification on unfortunately a bit i assume should read one should note that this approach will strip whitespaces from the dragonfly that reads characters which can be anything except the newline character the second part of the specifier rejects anything why the character is if the line has more than characters upto but including the newline the newline character tells to stop what if we did as dragonfly the only problem is will not know where to stop and will keep suppressing assignment until the next newline is hit is another match for the first hence you will trail by one line of input when if you wanted to read in a a little modification is we need to add a to consume the unmatched the maxline stringify these work only in so keep both char maxline 1 wickedness we read from to the format specifier is the only tricky we bite off more than we can chew hence the specification of maximum number of chars width has to go into a so we stringify it using the careful reader will observe that once we read maxline characters we discard the rest upto including a int n if while n if return

 to follow on to what kevin there are no jvm implementations that i am aware of that allow you to share static variables across jvm as previous answers have stated each jvm instance is own is a clustering not a allows for arbitrary sharing of object instances across jvm process boundaries including sharing static thus the moniker attached for all intents and when using terracotta technology in your jvm all of the threads in all of the vms behave as if they were all looking at a shared caveats of since not physically terracotta manages it through sophisticated sharing and replication algorithms which involve network io to move data so therefore there are times when latency and throughput will not compare to native memory are abundant examples in the cookbook section of the terracotta site i recommend you start with the hello instance to get a feel for how it	
 to garner the exit statuses of the child processes in using makes no guarantee about the sequence in which the child corpses will be the exit status is limited to 8 which can be treated as signed or unsigned by the program retrieving the you also get an 8 bit value identifying the signal number and core dump status of the terminated either the status or the signal bits are always zero often both when the process exits you know that the numbers to be returned are smaller than then exit status is not the way to as others have you have to use some other ipc in that if the only system calls permitted are then you have to conclude that the values will be less than or that overflows neither is satisfactory as a conclusion outside a homework but in the you are not limited to just 4 system calls also codes bigger than note that on the range of exit codes is much larger but you use the system calls listed in the when i do the value in status from is is there a reason for the low 8 bits of the status word encode the signal number and so the high 8 bits of the status word encode the exit and macros

 to xml is indeed the way textarray text based on the it looks like you just need a way of representing if somewhat indexentry in select new etiologycode null null code to set other properties in this note alternative is to extract it into a separate extension method has to be in a static static string this values you could parameterise the delimiter here if you return change your code indexentry in select new etiologycode null null code to set other properties in this note a note about answers have suggested using in the name of i would check for evidence of this being the right way to go before using if you think about and do similar things they create a buffer bigger than they need add data to resize it when and come out with a result at the the hope is that you need to resize too between and here is being buffered in the entire contents of the string built up so with in other resizing the internal buffer used for is likely to be cheaper than resizing the one for if the individual strings are doing the buffering in is hugely it can look through the strings to start work out how much space to and then concatenate it without ever having to copy the actual character is in contrast to a previous answer but unfortunately i think i ever wrote up the certainly expect to be significantly and i think it makes the code simpler here no need to use aggregation

 too many files in a single directory can lead to not only performance will suffer at a certain but a friend way more experience than told me that some backup programs have problems with when i had to store thousands of images i always created 256 and stored the files in the directory mod protect yourself against hackers there are a lot of things to and nothing will be safe hackers will most likely try to get root access and then your data safe so regular audit log files what not security per but may help you in discovering security holes and fix set the file permissions accordingly on shared servers without if an action really is done by the right it must be impossible to do harm by guessing the more if you want to make the filenames and possible to not directly link to the but to a script that serves that in this case able to store the files outside the webroot your more independent of code at the more step would be to avoid id values to identify better use an unique hash without a correlation to the id and store that in the database youtube and flickr do for passing through would be something if if if if any error then 404 404 not echo we find this would query the solution is because the webserver serve images directly rather not store the images in the exports would get backups a

 typechecking arguments in python is not it is your code accepts addresses as rawstring or as a is comes from the fact that if you know already the type of in your own then doing something wrong hurts code reuse and reduces having a performs different things depending on the type of the object and has a behavior harder to understand and have following saner a object constructor that accepts or a converts strings in make your function assume passed is a that if you need to pass to the you just your best it is easy to understand and reading the code immediatelly understands what is you have to two one that accepts objects and one that you can make one call the other in the most way can create a object and or the other way objects have a method and inside your on the received that way you always get a any it is completely unnecessary and has refactor your code instead in a way you need to only get benefits in doing both in short and long

 typical problem of this approach is that the file is still being copied while the event is you will get an exception because the file is locked during an exception is especially likely on large a workaround you could first copy the file and then rename it and listen to the renaming another option would be to have a while loop checking whether the file can be opened with write if it can you will know that copying has been code could look like this a production system you might want to have a maximum number of retries or timeout instead of a waits until a file can be opened with write static void while using stream if file catch file not yet ready catch file not yet ready catch file not yet ready another approach would be to place a small trigger file in the folder after copying is your filesystemwatcher would listen to the trigger file

 understand what you mean with did lazy lazy loading is a it is turned on by default and you can turn it off if you like are two kinds of lazy for references to other entities and for this int id private reference to another user myuser list to other mycomments loading on the reference to you have lazy loading on the you need to define all members of the user class nhibernate will create a so called the proxy is a classed defined at runtime which derives from your code is accessing it as user and is not aware that is is a but when you access one of its members the first the properties are loaded from the you want to turn off lazy loading on the user you need to do this in its nhibernate creates always instances of type no you need to have anything loading on the list of you use lazy loading on the list of it is the list itself that implements the lazy if you access the list the first it is loaded from the nhibernate uses a list that implements but is not you want to turn off lazy loading in the you do this in the mapping of lazy loading is a good and you application does not have to care about it but there are some for if you serialize a and it is a you get a not initialized proxy instead of anything lazy loading only works as long as the session is it is not always faster to use lazy if you need to load all the data its faster to load it in one the configuration needs to be done answer your original is lazy loading required for is lazy loading required in my most probably only small and rather trivial applications need lazy if you have a system with many persistent need lazy

 understanding of async is that notified when done via an interrupt of some sort so you can do more at that with buffered you do it and forget about you never hear about that particular least how it is with the huge intelligent disk arrays we deal idea of async is that you begin the and return to doing other when the is notified and can do more in other not waiting around for it to for the synchronous read you request some input and then wait around while read from the buffering there just involves reading more than you need so available on the next read without going out to the device to get you simply start the process to read then you go off and do something else while whether by polling or an you later discover that the read is finished and the data is available for you to not sure i can see the advantage of one over the buffered sync writes will return almost immediately unless the buffer is full the only time when an async write may have an

 unit tests should be reasonably the fewer the more likely your test is to target a specific feature and not mix testing for multiple features in the same does this mean that all tests should only have one but i would consider it a if i found several potentially testing multiple things in the same unit treat this like you would a code smell and refactor the test to refine it so that it only tests one even if it requires more than one doing an mvc project now and one of the tests that i write is that the correct view is rendered by the there may actually be several of these if different code paths may result in different this is how i define it being the correct the result is the correct type and has the correct this requires two but only testing one result as result might do something similar with the but i would not test that the model is correct in the same test as checking the view because these are different aspects of the behavior of the i could change the expected model or view and by putting it in a separate only those tests concerned with that feature of the method need to be

 use packed structures that are overlaid directly over the binary packet in memory today and i am rueing the day that i decided to do the only way that we have gotten this to work is defining specific types based on the compilation environment unsigned int the appropriate pragmas in to specify tight packing of structure that everything is in one byte order network or writing both the server and client you are just starting i would advise you to skip the whole mess of trying to represent on the wire with just serialize each primitive element if you choose not to use an existing library like boost serialize or a middleware like then save yourself a lot of headache by writing an abstraction around a binary buffer that hides the details of your serialization aim for an interface bytebuffer void void void void void void each of your classes would have a method to serialize to a or be deserialized from a and this is one of those things that i absolutely wish that i could go back in time and i cannot count the number of times that i have spent time debugging an issue that was caused by forgetting to swap bytes or not packing a other trap to avoid is using a to represent bytes or to an unsigned char buffer to extract if you always use on the then you can use simple code to write the bytes to the buffer and not worry about the remains nicely platform agnostic since the numerical representation is always logically this code also lends itself very nicely to using templates based on the size of the primitive type char not so but very easy to write and

 virtual call has to check for being null and a virtual call does so i see in generally why a virtual calls would be in special cases the compiler jit be able to inline the virtual call better then a as a compiler has access to better type the call method instruction be slower in as the jit may be able to use a quicker instruction that only copes with a small offset as it know more about the runtime memory layout and processor model then a we are talking about a handful of processor instruction at most on a modem superscalar it is very possible that the instruct is run at the same time as the and therefore takes no is also very likely that all the processor instructions will already in be the level 1 cache if the call is make in a but the data is less likely to be the cost of reading a data value from main memory these days is the same as running 100s of instructions from the level 1 therefore it is unlucky that in real applications the cost of a virtual call is even measurable in more then a very few fact that the code uses a few more instructions will of course reduce the amount of code that can fit in the the effect of this is impossible to

 want to have a bare git repository stored on a network i use and have the said network share mounted with my coleague uses windows and has the network share automounted as a network wonder if i can use the repo from both without concurrency already and on my end i can clone but afraid of what might happen if we both access the same repo at the same the git faq there is a reference about using network file systems some problems with but i am not sure if there is any file locking done by the quite sure there has anyone used a git repo on a network without a and without i want to avoid using an http server the because i do not have access to the server with the i know we can just from one to but we are required to have the on the share for worries are not about the possibility of a network even we would have the required branches and be able to compile our we usually commit quite and need to from my point of the best option would be to have a central repo on the share the backups are and we would both clone from that and use it to due to the fact we are doing this i am afraid about if it happens that we both at the same we could at each other each time we access the remote repo but it would be better to have it secured by the it is possible that git has an internal mechanism to do this someone can push to one of your while you work on but i found anything conclusive repo on the share drive would be a not containing a working in a git repo on a network shared

 was asked this very question in an interview a couple weeks ago heard whether i got the me it was several assignments in my first programming class after the basic intro it was the first time a course in web design was offered at my since it was several graduating seniors signed up and comprised about half the the instructor was used to teaching and already knew many of those in the basically he taught it at their rather than for the other half of the class who were pretty the most difficult assignment was writing a i had problems with parsing for the various tags and asked for the instructor if had the compilers course you could just write a simple at that point was a black box that did magic things before the program i really know what it much less was i able to write thing that made it difficult was not having the tools necessary to do the to include understanding the results i got when i pages and apis are great if you already understand what you are looking but not for teaching a in my experiences learned the most when i had a mentor who if stuck more than a couple let me know so i can get you unstuck and moving much better than those who want to hear from me except every week or

 was curious about this all fine to read documentation and theoretical but i like to balance those with empirical have a mysql table that has records in the table is in my own private so i know the contents are static and nobody else is using the i think this effectively removes all outside affects on i have a table with an primary key field that i know will never be null that i will use for my where clause test id is not only other possible glitch i see in running tests is the the first time a query is run will always be slower than subsequent queries that use the same refer to that below as the cache seeding just to mix it up a little i ran it with a where clause i know will always evaluate to true regardless of any data said here are my where where id is not null where 9 min sec 6 min sec 2 min sec 6 min sec 1 min sec 2 min sec 6 min se 1 min sec 1 min 5 min sec 1 min sec 2 min sec 5 min sec 1 min sec 2 min 6 min sec 2 min sec 2 min 6 min sec 1 min sec 1 min is considered the cache seeding it is expected to be slower than the say the results speak for usually edges out the adding a where clause dramatically decreases the access time even if a clause you know will evaluate to the sweet spot appears to be where id is not would love to see other perhaps with smaller tables or with where clauses against different fields than the field sure there are other variations i taken into

 was intended as a comment on a previous but i guess too a child class with a constructor that takes an instance of a parent class and copies data from it is a fairly widespread one way to minimize the headache that this can cause with multiple levels of inheritance and other classes is to create a protected function that does this in this instance call it consider that we have three and they each inherit from the other in that class private string public string get return set name protected void name we define class employee private int public public public int get return set employeeid protected new void employeeid we follow the same example for class manager private string public public public string get return set department protected new void department the method in each class declared so that we can change the and is there to provide shallow copy functionality to inherited note that this pattern creates a new object that just has the same data as the old the old object still exists and existing references point to your new actually changing an type is not	
 was involved in a discussion at work about which software systems various people had built were the biggest in this case being a combination of system complexity and implementation experienced programmers tend to get a gut feel for a even if they put it in i thought pose the question to systems under discussion telecoms billing 4 main time call control where call credit was reserved from a database every call least cost custom per user of 1000 simultaneous calls per billing and core wagering system for the racing 4 main application supporting 1000 cash outlets and 200 seat call a fixed odds payouts calculated based on deducting a comission and sharing pools amongst 20 different bet max combination bet being first 4 and customer relationship management 4 main user integration delivering to different queues based on recipient serivce api with authorisation for 3rd party are an abundance of details missing but the thrust of the question is to rank the systems in order of descending above for any scale will be arbitrary but to give it some relevance the scale below is space shuttle life support application hello world be interested to see the rankings for the 3 systems above plus any other big systems people have worked in slotted in to give systems ranked in order of complexity

 was the first have one or more mainboards with one or more cpu chips on the main problem here was that the cpus would have to expose some of their internal data to the other cpu so they get in their next step was one chip on the mainboard but it had some parts twice internally so it could execute two instructions at the same current development is basically the original idea complete but in a single the chip designers can easily put the additional wires for the sync signals into the chip of having to route them out on a then over the crowded mainboard and up into a second computers today are they have lots of mainboards with usually cpus on each cpu is and each has its own you got that pretty much just a few minor duplicates internal to reduce context switch resources can arithmetic unit you can do several integer or even floating point calculations or you can do an add and a multiply at the same time but not add and main problem with is that code running on them will eventually access the there are n cpus but only one bus to access the so you must have some hardware which makes sure that each cpu gets a fair amount of ram that accesses to the same part of the ram cause problems and most that cpu 2 will be notified when cpu 1 writes to some memory address which cpu 2 has in its internal if that cpu 2 will happily use the cached oblivious to the fact that it is imagine you have tasks in a list and you want to spread them to all available so cpu 1 will fetch the first element from the list and update the cpu 2 will do the for efficiency both cpus will not only copy the few bytes into the cache but a whole that may the assumption is when you read byte soon read both cpus have a copy of the memory in their cpu 1 will then fetch the next item from the without cache it have noticed that cpu 2 has changed the and it will start to work on the same item as cpu is what effectively makes so side effects of this can lead to a performance which is worse than what get if the whole code ran only on a single the solution was you can easily add as many wires as you need to synchronize the you could even copy data from one cache to another of a cache line without having to flush and reload or the cache logic could make sure that all cpus get the same cache line when they access the same part of real simply blocking cpu 2 for a few nanoseconds until cpu 1 has made its the main reason why is simpler than is that on a you simply run all wires between the two chips which need to make sync plus a signal only travels tops of in a you usually have much and forget on a signals start to influence each other we like to think that 0 is 0v and 1 is 5v but in is something between when dropping a line from and and is anything above you have everything inside of a single signals run much faster and you can have as many as you like almost signal crosstalk is much easier to

 was wondering if it was possible to get the nth return value from a function without having to create dummy variables for all return values before say i have the following function in suppose that only interested in the third return this can be accomplished by creating one dummy but i think this is kind of would think that you might be able to do something like one of the following but you there any elegant ways to do this that do far the best solution is to simply use the variablethatiwilluse as a dummy this saves me from having to create a real dummy variable that polutes the workspace that i would need to in the solution is to use the variablethatiwilluse for every return value up until the interesting return values after can simply be still think this is very ugly but if there is no better then i guess accept the to elegantly ignore some return values of a matlab

 way i the memory allocation and is to pass it off to custom pass the container an let it worry about malloc and when i remove the object let it worry about the of course this only works if you are only storing an object in one if i have object references all over the place i will create the equivalent of constructor and destructor methods with c void object i mean anything you would point to not	
 way is to create a dummy assign it and pass that	
 way is to use this is more efficient than using and then casting each time both the and the cast require prod setting as for when to use and when to use a using really easy	
 way late to the party but for future searchers used the following algorithm for a personal app i of the region to reduce is selected by the user and passed to the red eye reducing method as a center point and the method loops through each pixel within the radius and does the following of red divided by average of blue and pixel redintensity because it gives the best reduce red to the average of blue and really like the results of this because they keep the color which means the light reflection of the eye is not means eyes keep their

 way of doing what you need is to include your file in every page that has the login form and just post to that same so you need any redirection at maybe is not a good scalable and maintainable but it is it all depends what kind of app you are but you are saying that you are new to php so you can start like you can always go fancy	
 way of handling this is to load that list of methods at runtime into a and then for each use the that something like this this code is simplified and omits error extends methods method if when you want to call look up the method in the by argument type and use that show this again with simplified but this time full note that to be fully the code gets a little more as is shown if you have to worry about primitives depends on your or if you have to worry about interfaces or then you can simplify the example if you can guarantee that there will be no overlap in interfaces or superclasses in the arguments that you have to worry you can move all of the complicated logic into initialization matter if it takes 1 ms in this all of the logic in would be moved into the where you would loop over all interfaces and superclasses of each method you find and add them to your if you do this then becomes a single without this optimization and with full my example of how to do class test private final parametertypemap new private final tests new new new public methods for method if clazzes if if see private void if else if and so on for the other six primitive types public void for test method method if found for try catch private method method method if return look for x while null x method if return x look for for i method if return return public static void test test new setters public void public void public void public void public void	
 way this can be done is by using the content setting in the you can set the expiration date for that folder to some date far in the editor folder properties http headers content expiration checkbox in	
 way to cause an implicit loop across the columns of a matrix is to use that you must first convert the matrix to a cell each cell will hold one then call for that here computed the standard deviation for each many functions in matlab are already set up to work on rows or columns of an array as the user this is true of std of but this is a convenient way to test that cellfun worked	
 way to do this is actually within your render could also make the actual html a partial and turn the rendering off under certain	
 way to do this is probably to have the parent class to define an abstract and have the children implement not a great way to do it in this but it in some cases it can be exactly what you	
 way to exit insert mode is to use not sure whether that helps in your situation	
 way to look at it is as a compression recognition you want to take a whole bunch of throw out most of and categorize the if i were doing this probably proceed as with a rolling history the center of gravity of the four points in the start save and subtract it out of all the positions in all each frame into two the shape of the constellation and the movement of cofg relative to the last the absolute cofg for the last frame series of cofg changes gives you series of constellation morphing gives you seeing your photo points each not four points on modify the above as the cofg calculation on with the caveats there are four points pairs are chosen to minimize the product of the intrapair there are three points the closest two are one the other one is the prior following frames to override when of a got a nested structure of distance orientation pairs one between the and one more for each the full reduced data to recognizers for each and let them sort out what they care you want to get do a little dsl to recognize the and write things in over over	
 way to look at the precise meaning of a const pointer is that you will not be able to make changes to the object that would be visible via that or any other pointer or reference to the same but when an object all other pointers to the address previously occupied by the object no longer pointers to that they store the same but that address is no longer the address of any object fact it may soon be reused as the address of a different distinction would be more obvious if pointers in behaved like weak as soon as the object is all extant pointers to it would immediately be set to the kind of thing considered to be too costly at runtime to impose on all and in fact it is impossible to make it entirely	
 way to share data between different view controller classes is through the app example you could have defined in you app delegate and then access in both of your view controller class as	
 way to x is not a a x is x using exceptions more depending on the what the code is doing if it returns none because there was an using an exception is probably the correct x x that there really anything wrong with you original x is not a a but i find that far easier to read much more than either of the following x if x is not none else x or	
 way would be to have another table that holds each value but since you want to go that route a delimited list should just make sure that you pick a delimiter that show up in the you can also store the data as xml depending on how you plan on interacting with the data this may be a better	
 way you get all teams with the number of hiered employee inner join management by by a additional having clause and abdonning the join the ceo name is not required as i just you get your desired result as employee by select from select as from employee group by may actually return multiple rows if several managments hired the same number of and it is ugly but ad hoc i know no better way to do it in a single	
 way you have specified is one way you can do there is no function because it is already implements the no point in creating a function specific to a may consider returning the interface in the same manner subsonic for idatareader return new performing the assignment in your reader would consider this the best way to do

 ways i can think of in probable order of a linux program that listens on a network socket for your windows app sends the appropriate the linux program runs the command to set the environment variable something like this be secure over the network unless you make it ssh to login to the linux then run a script to set the i know if there are ssh libraries around for windows but be surprised if there putty is an excellent windows ssh client so you may be able to use code from there but you should check the license first depending on how you plan to use your this option has the benefit that you can use pki to secure the network if	
 ways you could approach two queries in your tab one for active users and one for inactive then on your report simply drop two tables and point one of them at the dataset and the other at the the one query which returns all active or along with a column for their now drop two tables on your report and point them both at this single in the properties of each set up the filter so that one table only shows active users and the other shows inactive favour one of these approaches over the but probably lean towards the second approach since only one round trip to the the overhead of filtering during the report rendering might not make it worth though have to try it and	
 wcf can use it the wcf rest library is ready to usable in wcf starter kit is something it delivers extra it includes a set of vs project samples and a few tools for building rest apps or with one cool tool is the xml as command to visual the other building a rest in the general recommend taking advantage of the httpclient assembly in the starter kit and a and dependency even at the current status of the starter you were consuming just a single rest then you need the general you can do all the stuff it does in some code that uses but if you wanted a more general flexible class for manipulating rest then grab that	
 wcf web references are generated by the ide very similarly to references to asmx or other web which means that it breaks things down into a method such that the client calling code operates as though it were invoking a remote if only new stuff that does not alter the expected existing functionality is then old clients do not need to

 we did on our project was to iterate through all of the class files and see what extended testcase reference the do a class clazz and then do a to definitely got messy something is a base class that supposed to be for and those would have to be if it is in a suite is even i would use my own suite builder class and require all suites be built using and add logic to it to record all existing classes that are referenced by the which then passes them to the and the checker knows that they are accounted problem is that all of this breaks in making it instant legacy most stable solution junit solves its suite building is to have a development culture that either names all of its tests with a naming conversion standard is ending in and has ant run or while developing the test only runs them via the	
 we have a class a and class b and c inherit from we create an array of references to and fill it with and we decided that we want to eliminate all the is there a way to check what type each field of the array really holds without doing something redundant like a fixed of to of references to real variable type in polymorphism	
 we have a dba to answer so our preference is for option simply save the enum value into the and when we are loading data out of the database and into our domain we just cast the integer value to the enum avoids any of the synchronisation headaches with options and the list is defined once in the we have a policy that nobody else accesses the database they must come through our web services to access any so this is why it works well for

 we look at enterprise application design then the methods for fetching users getuserbyid and getallusers would be in separate class you can name it userdata or userdao data access you should design an interface for userdao with appropriate methods for handling user objects such as getuserxxx and so should be an implementation of userdao as per the data for example if your users are stored in database then you can implement the logic of accessing database in the implementation of are the advantages of keeping the access methods in separate user object should be plain object with just getter setter this would facilitate passing object across tiers from data access to business tier to web this would also help keep user object the data access logic is loosely coupled from the user object that means if the datasource then you need not change the user object this also assists in test driven development where you might need to have mock objects during testing if user object is complex object with relations with other objects such as address or department or role then the complexity of relationships will be encapsulated in userdao rather than leaking in the user porting to frameworks like nhibernate or or linq would become easier if the patterns are

 we received a mockup for a website from a client that makes extensive use of the font all over the layout for menu articles block never heard of that font before and i assumed that it web also i checked online in several places to confirm like and but find any reference to this after telling to the designers that we are going to need to use some kind of text replacement technique for using this font they told us that this a web safe font and that they checked in windows and mac and the font is we are going to use this font but still curious if this is a standard font or installed with an adobe product or any other anyone have any info on rockwell a web safe	
 we use port 443 that i have the mysites set on a different port and that was primarily for a method to ensure that it not accessible through the firewall and also because ssl and host headers are a pain with iis and network services wanted to cut down on the number ip address web applications i have run into have no problem using host headers or different as for end user i think we are probably at the point were they are able to under ports and enter a different one when	
 we worked on the issues of dreamfall and age of we came across a few issues that are worth keeping in some of these we some were solved for and some we worked some we never sure all your tools and all your code supports all the charsets you want to and double check that assumption twice during the course of the project and a couple more times to be sure you use a font that supports all the languages you want to most fonts that claim to be unicode are only unicode in the sense that the characters it has is at the correct it does not mean it has usable characters for all is not only done at as some languages space to separate words comes to make sure your routines handles text without any spaces at plural correctly is tricky in the easy and damned hard in the hard make sure you know enough about the languages be using to be able to write code to handle the plural issue keep in mind that english the other languages are among the easy break sentences and build strings with them to fit a as the variable might be placed elsewhere in the sentence in a different use in mind that for some the value of the placeholder might change how to write the grammar is make sure you have a plan for dealing with make sure you have a way to classify the values you use in the placeholders according to

 website made for humans to read is always a i do this for some years now and never been always a good idea to look out for the data you need in some other from like xml or keep in mind the website layout may change and you have to adapt your but the main problem is finding the information you need on the we always need a lot of string methods like is some kind of xml so maybe an xmlparser would but browsers are always a bit more tolerant and will accept and display many pages who are not well

 well implemented tab interface should not confuse line with what others have said one of the most ipmortant things to consider with or any other navigation interface is for it to be obvious where they currently are in the navigation important point is not to break the many ajax or javascript implemtations break the back this is a minor annoyance to some and a major inconvieniece to make sure to consider your target audience i prefer the oldschool method of not preloading all of the tabs but having each tab as its own page and using a templating methodology to manage the navigation be it tabbled or this maintains the browser history and works fine with or without

 what its the code in the op is a mess not because it uses but because the values in the tuple are too weakly compare the get upset too if my dev team were passing around ids rather than class instances because an integer can represent that being tuples are extremely useful when you use them exist to group ad hoc values they are certainly better than creating excessive numbers of wrapper alternative to parameters when you need to return more than one value from a tuples in make my eyes many languages like and so on have a concise syntax for defining for in the defines a constructor as list can create an instance of a map val values list values val dict dict equilvalent code in is values new new new new new new var dict new believe there is anything wrong with tuples but syntax is too cumbersome to get the most use out of

 what many seem to prolog and other related languages has used in many commercial quite often it is not the reasons for this may one relatively old database is kept the many other applications have been developed as posts by companies there are fields where it has been applied with quite a such as bioinformatics learning of drug shapes and protein but of course these are not applications in the sense that you do not get them sold over the the impact they have is the talking about is hard to wholeheartedly agree with the poster who states that prolog is overlooked in many because the way it has been taught does not empashize practical but quite often theoretical on the other prolog by itself is just an example of a logic programming logic programming offers much more tools than just prolog set constraint and narrowing the possibilties of lp to just prolog is not making justice to	
 what most of the answers so far the meaning is exactly the same as in any two expressions a and b evaluating to a b and a b do almost the same b evaluates a and and if one of them evaluates to the result is b does almost the same except it evaluates a and then only evaluates b if it is since the entire expression is true if either a or b is b need to be tested at all if a is so and skips evaluating the second operand when where the operator will always evaluate operator often and often it make a the only common case i can think of where make a difference is foo null assuming returns a works because the member function is never called if the left test that if foo is we call dostuff on would give us a used the would be called regardless of whether foo was null or only the operator is and is a bitwise as the other answers the operator defined for integer types so hard to get them mixed up in	
 what point are you trying to access the if you try within init of a the iboutlets will be the first method you can get at them is probably reason it does make sense to do things this way is that iboutlets are just direct pointers to some even if they are already subviews of something just saves a lot of helmstetter

 when quite common to change from a pointer to a reference if you had by including a suffix on the variable name indicating that a you would then have to change that to something all over the that seems like so much pointless that just makes the code harder to edit and shape into what you need that kind of it will be quite clear from usage if a variable is a pointer or for

 while back a post by jon skeet planted the idea in my head of building a for using in a loop instead of idea is that the portion of a call to spent parsing the format string is we be able to improve performance by moving that code outside of the the of is that the new code has to match the week i finally did i actually went through using the framework source provided by to do a direct adaption of their parser turns out actually farms the work to the code i came up with in that my results are accurate within my test i still have one in my initial tests the performance of my code closely matches that of the normal no improvement at even consistently a few milliseconds at least still in the same order the amount slower it stays within a few milliseconds even as the test set but i was hoping for something possible that the internal calls to are what actually drive the but like to see if the smart people here can improve on things is the relevant class public int of item in the argument means a literal from the original format public data from original format public string format to use with supplied argument for for format public int means it should be at least 7 characters public bool would use opposite data is all populated by the parts new int basesize string iformatprovider formatprovider icustomformatter customformatter the code in here very closely matches the code in the could it be string if null args throw new var sb new foreach fi in if throw new if throw new object arg string s if s if if is s else if s if s int pad if pad if pad return implementation comparative my own test call i use but useful to how my format method string return wary of providing the source code for my because not sure of the licensing implications from my reliance on the original anyone who wants to test this can just make the relevant private data public and assign values that mimic a particular format very open to changing the class and even the list if anyone has a suggestion that could improve the build since my primary concern is iteration time from front to end maybe a linkedlist would fare something else i can try is adjusting my my benchmarks were fairly composing names to a format and composing formatted phone numbers from the area and extension neither of those have much in the way of string as i think about how the original state machine parser i think those string literals are exactly where my code has the best chance to do well because i no longer have to examine each character in the class is still even if i make it go as long as performance is than the base still created a interface that allows a program to assemble own at run all i need to do is provide public access to the parts comparing to

 with all good simplified what actually trying to this is but it is worth noting that python has a of flexibility when it comes to class versus instance the same can be said of for a good list of i recommend starting especially sections 2 through thing that takes a lot of work to remember when getting started is that is not more than just a in an entire class is making the namespace resolution real any variables declared outside a method are instance if variables and are implicitly accessible within the grand rule of thumb is that there are three namespaces that are in for current are limited exceptions to the main one that occurs to me is when a class definition is being the class definition is its own implicit but this lasts only as long as the module is being and is entirely bypassed when within a class foo bar class foo def return bar recent call file line in class file line in bar file line in return global name is not the the thing to remember is that you have access to any of the variables you want to but probably not if your goals are simple and then going for or will probably be if your example is getting more or you want to do fancy things like inheritance can inherit or the idea of referring to the name of your class within the class itself seems wrong to check out the intro i

 with marc and unkown above 6 indexes in the clustered index is way too especially on a table that has only 14 you have more than 3 or if i would say 1 or maybe you may know that the clustered index is the actual table on the disk so when a record is the database engine must sort it and place it in sorted organized place on the non clustered indexes are they are supporting lookup my vldbs are laid out on the disk according to the 1st point your clustered index to 1 or the best field choices are the identity if you have or a date field in which the fields are being added to the or some other field that is a natural sort of how your data is being added to the the point is you are trying to keep that data at the bottom of the table or have it laid out on the disk in the best way that read the records this makes it so that there is no reorganzing going on or that taking one and only one hit to get the data in the right place for the best be sure to put the removed fields into indexes so you lose the lookup i have never put more than 4 fields on my if you have fields that are being update frequently and they are included in your clustered going to reorganize the record on the disk and cause costly the fillfactor on your the larger the fill factor number the more full the data pages and index pages will in relation to how many records you have and how many records your are inserting you will change the fillfactor or of your indexes to allow for the fill space when a record is if you change your clustered index to a sequential data then this matter as much on a clustered rule of thumb fillfactor for high for medium and for high by dropping your fillfactor to will mean that for every 100 records on a 70 records are which will leave free space of 30 records for new or reorganized eats up more but it sure beats having to defrag every night 4 sure the statistics exist on the if you want to sweep the database to create statistics using the then sql server will create all the statistics on all the indexes that the engine has accumulated as requiring leave off the attribute though or add statistics for every that would then not be the using dbcc showcontig to see which indexes are getting fragmented the i go into the details just know that you need to do then based on that change the fillfactor up or down in relation to the changes the indexes are experiencing change and how fast a job schedule that will do online or offline on individual indexes to defrag do dbcc dbreindex on this large of a table without it being during maintenance time cause it will bring the apps down especially on the clustered been test and test this the execution plans to see what and fat pipes exist and adjust the then defrag and rewrite stored procs to get rid of those hot if you see a red object in your execution because there are not statistics on that this step is more of the than the off peak run the update statistics with fullscan to give the query engine as much information about the data distributions as you otherwise do the standard update statistics standard on tables during the weeknights or more often as you see fit with your observerations to make sure the engine has more information about the data distributions to retrieve the data for this is so but extremely only give you here minimal information but will help a some gut feelings and observations that go in to strategies used by these points that will require your time and need to go to enterprise i did though in order to get the features spoken of earlier with but i did especially to have much better capabilities with searching and online defraging and maintenance in enterprise it is much much better and more friendly with standard edition handle doing dbcc indexdefrag with online databases as

 work for over the past couple of days been researching what it takes to get our framework to play nicely with the main key is to run the server in console mode of as a windows the reason for this is to allow the unit test run phase to be able to interact directly with the which is required for ui generally code that runs under a windows service is not allowed to interact with the desktop ours and thus will fail when it is also another good ci looking at that right now and have gotten it mostly figured you have any other more specific questions feel free to contact us at also monitor this thread as is not unfortunately it lacks any sort of visualstudio integration and is missing many other features that we	
 work in a shop that has both and mvc i think originally i was biased toward web forms because i worked with them from several but after working on a few mvc projects i prefer to is that if you have a team of experienced web form developers initial progress in an mvc application will be a slower because of the learning so if the timeline for a project is very tight it might not be the best time to from that i think of any situations where prefer web forms over mvc at this	
 work on a project where we have to create unit tests for all of our simple beans is there any point to creating a unit test for pojos if all they consist of is getters and is it a safe assumption to assume pojos will work about of the of pojos be it bad practice to run tests on a db instead of on fake there a java framework that getters and tests for

 worked in a team where we used cruise and my history had been with wise i see that much difference between the however the cruise product has significantly more from a ui and usability seemed to hold your hand in some of the configuration the upside i guess is a standardised approach across all i did feel as if some of this was forcing you to configure your project somewhat around the always a bit skeptical of my two cents comparing cruise this was

 working in delphi delphi but my question is language you have a which sends messages to another i assume tclient instances would have a private reference variable of type a method somewhere in tclient would create an instance of tfacade and assign it to this private the tclient client class would need to use the tfacade tfacade works with other classes them and presumably tfacade instances do the same have private workerclass and create instances of the workerclasses in the tfacade tfacade classes need to use the workerclass how does information get from the workerclasses back to if tclient is a for it might receive user input which is used by in used by the after workerclasses have manipulated or used they need to communicate information back to tclient output information will be displayed in the tclient hope this is basically just asking if class1 calls a method in and class2 calls a method in how does class3 send information back to since i am a be afraid of being too simple or too specific in your i can handle it as always al communication between

 working on a project that has to connect to some ancient webservices that pack some hierarchical data for requests and responses into single strings of hierarchical been using to generate xsds from sample request and response xml modifying them where necessary to be the best possible and using again to generate the managers that call the webservices can then take those request objects as serialize them to strings in order to make the get the responses back as deserialize them into the response objects and return i a list of i can have a valid xsd that considers it a complex type of an unbounded of and then it will deserialize simply to a string which is nice and simple to deal the annoying problem is that for some there seem to be any way to get it to call the string array anything other than no matter i add to the i get to write any other an example xsd the resulting partial class accountstatusrequest private public items get return set tried adding pretty much every attribute in intellisense to both the choice and the inner and nothing makes a for the sake of i added a couple extra similar choices to that to see if that would force it to use a name for the string but instead it gave me really want it to have to be an array of its own type that only holds a but i also really want to leave it called without xml comments anyone know how to add those to an when it should have a more descriptive and i definitely just change it manually as the desired workflow whenever the webservice schemas change is to change the xsds and then the classes from seems like another one of those things should is there something should i take a different approach or is there an alternative tool i can use for this instead less can i get arrays to have a name other than when generating code from an xsd

 working on a reporting system that allows the user to arbitrarily query a set of fact constraining on multiple dimension tables for each fact written a class that automatically assembles all the correct joins and subqueries based on the constraint and everything works as i have a feeling that not generating the most efficient on a set of tables with a few million these queries take about 10 seconds to and like to get them down in the i have a feeling if i could get rid of the the result would be much more than show you my actual schema is much more show you an analogous example that illustrates the point without having to explain my whole application and data that i have a database of concert with artists and users can arbitrarily tag the artists and the so the schema looks like say i want to query the database for all concerts happening within one month of for all artists with and performing at concerts with and best query been able to come up with looks like as as as as as as join artist on inner join venue on in select from inner join tag as a on inner join tag as b on in select from inner join tag as a on inner join tag as b on between and interval 1 query but i like having those multiple if i could accomplish the same logic purely using join i have a feeling the performance would drastically a perfect be using a real olap but my customers will be deploying to mysql or mssql or and i guarantee that a compatible olap engine will be so stuck using an ordinary rdbms with a star get too hung up on the details of this example real application has nothing to do with but it has multiple fact tables with an analogous relationship to the ones shown in this the and tables function as fact and everything else is a important to in this that the queries are much simpler to write if i only allow the user to constrain against a single or it only gets really tricky when i allow the queries to include and requiring multiple distinct my question what are the best techniques that you know of for writing efficient queries against multiple fact best way to join multiple fact

 working on an application that displays several videos at the videos are stored in the form of directories full of image for each frame there are up to 9 images that must be loaded from like to implement caching and for the this would be pretty but the complication is that the filesystem a network is nowhere near fast enough to display every so the readahead should choose which frames going to try to and only issue requests for those it would be best if it could take into account which images are already when deciding which frames going to came up with a greedy algorithm that will do but i was wondering if this is a problem been and there are algorithms out assuming that time is measured with respect to frame not to make this easier to how long it takes to load an the number of images to display for each frame from now to now loadable if this frame is the first one possible to load in return have for your caching and readahead of video

 would agree with others that a database would be your best you really are generating such a huge amount of data that it would cause a performance you might want to create two tables one as a source and another as an system would insert new data into the real time and a batch job would periodically move data from there to the archive when performance is a you would query only the smaller real time if you actually needed to query across all the you would query a view that unions the real time and archive

 would have expected to equal not entirely unlike expecting 1 1 multiplying by before taking the 12 bit precision floating point and truncation with your extended during truncated to 12 extended during r1 truncated to 12 extended during truncated to 12 extended during r3 truncated to 12 changing the order of causes the the error to and r4 if you add and in this the last bit so in not lost on if you add to the last bit of is lost and so the result is not the one the rounding removes a trailing the other the rounding removes a trailing both does not equal so the errors are not the have many more bits of and probably uses rounding rather than but hopefully this simple model shows you different errors can happen with different orderings of the same difference between fp and maths is that is shorthand for then rather than just	
 would have to do a lot to achieve any meaningful level of obfuscating the names alone is not since all of the standard functions will still be there they may be buried in a layer of and deriving the purpose of a particular function is easy once the code is formatted nicely anybody who really wants to know what your js code does and no matter what you do to it before their browser gets a copy of you have valuable business processes in your then doing it	
 would have to override the function where the loaderinfo instance is and that might be in a private in the new function you could then instanciate your custom loaderinfo class but you would also have to do anything else that the overwritten method you might run into some security sandbox problems with loadinfo as overwriting a function like this is usually only posible when the function written with this in you could use the prototype chain to change the loaderinfo class at but i recommend not good practice in my you get this to work you still have the problem that your custom event will not work with any event that has properties not inheritet from the event class the progressevent that has progress related would say you properly should look for another the question you link to you talk about sending movieclip with your have you thought about reaching the other when you recieve the you get a reference to the object that dispatched it can you not use that reference to get the you could explain your problem in more detail in a new question so you still keep this i am sure there is a better easier way to solve

 would not be but you can setup the open source version of the google code review tool previously noted by which is named it runs on google you could host this yourself using the appengine sdk and though i recommend this if the site is to be publicly visible as the sdk clearly notes that it is not meant for production and as such security is lightly google has also released a tool for converting appengine applications into pure django which you could then host via your favorite python web run on top of the demo application conversion included is actually rietveld so they have already taking care of this for see here for more	
 would not use either this the purpose of seems to be to process a that job is to process the in the second version of it is implicitly given a second to create the the semantics between version 1 and version 2 are not the of doing i would consider having just one function to process a and another function which creates the if you need such a const process return new these functions are and if all needs to do to get job done is literally just call then there may be no point in having the but sure that in your actual situation these functions do much more than what is being shown and my code above illustrates a fundamental approach to semantic one function one job to design i have above for the function also illustrates another fundamental approach that i personally use in my code when it comes to designing interfaces which includes function that is i believe that good interface is easy and intuitive to use and difficult or impossible to use in the case of the function we are implictly saying with my the vector is required to already exist and be by designing to take a reference instead of a it is both intuitive that the caller must already have a and they are going to have a hard time passing in something that a

 would probably use executereader to create an object in code from the the reason for this is that the datatable has more overhead than a because it has more functionality was probably created by a since you doing using the you need the being i would make a static helper method in the bookmanager static ibook book b new return reason for this is because the reason you have an interface is because you might want to change the you may eventuallu have inovel ireference ibook etc and then want to have an abstract factory implementation in your data static ibook sqlcommand command new or dr checking case return case return benefit of the dal here is that you can cache you can have a dictionary that holds books looked to reduce extra db calls on objects already when an update takes you remove the cached another post using multiple interfaces and helper methods will need to reside in a neutral right now in the there is movement towards less which means less is a link from a blog i read on this i think the answer is that the data layer returns an instance of your interface to the business luck	
 would put all the webmethods into the same the webmethods should only be wrappers around you business classes plus whatever input validation and authorisation you web services are generally used by mahcines and not humans there is no pressing need for a it can become a burden to manage the urls and web server if you create a webmethod class per business you are planning on using the html page that browsers automatically generate to call your web services as your main user interface you need to be a little bit for example you be able to rely on soap headers if you need to authenticate	
 would quite like the system to be quite easy to define new already have such a it is your in check constraints serve to prevent invalid data from being entered at a case like your example where you want to allow the value but flag it write a and have a client application issue an error if the view has any an view as select from table where 50 the raise an error from return you established a convention that all such views were named with a your client could select all such view names from the systables for the database in one then iterate that list by calling from logging an error for any that returned more than zero this would be adding a new error report would consist of nothing more than creating a view with the proper name not have to recompile the additional advantage is that adding any rule engine would require learning its domain specific language for writing training new staff on and even then inevitably there would be corner cases the rules easily your coders already know and based on a 17 year old ansi standard based on 20 earler years of so most of the corner cases have been ironed out of the

 would rethink your design you implemented the processing in a base you could subclass it with 2 alternatives that would be nearly first could be like where it takes an operation that returns a would rework this to use instead of having your own delegate second could just take a simple action and not provide a return both could use the same but provide a different way of you could also pass this off to other methods using the base which would provide a lot of this you could call this void int return var actionwindow new var funcwindow new int result would look something abstract partial class operatingwindowbase public void call asyncronously so you can protected abstract void class public t result private public protected override class action public protected override	
 would rework your design so that initialize potentially though normally have this be a public method called by the are called after making a you could do this the first time you go to just your members using the data from the derived will work around your with no real change in usage from the

 would say that it depends on the in a blog entry or text i would focus on the code to perform or demonstrate the desired i would probably give the obligatory nod to error even put in a check but stub the code with an in you can introduce a lot of confusion by including too much code that focus directly on the subject at in in shorter answers seem to be preferred so handling errors with wave of the may be more appropriate in this context as if i made a code sample available for i would generally make it as complete as possible and include reasonable error the idea here is that for learning the person can always go back to the and use that to help understand the code as actually my personal this is one of the issues that i have with how tdd is typically presented usually you only see the tests developed to check that the code succeeds in the main path of i would like to see more tdd tutorials include developing tests for alternate this aspect of i is the hardest to get a handle on since it requires you to not of what should but of all the things that could go

 would simply retrieve the object again on the other view but why not cache the object when it is first as dim members pseudo code a man return as dim members for each member in member data regarding the return should also consider caching the results of the query for a specified time or make it dependent on an you could also use the session object if it is user specific

 would suggest profiling your php code to find out where the most time is you can find tutorial about using xdebug to profile php on my then try to optimize the parts which consume the most time are called the most one of the best optimizations you can do is to replace php methods by functions if because they are orders of magnitude	
 would suggest to find dependencies between the parameters and then create structures or otherwise classes to keep those and pass them to your constructor instead of a bunch of things that seem related at first	
 would suggest using nmap nmap at appears to be appears to be 11 ip addresses hosts scanned in if you want to write it yourself is fair this is how i would do ip in do ping 1 echo is an explanation of each bit of the above list of ip can use the syntax to generate a list of for echo 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 also useful for things like which makes and each containing and to generate a list of do something echo loop over something in you use for thingy in 1 2 do echo to the ping command varies a bit with different different using os x default on the os x version of it will ping until which going to work for so will only try sending one which should be enough to determine if a machine is problem is the timeout which seems to be 11 seconds on this version of changed using the one second should be enough to see if a machine on the local network is alive or the ping command use ping 1 1 56 data ping statistics packets 0 packets packet ping we need to know if the machine replied or can use the operator to run a command if the first for echo echo nonexistantcommand echo should not command not so we can 1 1 echo is other way would be to use the exit code from the ping command will exit with 0 if it and a code if it in bash you get the last commands exit code with the variable to check if the command 1 1 0 echo is echo is ping we need to see the ping so we can redirect to with the for ping 1 1 echo is is to redirect discard the host is you use for command not errorcausingcommand to combine all ip in do for loop and the ping 1 1 ping and discard if 0 then check the exit echo is display the you could send this to a log file by using the echo is using the in a ip in do ping 1 1 echo is each ping command takes about 1 second we set the timeout flag to 1 it can only run one ping command at a the obvious way around this is to use so you can run concurrent but beyond what you should use bash threads a first explains how to use the python threading module to write a although at that i would once again suggest using	
 would suggest you get on some sort of evidence based estimation classify your work assignments into categories such new tecniquie base estimate work base estimate fix code i wrote base estimate x fix code someone else wrote base estimate fix on threaded code base estimate a bit of tracking you will get a baseline number and categories and be able to your work effort there are some good tools that do this for but your shop might not be in a position to adopt this credit if you miss your estimate do an aar and figure out why you missed and recategorize the work or create a new category if

 would suspect the confusion arises over how interfaces were implemented in as abstract classes and multiple and interface is simply a contract that says you will implement those code compile for the same reason this code wont would with interface void abstract class foo is declaring that foo implements it say anything else about you wanted to force derived classes to implement it you would interface void abstract class foo public abstract void if you really wanted the interface methods hidden by explicit then something like n8wrl posted

 would thank my lucky stars that sql server have oracle packages we need a way to take all these procedures and put them in one i make developers create and maintain two files for each they will love us long as ms never implements packages like oracle be a win in my for packages are simply a way to organize your stored procedures packages so that you have 100 stored procedures sitting but maybe 5 not stackable like packages in java or all packages are at the same package requires two the headers file and the body this creates frustration when adding new procedures to an existing because you cannot add the body without adding the even though it contains the exact same information as is in the here is a snippet from the header file of one of my procedure in out the corresponding procedure in the procedure in out the header file is useless and is simply another hurdle for the developer to step over when developing with on my we have a convention that all the commented documentation for each procedure goes in the along with the details of when it was added and by but that could just as easily be included in the	
 would think there would be some way to programatically detect if the object being acted on is a thus you could wrap your custom tbo logic in an if check for and if it is a template none of your logic would be general not considered good practice to have heavy amounts of logic in your as run regardless of context and you often run into situations such as which you want to it is better to put this type of logic in an sbo and call the sbo from the context where you want this logic to be ie by extending

 would you handle i have taken ownership of an existing app and database that was written in the database design is fairly meaning the main tables are fairly wide and developers have continued to tack on additional columns to the end of the this has resulted in columns that have a lot of nulls since they directly relate to the primary am considering splitting the main table out as a way to abstract myself from the years and years of i am certain that new fields will continue to be added as new requirements come the question as new fields are do you continue to grow the width of the existing or do you stop extending an existing table and split it out into a separate supporting table that will house new thereby creating a if you were to split the main what would your assume for this example i have a table called with 150 is a good name for the new the there are views and stored procs that will need to be modified to support any new but that is inevitable anyway when columns are in advance for any to handle column growth of flat

 writing some optimized c code that basically runs through an array and does something to each what it does depends on the current value of the element so something i if else if 2 else returning to c after many years working in dynamic where my practice has been to try to write straightforward code and not create lots of local variables for things that i can just refer to like am very much aware that best practices are to write readable code and trust that the compiler is smarter than you and will do good i were writing the code above in i would load into a register once and then just use that value each time because i know that is private memory and change between even a smart compiler might do a load every time because it be sure that the memory do i have to explicitly declare volatile for the compiler to not make this my question should i expect better performance by rewriting with a local variable like i val if else if 2 else does stuff like take care of this automatically for the code optimizing takes days to so even modest improvements will make a i store c array values in local variables if going to reference them

 wrong with cursors is that they are often both in and in are for keeping a stable resultset which you can retrieve they are implicitly created when your query is and closed when course keeping such a resultset requires some even faster these resources are the a cursor open is like keeping a fridge door do it for hours without but it does not mean you should never open your means get your results and sum you call the execute whole query and get the first results from the you append a condition to your for processing your cursors inside a procedure requires infamous context which happens every time you get a result of an query out of the involves passing large amounts of data between threads and synchronizing the is one of the most irritating things in of the less evident consequences of that behaviour is that triggers in oracle should be avoided if a trigger and calling a function is equal to opening the cursor selecting the updated rows and calling the trigger code for each row of this existence of the trigger the empty may slow down a operation or test script on create table int not 2 in 2 into 3 select 4 from 5 connect 6 level 7 rows in 2 in 0 truncate table 2 in 3 create trigger 2 after 3 on 4 for each 5 6 7 8 in 2 into 3 select 4 from 5 connect 6 level 7 rows in seconds without a seconds with an empty trigger doing

 xp your maximum program address space is then you have fragmentation due to and drivers loading up in to your address you have the problem of your heap best move is just to get it over with and run as a process a suddenly all these problems go you can use a better heap to mitigate heap fragmentation and you can try using virtualalloc to grab your memory in one big contiguous chunk then you get to manage it from to discourage from fragmenting you can split your bsp across complicated and and frankly just putting it on disk would be but in theory you could get better performance by having a group of processes exchanging if you can keep everything resident assuming you can be smarter than memory than the os can handle file which is a big each process would need far less memory and therefore run in to the 2gb address space of burn through a lot can mitigate the effects of fragmentation of the address space by allocating smaller this will have other nasty side but you could follow a backoff policy where you grab smaller and smaller chunks of memory if you fail to successfully frequently this simple approach will get you a program that works when it otherwise but the rest of the time performs as well as it computing just sound so much nicer than the other

 you are going to add a database to your it is going to try and add one of the sql express if you are using an actual sql server 2005 instance you want to connect to you just add it to your you will want to do is add a connection string will contain the basic connection info including database authentication in your and then you will be able to reference that connection string when trying to open a connection to the you can use w3 schools and their database for more the author of the question asked a good in the comments and i wanted to make sure this was visible to future viewers without having to scour the question xaisoft posed was out of what if you want to add a but you want to add a do we have a when you try to add a you are trying to add a database that will remain with the project regardless of where it is hosted that the host can run sql server express if you want to do you need to have sql server express to a database will allow you to point to the location of an existing sql server 2005 database anywhere long as you can properly i should also mention that regardless of what method you you will still need to learn about if you have a sql server express db packaged with your you will still need to use connectionstrings to establish a connection to that database so that you can then use queries and such on	
 you are going to use the employee id as a would you really want to delete it and all of their work in the make a status field in employee and set it or the employeeid is best if it stays unique across all companies so just let it be never let the users see the let them see the names name the columns companyid or will be more readable and easier to search

 you are restricted to stored procedures than your best choice is it works fairly well if your goal is to map classes one to one with result sets from stored are some quirks with the designer for sure but once you get them figured out it works very well for mapping result sets to is a big difference between using for orm and using a tool like nhibernate and mapping straight to your straight to tables gives your all the awesome stuff like lazy loading and the repository is my blog post on setting up using stored hope it	
 you are returning the results displaying then you have access to the raw data before it gets churned out in if then do your modifying on the raw data by adding the span tags in you are saying that your raw data may have html in you may be able to use a regex to detect whether you are inside an html and use instead of results into a dom parser and only do replace operations on the leaf text write your own parser to keep track of if you are inside an html tag or yank out all the html tags from your put in placeholders like balha blah blah then do your replace on the remaining then substitute your tags back

 you are wrong about the enterprise portion of your are acceptable in an enterprise the issue is typically with knowledge of the dataset and the mistaken idea that be able to write your more all before you start recreating common like filtering for your object unit of work a different question than scaling to millions of likely that you want to trim any of the which requires you customize all your data going poco probably is not the right with still mapping structures to a database in a separate adding extra logic that when scaled to a high level starts showing wear and tear on your need to provide a more specific set of questions to get a better but does not necessarily equal of etc lend themselves to quick development of unsupported as well as maintainability because of of the model used in the app and the wide adoption and understanding most but to support millions of likely going to sacrifice maintainability for performance and scalability design you just need to make the decision which are more typed datasets are saying typed datasets are faster than is like saying i can run but with this name tag i can run be careful to investigate unsupported claims about any particular tool and ask for a

 you can do this without the database being live then it should be important things to bear in mind are making sure that you have all the constraints that none of them will be affected by the change in column type if they are that you have mitigated for and that you are clear on the dependencies between those guess just make sure you have a clear process and that you follow	
 you can do with an app that has very variable heap requirements is to set your max heap size very high with and tune and so that the app will not hang on to a lot of memory when the heap shrinks does that with default note that this may cause performance problems when the memory actually used by the app varies both strongly and quickly in that case better off having it hang on to all the memory rather than give it back to the os only to claim it again a second you might also want to fiddle with the to ensure that the gc leave too much unclaimed objects lying which it tends to do when a lot of room for the heap to and which would defeat the goal of wanting the heap size to adjust to the

 you can use conditional references and things like marc gravell set this up for the project the best way to find out how to do it is probably to download the source and have a we use so only compatible with visual studio but we have build configurations for and so just a case of changing the current build to check that things still release scripts build both of

 you cannot use lambda expressions in the watch locals immediate as marc has pointed out this is incredibly i wanted to dive a bit further into the topic most people consider with executing an anonymous function in the debugger is that it does not occur in a the very act of definining and running an anonymous function changes the underlying structure of the code changing the in and in particular from the immediate is a very difficult the following var v1 var v2 func1 var v3 v1 particular code creates a single closure to capture the value closure capture is required whenever an anonymous function uses a variable declared outside for all intents and purposes v1 no longer exists in this the last line actually looks more like the v3 the function example is run in the debugger it will stop at the break now imagine if the user typed the following into the watch order to properly execute this the debugger more appropriatel the would need to create a closure for variable this is difficult but not impossible to really makes this a tough job for the ee though is that last how should that line now be for all intents and purposes the anonymous function deleted the v2 variable and replaced it with so the last line of code really now needs to v3 to actually get this effect in code requires the ee to change the last line of code which is actually an enc while this specific example is a good portion of the scenarios are even worse is executing that lambda expression be creating a new it should actually be appending data to the original at this point you run straight on into the limitations small example unfortunately only scratches the surface of the problems we run i keep saying write a full blog post on this subject and hopefully have time this

 you compare a float and an but the problem you will run into is on most float and int have the same size and wildly different precision neither type can hold all values of the other since one type cannot be converted to the other type without loss of precision and the types cannot be native doing a comparison without considering another type will result in precision loss in some you can do to avoid precision loss is to convert both types to a type which has enough precision to represent all values of float and on double will do just so the following usually does a f i

 you consider the notifier object not to be part of the model object which owns so that modifying the notifier as modifying the then make getnotifier a const method returning a const const but returns a to allow observers to return will then have to either mark as or else own it by pointer smart or reference rather than by either you avoid a it is usually preferable to embed objects rather than to but if this is a case where a notifier considered part of the model which uses then embedding is not owning it by reference forces you to initialize the reference when model is which leads to dependency which is no bad owning by smart pointer means as with you have to do anything about may be other ways to design things as addition of another but your comment because it needs to return a suggests to me that you can do exactly what you originally you just realise you	
 you consider the programming i suggest you consider your sounds like you want to detect words from a given i believe regular expressions are too strong i suggest you tokenize the incoming using something like or another compare your tokens to the list and continue you can do this using or another comparing pretokenized text should be faster than matching the whole text with regular

 you design a there will be methods exposed to the outer you should check the incoming data in this no checks are required in methods that you do not because only your code calls them and its logic should handle all cases you accepted in the exposed method library outer library library entry world method helpers you have accepted the supplied data in the entry you should perform the requested action and return the exspected that is handle all remaining clearify the situation inside the there might be null but only because of the not because of parameter there are two possibilties for the location of null checks inside the the first one if the called method knows how to handle null if do do something the second situation if you call a method that cannot handle null if do the work myself or call another do whole idea is to reject cases you cannot handle immideatly and handle remaining cases if the input is not valid you throw an this forces the library caller to supply only valid values and does not allow the caller to continue execution with meaningless return values the caller shallows the exception an

 you dim color1 that implicitly defined color1 as an integer because what i suggest your own benefit and that of anyone reading your that you use to explicitly define the type of your looks like trying to use the same color1 variable to contain both the integer and enumerated version of your going to get quite confusing because enumerated values can also be directly converted to and from integers if you explicitly force that to and then you know whether a particular value represents your own color coding system or the i suggest that you create a function that generates 1 of 4 random colors like as select case case return case return case return case return end use that function to initialize your random

 you need a collection of then an array may well be the best tool for the boxing is a comparatively expensive for a collection including of primitives that will be used as i almost always use an array to avoid repeated boxing and rarely worry about the performance difference between an array and an if a will provide more maintainable then i will always use a or as but your question was about unless there is some compelling reason not performance is that compelling almost always results in better in part because arrays play nice with as johannes already pointed out in a but also because of so many other have a very rich api and a large variety of implementations that can most be trivially swapped in and out for each collection can be trivially converted to an if use of an array version is collections grow more gracefully than an array which can be a performance work very well with arrays fairly tofubeer pointed array covariance is strange and can act in unexected ways that no object will act collections handle covariance in expected need to be manually sized to their and if an array is not full you need to keep track of that if an array needs to be you have to do that of this i rarely use arrays and only a little more often use an i do use very often just or my most frequent use of arrays is when the item being stored is a primitive and will be inserted and accessed and used as a if boxing and unboxing every become so fast that it becomes a trivial i may revisit this but it is more convenient to work with to store in the form in which it is always instead of

 you not just use a static variable specifically for those that will have the same as the you should probably think carefully about any concurrency but it sounds like the simplest way to keep a value just and although one instance of can be used to service multiple each one only serves one request at a time which suggests that multiple instances are created for concurrent request i validated but it does sound like it be safe to keep it in an instance answer suggests that you want this to be that sounds slightly odd to as unless got a of these events quite likely to only ever see them execute on different making the whole sharing business if you really do want that sort of suggest just using an instance variable in the class for exactly the reason described in the paragraph above

 you only need the anonymous you might be pretty close you just need to assign the principle to the thread do this from code running within the thread that you want to change by setting if you need to authenticate a windows user and assign that identity to the i think that you are going to have to make an unmanaged call to i see a way around some code that works with the anonymous user assumes an web where you have a tag on the form named and you have assigned the code runs differently depending upon whether you are running it under iis or cassini under the initial identity is the anonymous under the initial identity was protected void eventargs testthread new private void currentprincipal newprincipal if new private void windowsidentity tidentity windowsprincipal tprincipal new

 you pointed out its always important what the program should do if the file is in all my applications the user can always delete the config file and the application will create a new one with default no i also ship my applications without config users tend to delete files and even files they should not delete like serial keys and template i always check for these files because without them the application is unable to run at i can not create a new serial key from should happen when the file is you can do a file find or exception handler but the real question is what will happen when the file is or how important is the file for the i check all the time before i try to access any support files for the additional i do error handling if the file is corrupt and can not be

 you remove the access you remove any ability to call method from the function because it now defaults to no longer accessible to only remaining option is to fall back to the method inherited from as that is the only accessible if you were to call from within another b method you would get the b because members of b would see the private

 you store the dates as int then every application or tool that ever connects to your database has to know how to convert that int into something i would suggest sticking with the datatypes that fit the data unless your specific rdbms has serious flaws with a particular more issue to if you store them as int then you will also lose access to many functions and would have to write them for returning the day name of a particular

 you take approach you will have of the functionality working pretty your client will also think you are done and will wonder why it is taking you 9 times as long to finish the you take approach then i would call that nothing more than a prototype and treat it that to represent it as anything more than that will lead to nothing but problems later happy day scenarios are only of the the remaining is getting the other scenarios to work and the happy day scenario to work it is very hard to get to believe i usually do something between i attempt to do a fairly good job of identifying and all i then attempt to identify the most architecturally impacting scenarios and work on

 you there are many do most seem to read threads as os threads used by since you mentioned erlang in your like to post a more this kind of simulation with processes micro green as they are sometimes necessarily need any in we have a couple of likely thousands or hundreds of physics objects that need to be we want to simulate these objects as realistically as but there is probably also some kind of real time aspect involved have to be you mention this in your simple solution would be to spawn of an erlang process for each sent ticks to all of them and collect the results of the simulation before proceeding with the next this is in practice synchronizing it is of course more of a deterministic solution and does not guarantee any real time it is also how the processes would talk to each other to get the data they need for the you probably need to group them in clever ways groups have hibernated processes erlang has neat support for sleeping etc to speed things get real time properties you probably need to restrain the calculations performed by the processes accuracy for this could perhaps be done by sending out ticks waiting for and letting the object processes reply back to each tick with their current position and other data you need though it might only be approximated at the as this could lead to errors accumulating in the guess in one the question is really about if it is possible to use the strength of concurrency to gain some kind of advantage if you need it is a quite strong sign that you do not need concurrency between each physics because you essentially throw away a lot of computation time by waiting for other you might use concurrency during calculation but that is another i none of these ideas take the actual physics calculations into this is not erlang strong side and could perhaps be performed in a c library or whatever strikes your depending on the type of characteristics you i do not know of any case where this has been done not by so i cannot guarantee that this is sound	
 you there are various php implementations of but i know of any in since not a language typically applied to web going to depend on how complex of an implementation you want to come up very restrictive whitelist is probably the but if you want to be really comprehensive i would look into doing a conversion of one of the established versions to as opposed to trying to write your own from there are so many tricks to worry that i think be better off standing on the shoulders of others that have already gone through all know anything about using for web but converting php to it seem like it would be a particularly difficult php really have any magical capabilities that be able to sure there will be some small but overall if you want to go the route definitely still be faster to do a conversion than a full design from seems like a strong php implementation that is still actively comparison where the author discuss some differences between his approach and probably worth you come up definitely test it with all the examples you and make sure it passes all good

 your problem was that fancy error correction mechanism prevented you from knowing that there was a syntax error in the back in 1982 or running tex on a long document would take so much time that knuth want tex to just quit when it ran into an tex tries to guess what you meant and go on typesetting the so that you can fix a bunch of errors before you run it for when it spots a command outside math it assumes that you forgot a dollar sign and inserts no automatic mechanism is so syntax errors often cause some part of text to be or typeset in a wrong does try to tell you that it has found but i suppose current ides make it easy to ignore the try running latex on the document from the command line and pay attention to what it for the short seems i forgot some dollar tex to prompt you missing it seems i forgot some dollar 2009 way of dealing with this is to type x to fix the source and run latex again but you can actually enter other commands at the prompt to edit the input that tex if you just type q run quietly same as specifying which emacs or whatever ide you are using probably does for you get a typeset document as a and it might not be obvious that there are in fact syntax errors in
