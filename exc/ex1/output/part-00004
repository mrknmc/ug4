 a 25 element array of pointers to a pointer to char is generally considered a so this declaration could be interpreted as an array of but the memory for storing those strings does not exist you would have to allocate those string pointers are 4 bytes on your this line would have the effect of allocating 25 x 4 100 when you use an array name without a it into a pointer to the first element of the when this line is points to 100 bytes of enough room enough to hold 100 characters that are read in 99 characters plus a terminating nul the compiler is not protecting you from storing those characters in the memory that was allocated for 25 passing the starting address of the array to the function the compiler knows this is probably wrong since is supposed to take a pointer to not at pointer to an array of char but it lets you do it anyway except for the the statement in reinterprets that pointer as a char and you get the correct others have it would be correct to change the one line to declares an array of 25

 a common misconception that oo techniques be applied in most can just that they are slightly more unwieldy than in languages with syntax dedicated to the of the foundations of robust system design is the encapsulation of an implementation behind an and the functions that work with it is a good example of how encapsulation can be applied in c to establish since c lacks access specifiers you enforce that peeks inside a but only a masochist would do polymorphic behaviour can be had in c using tables of function the syntax is ugly but the effect is the same as virtual ianimal int int relying on guaranteed of memory layouts cat struct ianimal int struct x pa calls

 a current java project we have code similar to the following do nothing or but abort current do nothing or but abort current some more calls to different method do nothing or but abort current you can several different method are called with the exact same object and for every call the same exception is caught and handled the same in a very the exception is not but may only be logged and then only reason why there is a around every single is to always execute all of the no matter if a previously executed method like the above code at it takes up a lot of is very repetitive the logging done in the not presented and just looks can think of some other ways to write this but like them very the following options came to my sequence or daily i i try switch case case case catch do nothing or but abort current is obviously bad very and looks reflection to get objects for the methods to call and store them in a list in the order they are supposed to be then iterate over this list and call the method using as only the exception is handled inside of the like this as bugs example typos in the method only pop up during runtime and the reflection api is somewhat a functor class like class void throws create a list of objects that call the like functors new public void public void iterate this list and call on every can summarize my feeling about this approach with two code i really like all four i would like to discuss this problem what do you feel is the best how did you solve similar problems in the is there maybe a much simpler solution i missed to best execute a set of methods even if an exception

 a slightly different way to look at almost never makes sense when you are passing it as a pointer into a specific collection you are passing the collection as meyer was specifically stating that cannot be used with most member functions of a collection in that you will need a if you have a handle to the the only difference between the two is that you can modify what is by an and you modify the object referenced by a you want to use whenever you are passing a collection and position into the collection to an signatures make a whole lot of the implicit statement is that is free to modify the underlying collection but is not allowed to modify what that make much if you really want then should be an offset instead of an the flip most of the algorithms in the stl are based on ranges specified by a pair of the collection itself is never passed so the difference between and is whether the value in the collection can be modified through the iterator or without a reference to the the separation is pretty that made things as clear as mud

 accepted answer is a little you use the returned by that can be anywhere in your assuming you can see the variable which has pointer returned by is equally true of any memory allocated in c or whether stack or just put in front of a local and you now have the key that allows any other part of the program to get at the storage for that and use it just as effectively as if they could see the variable name variable names are only visible inside the scope they are declared but their storage is accessible from in any assuming the address has been taken and passed and yet frequently to take the address of local variables in and so it is unfortunately impossible to use those languages effectively without understanding

 actually working on an extensibility framework to use on top of my extensibility framework is based on the famous ioc structuremap use case trying to fulfill is create an application that should have some basic functionality that can be extended for every customer there should only be one instance of the application hosted but this instance can be adapted for every customer without making any changes to the core was inspired by the article on multi tenacy written by ayende source of inspiration was the book of eric evans on domain driven my extensibility framework is based on the repository pattern and the concept of root to be able to use the framework the hosting application should be build around repositories and domain the repositories or domain objects are bind at runtime by the is simply an asselmbly that contains controllers or repositories or domain objects that respects a specific naming the naming convention is every class should be prefixed by the customerid extend an application you copy a assembly in the extension folder of the when a user request a page under the customer root folder framework check if there is a for that particular customer and instantiate the custom classes otherwise it loads the default the custom classes can be controllers repositories or domain this approach enables to extend an application at all from the database to the through the domain you want to extend some existing features you create a an assembly that contains subclasses of the core when to create totally new functionalities you add new controllers inside the these controllers will be loaded by the mvc framework when the corresponding url is if you want to extend the ui you can create a new view inside the extension folder and reference the view by a new or subclassed controller modify existing behavior you can create new repositories or domain objects or sub classing exiting the framework responsibility is to determine which repository domain object should be loaded for a specific advise to have a look at structuremap and especially at the registry dsl features is the code i use at the startup of the application to register all or domain void also use an extensionfactory inheriting from the this factory is responsible to load the extension objects or domain you can plugin your own factories by registering them at startup in the void new framework as a fully operational sample site can be found

 added the following code to a copy of questions page existing scripts and running from scratch with one of the uncommented each time three runs of 100 var new for return new var are the results running on a virtualbox on a core 2 is much faster than copying of course it was always going to serialising a dom to text and then it from html is hard the reason dom child operations are usually slow is that them dom operations like clonenode have to do manages to do the innerhtml op amazingly but still not nearly as quickly as it does ie as a auto all round to everyone who said innerhtml would obviously be faster without considering what the question was actually jquery uses innerhtml to not because faster the ie copies events bound via attachevent using calling detachevent on clone will also remove the events from the in order to get around we use uses to implement its own event so naturally it needs to avoid that if you need you can avoid the then i think holding jquery up as the pinnacle of best practice may be a bit especially given the next adds its own arbitrary attributes to html and then needs to get rid of them when it clones them otherwise gives access to their such as through the this is ugly but then it thinks the best way to do that is processing html using regular which is the kind of basic mistake expect more from so questioners than the author of the second coming best js framework you have the string anywhere in your text if so you just mysteriously lost thanks thus ends the	
 added to the dict argument in so that the compiler warns me if i try to change the address dict is pointing that case you meant not dict declared the struct as not the pointer to do i also need to have const for otherwise you could use currptr to modify the dictionary struct which is supposed to be const in this line currptr is changing the currptr why the compile warn me about that if i added a const to not an error if the const is in the place you put it would be if the const were in the other place for i be able to access the dictionary in the main program cause i lost the address i was pointing when the main program calls it passes a pointer value into the and this becomes the value of dict in the get but get has its own pointer separate from the one in the main even if they just so happen to both be called changing one pointer change the variables point to the same so if you use the variable to modify any of the fields in the then of course the results will affect both bits of a function called would be a so right to make the parameter dict but i think the reason this is is slightly different from what you to protect the contents of the dictionary from not to protect your record of the address of is slightly awkward for linked lists like this even when you have a const its field still point to so although you modify the first the protect you from modifying other nodes in the addresses this with function so you can have a function which returns a const output if the input is but a output if the input is you could achieve a similar thing in c with a and the latter having a const parameter and but most people including standard library functions like which in c takes const but returns strchr can therefore be accidentally used in c to convert a const string into a without any or in which case a bit like laundering money through a business function does not require me to add a const before currptr and confess stumped on i would expect the same warning as in are you sure it but the parameter to del be const because potentially modifying the

 address the question posed by your most recent is the current but the time the start of the current psycopg2 is probably starting a transaction implicitly for and since the transaction is never closed a commit or the timestamp gets and becomes frequently if only doing up psycopg2 to use different behavior for automatically creating transactions tricky to get and affect other parts of your a different timestamp like but otherwise perfect for this section emphasis provides a number functions that return values to the current date and functions all values based on the start time of current and deliver values with time and deliver values without time and optionally be given a which causes the result be rounded to that many digits in the seconds without precision the result given to the full available functions return start time of the current their values do not change during this is considered the intent is to allow single transaction to have consistent notion of the so that multiple within the same transaction bear same time other database systems might advance these values more also provides that return the start time of current as well as actual current time at the instant function is the complete of time functions is a traditional equivalent to is equivalent to is named to clearly reflect what returns the start time of the statement the of receipt of the latest message from the return same value during the first command a but might differ subsequent returns the current and therefore its changes even within a single is a postgresql it returns actual current but as formatted text string rather than timestamp with time zone

 advise is not to mess about with any manual modifications through do things the by placing the modifications in the directory described in sharepoint	
 afraid the rendering code for the repeatinfo is used to render the explicitly writes a line break when a layout it set to horizontal flow and an item is on a column boundary or the last in the here that part of void irepeatinfouser style webcontrol if repeatcolumns itemindex repeateditemcount if else if if indexincolumn suppose you could try to inject the drop down list into a control collection when an item is created or but then have to know that it a last this requires knowing total count before you do the data	
 after i create a release but when we have some time before we i sometimes open the entire branch for edit and then lock all files in order to prevent anybody from modifying anything during period in the release there a better doing it my current way seems possibly like an incorrect use of the lock is there a better way to keep somebody from checking in code without using i though of p4 protect but i am not the admin on this perforce and also dealing with the protect file at potentially 100s of lines would get cumbersome as a branch in

 agree except in two ssl using jsse is noticeably there are native versions that can be plugged but that tends to be more in general the ssl is a bit less straightforward than the apache httpd with an httpd server gives more flexibility re virtual web hosts tomcat is not as flexible in this unsurprisingly it lacks all the options in apache an obvious nice one is built in compression of static files is very easy to add in not hard in tomcat but more are apache httpd server is a totally different beast and has no code shared with neither is an than yeah use tomcat by

 agree the first lacks readability as long as it is used iow b and c are simple expressions this operator does get abused though in circumstances it ought the second using the result foo as anything other than a boolean would not be using the boolean operators to return values because thats the way they work is just however as a boolean expression its

 agree with i find it hard to believe that you really want to continue execution of something after an exception has been if you then something exceptional probably has not actually another exceptions should not be used for logging or flow they should only be used when something exceptional has happened that the code at the level where the exception was thrown cannot deal i would internalize the logging messages and remove the exceptions that are being a i think you need to go back and what the code is trying to do and what business value or rules are being as peterr try to understand did we get here in the first part of the code and what exactly the exceptions	
 agree with idrosid answer of just loading the pairs into memory and then streaming over the if truly got a lot of data of and you have the machine resources to do this as fast as new elastic hadoop service would be a good once got a simple executable working for small it would be pretty to scale that up to tons of data using map reduce

 agree with pop it is probably best not to block in those command i think you could improve your game by thinking about the design a bit let me provide some thoughts for you on how you could possibly improve your it sounds like the problem you are describing is that you want to send a lot of move in a certain to a game component and have it execute those commands in that certain as you have there is a difference in the time it takes the computer to perform the calculations the velocity or and the time it takes the component to actually perform the action or problem with blocking during the calculations is that the update loop that is calling that function cannot update any other that may work okay if there is only one component to worry but not usually the case in most for the good how do we fix this i think erikkallen has the right but i would take it a bit it sounds like the game component is some kind of entity that will be moving so why not give it an action a simple implementation would be to just have your calling function call something queueaction function might look like void the top of your update function you could nocurrentaction need to add a line at the end of the update function nocurrentaction i definitely call this the best but it take much code to implement of course if you need to move and rotate at the same time have to tweak it a it will also get messier when you add different types of a more general i would think about making a base action and deriving specific action classes from then you could just push actions to the and your update function could call the update which would do the work the two sections of your game components update function is doing are just some ideas to think i hope something here will get you last thing i wanted to mention was that i see you using gametime variable that is passed to the amount your component moves and rotates may need to be a function of the elapsed time since update was last meaning that the update function would move and rotate your game component based on the amount of time that has not just how many times the update function was not very good at explaining and it depends on how like your game to here are a different from shawn hargreaves an xna forum discussing the point i was trying to

 align is only supposed to apply to elements i think images are the only things that have this layout property by so to use it to position an inline first turn it into an inline then you can use margin and padding to position it similar to how you woudl a normal block 1em 0 1px em 2px 0 0 have to it a little for firefox but this is because of a raer example of firefox not supporting web on the other hand you could not bother with the tweak as few people still use and only a very minor design

 all depends on your hash implementation of hashes some change their size to an other arbitrary size the next prime hashes will need a rehash after changing their buffer which is moving pointers but is still linear with the hash some hashes use consistent which reduces the need to move elements around only one small fraction of the elements will need to be	
 all depends very much on the specific framework you want to broad web frameworks tend to fall into two jsp jsp spring your legacy application is it would make sense to port your application also to reducing the amount of new concepts that you your need to learn reducing the amount of code you will need to of all possible i would recommend to for view layer similar to your existing approach of using for layer quite similar to but solves quite many common issues also use with these two frameworks well with is a small example of this

 allow for rounding errors when comparing floating point rather than testing for something like this is usually what you epsilon is some suitably small like are several reasons why floating point math not all values can be represented exactly for can not be represented in binary floating point in the same way that be represented in is that floating point only uses a fixed number of significant digits relative to the decimal hence the so on large small fractions effectively get truncated never assume that floating point computations return an accurate

 almost as if is blocking indefinitely in the driver somewhere because the stick is no longer will ultimately emit a file system irp and not using so that irp will be but it looks like where the actual file system has abruptly disappeared from underneath the file system that irp is never which means stuffed the function call which lead to the file system irp being issued will never using that will prolly get you around this at least from the point of view of not you will still be experiencing resource loss and the since the irp will still be passed down and almost certainly still be coming back but at least you be blocking on for quick is i would say designed to reduce the amount of caching that goes on and perhaps influence the order of writes to the file system to reduce the chance of i extremely doubt it is intended to preserve the file system in the event of file system departure a should not be surprised that this kills the file

 alternate approach to the visual comments there is a scheme system and associated book that has been targeted particularly at people like you with some the book to design is available free on the web and printed and the system is open upside of this sort of approach is that it is a nice clean small design with some powerful tools to get you plus a vastly better textual approach that your typical yourself x in y technical downside is that be starting off in a language that while very nicely designed is not and has a different approach that the family and related languages that dominate industry programming so while be learning with a much nicer language you have so many sources of you follow this track probably become a better programmer but be a bit when you do learn a more mainstream language or you make many of the same newbie mistakes as guess it depends a lot what your long and goals	
 alternative to representing the digits as a sequence of integers is to represent the number base as a list of 32 bit which is what many big integer libraries you then have to convert the number to base 10 for this gain you very much for this particular problem you can write straight then have to divide by 10 many times instead of multiplying 2 by itself 1000 times as 1000 is calculating the product of using repeated squaring which requires more space and a multiplication but is far fewer operations is closer to normal big integer so you may find it more useful in later problems if you try to calculate the last ten digits of using the int method and repeated it may take some time in that case you could use modulo rather than adding strings of millions of

 always stick with and i always seed the sequence high enough so that they will all have a consistent number of digits seems to be less also sometimes start an order say 6 starting at and customer numbers at 5 starting at which would for example give me unique customer numbers and unique order numbers to and you could always tell just by looking at it whether it was a customer number or an order so if a customer rep was asking for a number over the phone it would immediately be obvious which was would not however build logic in the app that would depend on so even if it did roll the system

 am by know means a hosting guru and i imagine there are ways and means of doing this but my personal opinion is that what you are talking about doing is defiantly an unnecessary security if this site is to be available on the internet it will have public access then you probably want to disable anonymous access in remember that the idea of being able to configure the anonymous access for a site in iis is so that you can create a user which has specific permission to read the relevant files for a particular what we are talking about here is file access on a physical for one thing a public web server should be in a dmz and not part of your companies domain so users should not be able to log in with their domain credentials only reason why i could imagine that you would want to switch off anonymous access and force users to input their windows credentials is for a site which will only be used internally and even then i would probably not choose to restrict access in this you want to restrict access to content on a public website then you would probably be better of writing something which handles authentication as part of the site itself or a service which the site can then if someone were to obtain user credentials then at least all they will be able to do is gain access to the site and there is no potential for a breach of your internal network by any is a reason why developers spend allot of time writing user management you will find plenty of advice on how to write something like this and plenty of libraries that will do most of the work for	
 am calling devenv from nant and normally all is however we occasionally have the issue where a developer has added a new project and has checked in the solution file but forgotton to add the new project to source not sure but it this situation visual studio puts up a dialog with an ok button saying that it cannot find the project trouble this is on a headless build server that nobody is watching and the only thing we notice is that the build will would prefer it if devenv then exited with a nant could pick that up and would fail the build which is the correct there a way of stopping visual studio from doing or as an alternative are there any good validators avaiable i could run before launching devenv to check that there is a good chance that it fall over with a silly resaon why i am calling devenv is that i need to build deployment projects and the only way to do this to is to use turns out that my build script was explicitly calling that is the gui form of visual the resolution was to remove the part of the call leaving the command processing to favour the over the the version display the dialog it bombs out on the command line instead which is the behaviour i can i stop visual studio 2008 from displaying a dialog if projects are

 am posting this as an answer so i can explain how i did it and the answer from mitch wheat was the one that gave me the best solution for this case and i just had to modify it slightly due to the format this data was exported is the vb fixedcontents as string addressof regex that was used is what i needed to change because certain fields had quotes in them and the regex provided seem to work on all this one uses and to see if the quote is just after a comma or just in this they are both negative show me where the double quote is not before or after a this should mean that the quote is in the middle of a this instead of doing a direct i am using the function replacequotes to handle that for the reason i am using this is because i needed a little extra logic to detect whether it was at the beginning of a if i would have spent even more time on i am sure i could have tweaked the regex to take into consideration the beginning of the line but when i tried it it seem to work at this in using csv reader on a 32mb csv file 19000 it takes about 2 seconds to read the perform the load it into the csv add all the data to my generic class and real

 am working on a few php projects that use mvc and while they all have different ways of retrieving objects from the it always seems that nothing beats writing your sql queries by hand as far as speed and cutting down on the number of one of my web projects by a junior executes over 100 queries just to load the home the reason is that in one a method will load an but later on deeper in the it will load some other that are related to the first leads to the other part of the question which is what are people doing in situations where you have a table that in one part of the code only needs the values for a few and another part needs something right now the same there is one method for each and it does a lists all the columns in the table so that anytime you need the object for any you get the whole in other you hear all the talk about how select is but if you try to use a orm class that comes with the it wants to do just that are you stuck to choosing orm with select vs writing the specific sql queries by it just seems to me that stuck between convenience and and if i hand write the if i add a most likely going to have to add it to several places in the for the long but explaining the background to get some mindsets from other developers rather than maybe a specific i know that we can always use something like but i would rather optimize what we can before getting into for any is a good balance in an mvc model to have efficient data

 amidst your foundation basic layout rules for modules as well as complex layout rules for modules modules like or rules almost no all color combined all type combined reusability styling has less separation also allows mobile and print versions for the layout all controlled by via the stylesheet i link to the am using this for a for extra i keep each sheet sectioned basically the same i also tag my selectors and as well as indent them in order of dependency inside the same selector so i know what rules i am referencing or this framework allows nearly infinite expansion while keeping things and had to refactor a line file a month so this is a new system i am trying found that css as scalable and easy to understand as a since what css is used for another method which might be more relevant is to just use a good css text positive vs is crap for working with unless you happen upon some if on give text a a textmate windows port and has bundles designed for css and markup that give you much better syntax highlighting and what you then can do is even a into collapsible start module 1 end module 1 use the symbol list to display for you a quick toc on the fly with a query like or it also indexes lines with these types of comments for tagging and all css selector you should have no trouble working with single big files with unless progressively enhancing your css all going to get minified i would also make sure to indent your css to somewhat mimic the structure of dom section it is referring i agree with the base css and 1 though it entirely depends on your business

 an alternative to andrew use for compilations and for compilations on ppc or sparc or intel machines since you actually mention which chip architecture you are using and that notation works on all of often ensure a compilation more to ensure cc an environment variable used by though in this it is also recognized by which is a shell script generated by the notation i used which is what i use at the command line sets cc in the environment while the command is the other answer suggests assume that works and achieves much the same not tried it so i know that it you run you will see information just standard about how to use the and at the it will list of relevant environment of which cc is advantage of setting the c compiler to is that the flag is set every time the compiler is used there is very little room for it to go if you set a flags variable there is a chance that some command use and then things can go going back to the certainly uses a variable called and you can set that on the make command overrides any setting in the by using an environment the setting in the makefile overrides the value in the so setting cc as an environment variable is less although gives the environment precedence over the it is usually a dangerous option to use it can have unexpected	
 an alternative was faced with the exact same problem at work i wasted a good week in trying to figure the best way to do i ended up with creating a join as you have but the table contains only instead of keeping track of status quo is has read all their the unread messages their should be as fast as status quo should be the least straining status on the if i kept track of all the messages everyone has the clutter in the database grows pretty rapidly easily leading to thousands of rows of in even smaller this problem is exaggerated if the lifetime of messages are indefinite you could be keeping track of message statuses that are many years keeping track of the your table contains only a handful of and they diminish for each message that a user getting the amount of unread messages is as simple as from unread where user this is a while reading is pretty much as fast as computationally writing is a for each written you need to insert an entry to this join if multiple people can read the same you need to insert one row for each if the recipients are implicit only a user name is or even with the criteria such as who has access to this creating new messages becomes even more i feel this is a fair

 answer is because it provides a way to launch custom then generate build but not very because you then lose all possibilities to use build in which you can to always compile files with some precise skip custom build for a particular file in a particular project configuration visualize this is no way at least i have found to it the only way i have found is to have the custom build tool return a number when files have been with a message to the user explaining that it is an error and inviting him to launch build the next custom build tool is launched again but the tool i use is pretty but modifies no new and build process goes using valid the approach described above does not work with which seems to ignore project build

 answer is long answer is that the bathtub distribution a very good because of the lack of continuity in the way failures say for example that an input value of 42 causes a then the distribution of those failures will be exactly the distribution of 42 values in the not like as you software fail over it fails when it may be that misusing the words you my mean a rather than a a is one occurrence of incorrect a is a flaw in the a appearance of defects in software tends to have a but it really anywhere near as clean as your bugs tend to be observed early and taper then spike on patches and new with a general upward trend starting farther into the life of the even that takes careful as you really are talking about defects observed per unit having said modern se practices tend to change the actual rates but not the distribution of observed defects over here is worth a little definition the space shuttle hal software have very low defect using se techniques that were 20 years strong structured rigorous review and ocd version control and extreme programming tends to have low but many of the things more traditional methods would call xp calls since no finite and rigorous definition of what it a is just another have been decent studies to show that do result in low defect but be very surprised if the time distribution is a different

 answer was very but i was surprised to see that it end with you should ask yourself why you are populating a combo box with duplicate the framework bug no doubt has been allowed to exist because when you use the control as to allow the user to pick an item from a you run into this is the user going to differentiate between the identical why would they choose one over is there a different meaning to the different if then having duplicate entries is which is always bad usability if then you have duplicate only scenario i can think of where this might make sense is when you have a large list consisting of several groups of related where one or more items logically fits into more than one group so you want to display it in both guessing your design account for the fact that there may be multiple identical entries and that this omission will have other usability repercussions that are more significant than this of i understand that you may be doing something i thought of where it totally makes sense to do what in which case you can feel free to ignore my	
 answer works fine if running framework not everyone answer is to use comparison of various ways to do this including dynamicmethods and various other tricks was discussed on an earlier	
 answer your first is performing the convolution of a with the reverse of v and giving the results clipped by the specified because of the of the correlation sum for i inf of where t even though this definition of the correlation would allow for results from to you obviously store an infinitely long so it has to be and that is where the mode comes there are 3 different mode returns results for every t where both a and v have some mode returns a result with the same length as the shortest vector or mode returns results only when a and v completely overlap each the documentation for gives more detail on the your second i think giving you the it is just giving you a little more as the autocorrelation is used to find how similar a or is to itself at a certain time at a time difference of the should be the highest because the signal is identical to so you expected that the first element in the result array would be the the correlation is not starting at a time difference of it starts at a negative time closes to and then goes that you were sum for i inf where 0 t what you got sum for i inf where t you need to do is take the last half of your correlation and that should be the you are looking a simple python function to do that would result return of need error checking to make sure that x is actually a this explanation probably the most mathematically been throwing around infinities because the definition of convolution uses but that necessarily apply for the theoretical portion of this explanation may be slightly but hopefully the practical results are on are pretty and can give you a much better theoretical background if you mind wading through the notation and heavy

 answer your in my current i use common methods to do something like top print bottom print all the individual to my to my feeling you could and to do this but i i think be too much fiddling around for a fairly minor how do it if i had to do it all rely more on some sort of middle layer such as which would allow me to move up quickly to or back to or even write my application from the to use more ajax that most of my are carried out by really small perl scripts which just process the input and respond back to the javascript application in or	
 answer your question as to what is actually going i try to foreach an questions block i get an object not collection each enumerates a set of variants from the source it does this by acquiring an if the source variable holds an object it is expected to have an implementation of this if it is an array vbscript creates an implementation dynamically and it can only do this if the array has been anything else in the source variable as empty in this will result in an the assignment fails with a type mismatch left hand side of an assignment operation must always be a hence its not possible copy the contents of one dynamic array to another via a simple first approach is reasonably sound but you need a way to represent an empty array without crashing out a for you can use this little public public public private sub questions end if you try to for each the questions before it has been assigned a real array the for each will do nothing as also if you use 1 to get the count of questions that will still be accurate since is	
 answer your question but it might be easier to use an int32 property in your class and and use a static class of constants like this to handle the values in static class public const int cancomment public const int canedit public const int candelete public const int canremoveusers public const int all cancomment canedit candelete know this is not since it restrict your users to the fixed enum and forces you to deal with raw ints in but i think hibernate will have trouble with a bitwise it will try to map a value in the database back to a specific enum if it finds a value in the database which you have not explicitly enumerated it will probably if it finds a in the it be able to map it back to an enum unless you explicitly enumerate every like this probably defeats the purpose of using the bitwise

 answers you got so far are i think however that you are mixing things in your question that belong so not possible to completely answer your question title states settings db these can be two quite different you have to differentiate between files that are files that are common for all users but and common files that every user should be able to work first category is use a suitable directory under one of the or second category is also files just need to be installed in the proper location by the setup which must be run with proper because standard users will not be able to write to the correct last category however is because there simply a directory in all windows installations that can be assumed to be writeable for all especially in business settings with user accounts it can be that the user has no write permissions for the local disc at only to their user directory somewhere on a server in the so there is no single simple way to grab that data location for your program and be sure it will work something you will possibly have to revisit for all programs and all use cases bonus points you should also always consider whether the files should go into the roaming profile and be available on all machines in a or whether they are tip i would give is to move away from desktop style database files like paradox or access files for applications that need to share data between users on a only with real database servers will you be able to have data on accounts	
 anton if you put the extension methods directly on it would probably nothing particularly but the idea would be that you have a class that you create instances instead you just have purely static building static class public static return x public static return x public static this return returns equivalent of two functions and play the role of your and presumably have similar ones for primitive comparisons and so and then operators like would let you plug two expressions then you lose the ability to use operator which you could have used with your wrapper and instead you have to use method been playing around with the same kind of and the thing i always come back to is that i want to be able to define extension the team apparently considered these for with extension but they were lower priority because they play a part in the overall aims of

 application i am working on is suffering from a slow memory i have used cdb with sos to try to determine what is happening but the data does not seem to make any sense so i was hoping one of you may have experienced this application is running on the 64 bit it is continuously calculating and serialising data to a remote host and is hitting the large object heap a fair most of the loh objects i expect to be once the calculation is complete and has been sent to the remote the memory should be what i am is a large number of object arrays interleaved with free blocks of taking a random segment from the 000000005b5b1000 address mt 0000064280c7c970 00000000001661d0 1901752 00000642788d8ba8 1056 00000000001661d0 5988848 00000642788d8ba8 00000000001661d0 6481336 00000642788d8ba8 00000000001661d0 7346016 00000642788d8ba8 00000000001661d0 7611648 00000642788d8ba8 00000000001661d0 264808 i would expect this to be the case if my application were creating large objects during each does do this and i accept there will be a degree of loh fragmentation but that is not the problem the problem is the very small object arrays you can see in the above dump which i cannot see in code being created and which are remaining rooted note that cdb is not reporting the type when the heap segment is i am not sure if this is related or if i dump the marked reports it rank number of elements type elements of the object array are all strings and the strings are recognisable as from our application i am unable to find their gc roots as the command hangs and never comes back have even tried leaving it i would very much appreciate it if anyone could shed any light as to why these small object arrays are ending up on the what situations will put a small object array in does anyone happen to know of an alternative way of ascertaining the roots of these in theory i came up with late yesterday is that these object arrays started out large but have been shrunk leaving the blocks of free memory that are evident in the memory what makes me suspicious is that the object arrays always appear to be 1056 bytes long 128 8 for the references and 32 bytes of idea is that perhaps some unsafe code in a library or in the clr is corrupting the number of elements field in the array bit of a long shot i to brian rasmussen accepted the problem has been identified as fragmentation of the loh caused by the string intern i wrote a quick test application to confirm void const int iterations for index index string str for index index string str application first creates and dereferences unique strings in a this is just to prove that the memory does not leak in this obviously it should not and it does the second unique strings are created and this action roots them in the intern what i did not realise is how the intern table is it appears it consists of a set of pages object arrays of 128 string elements that are created in the this is more evident in sos of gc 0 starts at 1 starts at 2 starts at segment allocation segment begin allocated 00b21000 010029bc object heap starts at segment begin allocated 01b21000 01b8ade0 size heap size a dump of the loh segment reveals the pattern i saw in the leaking 01b21000 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 free total 1568 mt count totalsize class 784 12544 784 421088 1568 that the object array size is 528 than because my workstation is 32 bit and the application server is 64 the object arrays are still 128 elements the moral to this story is to be very careful if the string you are interning is not known to be a member of a finite set then your application will leak due to fragmentation of the at least in version 2 of the our there is general code in the deserialisation code path that interns entity identifiers during i now strongly suspect this is the the intentions were obviously good as they wanted to make sure that if the same entity is deserialised multiple times then only one instance of the identifier string will be maintained in object heap	
 application is database each row contains the main content column i display in a most of the rows content have a reference to image1 and some to i convert these to base64 and add the image string into the if either image it means i have to go back through all the rows and update the base64 can provide a unique string in the row content such as it means have to search through the entire content for that row and replace with the base64 version of the these images are also always at the bottom of the row not sure how having to go through all content first before replacing will affect is there a better way to do way to reference image through out

 approach to work around this is to use the scriptignore attribute and create a partial class for the object in up the entitystate properties and adding a scriptignore attribute to partial class public new entitykey public new entitystate the person class is serialized via it will ignore those this would not be practical because ef uses the state info to keep track of objects and this would wreak there were a way to dynamically add it would eliminate the need to override those properties just to add a since there is no way to dynamically add this solution may not be that

 approach you are referring to is viewmodel its where you have multiple complex view parts that need to bind to their own viewmodel the approach entails constructing a root viewmodel with properties for each child then the root view is bound to the root view model and each view displayed or is bound to the corresponding property on the root viewmodel would look like class rootviewmodel childviewmodela childa childviewmodelb childb view would look like could also implement this in away to allow yourself to select an active viewmodel would look like class rootviewmodel public childworkspaces public viewmodel activeworkspace public view would look like will result in the appropriate visual representation being selected implicity based on the type of the actual object stored in my response was in i tried my hardest to not get caught up in the syntax of it all you can see the plurality of can be often times we find the need to construct multiple to structure the viewmodel but all viewmodel entities would be somewhere within the root view model implementing mvvm in i prefer to infer what visual element to apply data context implicitly illustrated in the later half of this in more complex scenarios i prefer to use a datatemplateselector to conduct that but in super simple cases you can explicitly apply datacontext either imperatively in or declaratively through this

 are a and you should avoid them being if if you are implemented you will almost always want to write one conjunction with a that calls and you implement a then unless any idisposable instances that you are holding implement finalizers you will say for example that safehandle have a finalizer but relied on someone calling if you held and implement a then allowing your consumer to permanently leak the handle by not calling dispose on that both your consumer and objects that you consume will play nice a reason not to play nice even if you use a you should dispose of it as if it were managed otherwise if you dispose of it at all then it will have to wait until gc to be and if you do dispose of it in dispose but no a and no one disposes of then it will have to wait until the gc after the one that collected above has the right not and by adding you avoid the gc except in cases where no on disposed of you for adding a boolean to track if been disposed of i prefer to just write my dispose methods to be for also helps to do it that way when an object may acquire resources during use and you only want to dispose the ones it

 are a lot of comments arguing the pros and cons of mvvm for i agree with a matter of using the pattern appropriately and mvvm always people seems to have become willing to sacrifice all of the most important principles of software design just to get it to fit think your case could be a good fit with a bit of most cases come wpf enables you to get by without multiple maybe you could try using and instead of windows with your case my suggestion would be have handle the and if the login is set a property on to an appropriate value or some enum value like do the same for a successful login or some other enum then use a which responds to the various user authentication states and could use a simple to change the property of the your login window return a i think is where getting that is really a property of your in admittedly limited experience with when something feel right it usually because thinking in terms of how i done the same thing in that

 are a thousand mp3 players for using the native streaming unfortunately that copes generally poorly with streamed mp3 over icecast or even more so under shoutcast generally the player has to reconnect to the stream every so causing a playback otherwise memory just fills with mp3 is no native but in flash 10 you can play any old samples you can decode so possible to implement your own ogg it needs a lot of cpu on the client see know of anyone having fixed this up into a single player that can do both mp3 and ogg from the same interface but no reason it be

 are currently implementing the full recovery model from the sound of this will allow you to restore to a point in time provided that you have a transaction log backup that covers the desired point in time full order to reduce the size of your required transaction log you should look to increase the frequency of your transaction log i would suggest once you have gauged the actual usage of your log you can then look to shrink it to a more suitable the key point to note here is that once a transaction log backup has been the inactive portion of the log file becomes available for use once the reason why a transaction log file grows continuously is if the transaction log backups are not being taken at all or their frequency is not would also suggest that you consider performing a mix of differential and full backups in order to reduce the collective size of your backed up an example schedule would be a weekly full say every with daily differential hope what i have detailed makes please feel free to contact me directly and i will happily assist you in deploying an appropriate backup strategy for your to stop the transaction from growing and restoring databases sql

 are developing a skinned app with various rounded edges on most of its i am using window regions to define but nearly everyone objects to the jagged aliasing this because pixels can only be either fully opaque or fully come up with a solution to this using layered but we want to make sure this will run hopefully run on a variety of and i want to see if anyone has any better or ways to optimize what i know layered windows requires win2000 or and that is as that is already a requirement for other from some basic tests it looks ok on but no guarantee what i i have a call it with controls and text and whatever comprises that i have window b as a child of window except it has the style instead of so it can position itself outside region and is drawn on top of window b also has the and on i call with the flag and a source dc with a 32bit bitmap with an alpha to get it to draw with bitmap used in the source dc for window b is pretty much just the pixels around the border of the window that i want to blend smoothly from the background into full i would skip the whole two window approach and just use a single layered except that when using it is drawn from a buffer kept in in lieu of the typical messages and all and trying to get interactive child controls child to work well with that sounds like a remarkable hassle probably even work for basically window a with all the child controls and with window b floating directly on top of drawing a nice smooth i respond to messages and so on by moving window b along with and i have window b disabled so it can never get focus or input already go since parts of it that are of zero such as the majority of its inner already are excluded from what the pieces look to show what i mean a little with cyan used to mask fully transparent with an alpha channel pictured of a that would blend the pixels into it but i be certain really the best way to do i have two this sound or is there anything glaringly terrible about it currently it seems like using an buffer the size of the window can be up to even though very few pixels of it have any opacity data would it be worth the overhead and additional complexity of cutting it up into separate border pieces and compositing them layered windows to create smooth window

 are quite a bit of different arguments given i want to start by making clear that you cannot really make a each has its pros and and any code snippet will be more appropriate for one or the other that is as much to on the that you must know whether you have gc or not to write efficient argument is must know your environment and code that will make your code moving from one paradigm to the other and coding the same style will make your code more inefficient than what the gc really program makes thousands of heap memory allocations for short lived that it allocates and deallocates many with different size of a for each allocation you would end up calling and that requires locating in the list of free memory fragments the most suitable one to the specific malloc the memory is used and then it is freed with free in the cost of memory management is the cost of locating the a gc with a movable gc as java or after each gc run all free memory is the cost of acquiring memory for an object is really cheap cpu instructions in java at each gc only alive objects are located and moved to the beginning of the appropriate memory region it is a different region than the original the cost of memory management is primarily the cost of moving all reachable the premise is that most objects are shortlived so at the end the cost may be smaller than that of a one million objects allocated and freed on a single gc run amount to no extra in gc languages you can create all local objects on the they are on the other in a bunch of deallocations and new allocations is the memory is fragmented and the cost of malloc in systems you should use the stack as much as using the heap out of has another people used to one of the two memory systems will tend to write inefficient programs in the they are used to some idioms that are probably bad on the other clear example is a programmer that is used to allocate an object and reuse its internal pointers with new elements as is used to that way of allocation is reusing is if the same exact code is moved to a generational gc environment both are you get a funny in java generational gc the system will perform minor collections only on the younger only processing older generations in full but an object in the young generation could be referred to by objects in the older so extra work has to be performed to keep track of this in particular in garbage the system will mark the of where the old object resides and it then includes all the marked cards for processing during the minor effectively increasing the amount of work that the gc has to perform and possibly impacting object was alive during gc and it was moved that many times finally is moved to the old generation where it will not be moved in each gc run but can just stand but the programmer forces the object to become a it is moved once and it will again be moved each time the gc runs up to the time where it becomes old make a sensible you would need to get to programmers that know the environment write pieces of code that solve the same problem with the same algorithms with different mind sets about memory then compare the results of both of

 are several ways to do you can use bar passes a reference to the function thereby allowing the function to modify the object in the calling while this is not technically a value it is a way to have a function do something in the code above the function would return an and modify similar approach is to use an an parameter is identical to a parameter with an compiler enforced this rule is that if you pass an parameter into a that function is required to set its value prior to besides that an parameter works just like a final approach the best in most is to create a type that encapsulates both values and allow the function to return foobar public int i public bar b final approach is simpler and easier to read and	
 are smart to be thinking of designing a data layer in your in an application this will help you standardize and pretty dramatically simplify your data you need to learn how to create and use objectdatasources but this is quite other advantage of a data access layer using a separate is that it makes unit testing much also encourage you to build a business layer to do much of the processing of data business for would be responsible for pulling objectdatasources from the dal to hand to the ui not only does this let you encapsulate your business it improves the testability of the code as do want to be caching datasets dal for that in the you will build a web app so that record modifications work through a unique id other primary key and feed changes directly to the dal as they are if you were to cache everything you would reduce the scalability of your others on this thread are promoting the idea of using i would be careful about adopting a orm for reasons that i have previously outlined and i that it would be wise to avoid in my own i make extensive use of datareaders to fill my objectdatasources is trivial due to the design of my and find it to be very

 avoid the problems you mention with the static pages you could take a few different the dynamic category pages in a separate path the static pages in a separate path now you have a category called but all other ones would the static routes above the dynamic not ideal since it could potentially hide category pages if you name your categories but even if you did or you would still want to do this as a also need to ensure that your category names and page names are on a large site this is not always trivial even which is probably why you see urls like the ones here on stack overflow where the question id is actually in the and the part is just seo need to have a strategy for handling name if a category name or page name is need to have something in place to redirect links to the old names to the new ones for maximum seo also want to make sure that the new name of a the same as the old name of another which adds a bit more complexity to the that it is and it it certainly worthwhile in my especially if you expect most of your traffic to come from search

 background i have a concurrent map i used to cache some values that change quite often worth caching them from i want to evict items from my cache at regular intervals by examining an expire time in the i am using the method to get a reference to all my keys and then check the values and if expired i remove in other threads the cache is being queried and the javadocs for it mentioned if the map changes while i am iterating over the keyset set the results are obviously i would like a defined way of dealing with this so the results are would it be enough to pass the set to a hashset and then iterate over this set as it is my understanding this set will not be backed by the is this a wasteful of memory way of doing any ideas my evictor is not the only way for items to be removed from the concurrent map so am i correct in saying that i need to copy the keyset to another set before iterating through in it turns out i was reading the javadocs for the map method instead of the concurrentmap thanks my bad a set view of the contained in this the set backed by the so changes to map are reflected in the if the map is while an iteration over the set is progress through own remove results of the iteration the set supports which removes corresponding mapping from the via the removeall and it does not support add or addall concurentmap question when map is modified and iterating over

 be able to post more useful stuff later but for now i can tell you the term you want to search google for stuff to be frank any kiosk mode is more or less a windows mobile designed for it and as you get into more and more edge cases you are going to find the odd however for the purpose of most programs the following is the ui and the taskbar so that it be your main form set the windowstate to maximized and formborderstyle to older oses you might need to actually disable the taskbar itself and move the form over the top of this is achieved by with the argument may depend on hhtaskbar works for pocket pc and static extern intptr string with the intptr from findwindow and static extern bool bool with the intptr from findwindow and 0 static extern bool intptr int app know the press orange and left button and it will automatically open pocket do this going to break rank here and recommend the only viable way i know of doing this which is to use an undocumented win32 api a perfectly stable call and i have a range of projects running every day that use it i just figure in some future upgrade i might need to modify the code if it gets so bear that in want to setup a system wide keyboard hook via the pinvoke static extern intptr hookhandlerdelegate intptr uint is reasonably complex and its probably better just to point to a guide like to explain the the basic premise is to discover the keycode of the irritating and then block them via the hook pass them working on cf i suggest also digging into opennetcf as i believe it already has a global keyhook inside i said before this perfect and iirc the volume control is not blockable and its possible that a notification such as a new wireless network might intrude upon your kiosk mode if you set various flags in the registry tell it not to do that not that much effort and it should be sufficient for most of your your app run from start is the bit that can differ a fair bit depending on the if you want to stay in managed code the issue is that the netcf come on some in most cases you can just write an unmanaged booter that sits in the autorun directory should be check the and installs your and then runs your if you want to get your hands dirty with unmanaged code then most hardware manufacturers offer some kind of scripting system to setup a device as you see however these may work with varying degrees of

 been a web developer for really quite some time but this is something never really and my progress so far has used some very complex the following is the layout i there are to this layout as i will explain in a header sidebar and the header are and so is the however you can scroll the using the css property on a container for the body section is not an the reason being is that an application which utilises the meaning that the scrollbar not a contain scrollbar is what is used to record the x and y i have achieved this but using some complex layout techniques which just my html looks like the sidebar code using and i use all of these divs for a specific so i can absolutely position borders on the content the rest of the divs actually block off content by changing the background colour of them so you see the content when you css file is far too large to be posting on but the general ul solid 0 0 as you can see from the i set a fixed make it and then set a the containing has a fixed width thus causing a when you horizontally scroll the the content will be hidden when it hits the this creates an effect much like any 10px 20px you can see that the has absolute positioning keeping it in that content anything outside of the content box is displayed even if you scroll horizontally or there better ways of doing it seems a of to be doing something really quite this layout a problem that part even difficult is maintaining simple with a complex and by i mean something unable to i have achieved the desired effect just looking for a better way of doing this is based on business i have a choice

 been trying to find a way to do datatable comparison for a while and ended up writing up my own here is what i tablesareidentical loop through first row in foundidenticalrow loop through temptable to find an identical foreach temprow in allfieldsareidentical compare if any fields are different move on to next row in for i i if allfieldsareidentical if an identical row is remove this row from temptable case of duplicated row exist in so temptable to have the same number of duplicated rows to be considered and move on to next row in if foundidenticalrow if no identical row is found for current row in the two tables are if tablesareidentical to dave mine treats two table with same records but in different orders as hope this helps whoever stumbles upon this thread

 been wondering how to efficiently do this am not sure if this will do the but seems to do what you although you probably want to examine to see how it achieves this as there are some inefficient ways to do thought would be to have the dreaded boolean flag on your models and then creating a custom manager that automatically adds the filter although this work for searches across different yet another solution is to have duplicate models of which seems like but may work for the comments there also discuss different will add that for the most part i consider any of these solutions worth the i usually just suck it up and filter my searches on the boolean it avoids many issues that can come up if you try to get too it is a pain and not very of a reasonable solution would be a mixture of the custom manager while being aware of its limitations if you try searching a related model through

 believe there is a long list of features that oracle has which sql server does that that mean you accomplish the same task in no but these features do mean that oracle can be faster for the same can store data from more than one table on the same take for example the system tables that contain and if you have table in order to extract a all its indexes and query the parent name then go to the parent read the with that then get the take that value into the index on the fk on column get the go to the with those repeat for the other two a lot of oracle you can specify that those four tables will live on the same table cluster all based on the so the read would look check the cluster index for location of that table and grab all 4 data with one or a couple both systems 4 it would look the same to an application but if minimizing read time were oracle could do it

 best practices start with locking everything then only opening up pieces as necessary to the people that actually need to get to allowing the access to even regardless of the fact that they have rights to do opens the door just a enough to exploit a buffer overflow or another type of login and a user are two different a login is server a user is database every user should have a corresponding but not every login will have a database user say you are using active directory integrated and assigned a particular ad group to have access to the only some of those within the group may actually have access to certain those are the people you want to allow access to whereas the other members of the group have regular database user definition this is a problem as some of the group members can connect and list databases on the server even though they have access to any of those the in the door talking you can stop those people from even being able to connect then gone a long way towards securing your are other server level permissions that the public role grants to if you should turn it off just like you would a guest	
 best practices states for performance you should not have more than 2000 items in a you can perfectly well have millions of items in a but you should carefully define your views and use of index columns to only return less than 2000 items at one your list data change often and you have a lot of memory available on the it is worth looking at portalsitemapprovider for querying the info on the various methods to query lists and a full comparative whitepaper can be found	
 best thing to do would be to never store data that if this were in a related table as it should then you could order to your hearts personally it would probably be fastest to at least split the data into a temptable or table variable that has an extra identity column and then sort in desc order on that

 best way is to add the directory to the load path and then the basename of each this is because you want to avoid accidentally requiring the same file twice often not the intended whether a file will be loaded or not is dependent on whether has seen the path passed to it for this simple irb session shows that you can mistakenly require and load the same file require require require require that the first two lines return meaning the same file was loaded both when paths are even if the paths point to the same know that the file was already we add a directory to the load path and then require the basename of each file require you care about the file being required more than or your intention is just to load the contents of the perhaps should be used instead of use load in this because it better expresses what trying to for load file

 biggest one would be using existing 3rd party controls on your most of the inbuilt controls are pretty easy to but if you have a pet 3rd party you might have to host that on a regular aspx page this is the feature where uses different html for different clients you want to do this by but in reality most clients now work with standard so it is less of an issue in the first things like i18n via resx files need extra work than is in the vanilla mvc but the samples are there on the mvc is licensed only for so one thing you do violating the as i understand is to run it in but consider the things you do with that you are with instead of input resolution html jquery etc for simple of templating options just input actionresult pick and off the or form so you have to spend lots of time picking out request templates the only templating for see or you can write your own if you the view is not tied to controls	
 binary distribution of rsync recognize the ssh the command you are trying to execute probably works fine when you put into the shell because something like bash knows how to interpret the ssh command to establish a use the ssh program to create a connection for the rsync from your debugging information i think rsync is expecting a connection but instead receives a string which it fails to get around this you have to let bash do the work for look at in the section on threads to tend the you would need to fork an instance of a command shell and write your command to the shell so something like p osw new bw new writing would probably want to read the processes output too because it will stop executing if you do not read the link provided covers the topic	
 bind your variables ocdecio not only does it prevent sql injection it is also much especially in a multi concurrency read for example variables are placeholders inside a sql when a database receives a sql it determines if the statement has already been executed and stored in if the statement does exist in oracle database can reuse it and skip the task of parsing and optimizing the bind variables makes the statement reusable with different input using bind variables also improves query performance in the eliminates the need for special handling of literal quotation marks in the and protects against sql injection

 blank line is somewhat easier for repeated entry of multiple after the user finishes one record the user just tabs again to a newly created blank line and keeps no need to reach for the the use of a blank line also results in the records being in the order the user making it easy to check work as one if you know the task is to enter records the table is you can the cursor in the blank row to save the user the trouble of finding and clicking the insert insert button is somewhat easier for adding records intermixed among other the user have to scroll to the end of the table before which generally takes longer than hitting a button and makes a user lose place in the for tables already filled with an insert button may be more discoverable than the blank line assuming the button is always in view blank at the bottom is scrolled out of and user may not think to scroll down and find of have both an insert button and a blank or otherwise try to have the best of both for you can have the insert button but if a table is you can open it with a blank line for the tabbing from the last field in the last line could be an means of inserting a line for data entry or the insert button can have an accelerator key maybe so the data entry users can use it to insert multiple records without their fingers leaving their the insert button maybe should also insert a new record below the current one so that new records are in the order they are	
 blend functions use premultiplied rgb channel by alpha bitmaps for however premultiplying by alpha is a very costly since you have to treat each pixel one by seem that it would be a good candidate for sse is there someone here that would want to share its i know that this is hard work so the reason i not trying to steal your get all my consideration for sharing this if you not trying to do alpha blending by trying to premultiply each color component of each pixel in an image by its doing this because the alpha blend is done by the formula however the alphablend win32 function does implement for optimisation to get the correct result you need that src be equal to before calling would take me a bit of time to write as i know little about assembly so i was asking if someone would like to share its sse would be great as in the paper the gain would alpha blending by software is someone have an optimized function to premultiply bitmap by

 bug was a major issue for my worked around it a long time ago by using a conditional rule in an file that would disable all caching of images on the site for firefox this was a horrible thing to need to but at the time i track down the bug within firefox and having the site be slightly slower is better than showing i read in the linked bug that it was fixed in the latest firefox i changed the conditional on april 19th 2009 to only disable caching for firefox 2 few hours later received over 10 from firefox 3 users that they were seeing duplicate so this issue is still a problem in firefox decided to create a simple linux test program that would allow me to check to see if they are generating the same cache hash compile in any linux ffgenhash is the code to file long char unsigned long unsigned char s char h return char return you can here are two real life that generate the same cache hash i these images in a javascript trying to use some sort of empty tag workaround is not possible i think my only real solution is to modify the for firefox users in some way to generate a unique cache hash so the approach the half tempted to create a firebug addition that will check all resources loaded by a site and give a big error if two resources on the site share a common hash key so the developer is it would be great to run sites like google maps through this as seen weird things with those images over the past few years

 c contains the raw power and flexibility which surpasses most modern learning c would not give you much of an edge when transitioning to other worked with and javascript before i started programming in with a language like or java might be better for a beginner since it saves you the pain of having to worry about most of the core functioanality of your programs memory data structures it would certainly be a great advantage if you could learn c and as you move	
 c is great because it does nothing behind your back bounds it only does exactly what you tell it nothing is even does things you tell it too with raii it is implied that the object is destructed when it goes out of but you actually write c is a great way to learn what goes on the of the without having to write	
 c is not a requirement to being able to effectively use but it certainly can help ones general understanding of how computers and software work i think similar to an assertion that knowing some assembly language or computer logic can help a c programmer be a better in order to solve a problem it helps to know how things are working what think this means a programmer know c in order to be a good but i think that knowing c can be helpful to almost any

 came from webform development like from up until when i discovered mvc it took me about 6 months to convince my peers my that it is the way to of the highlights of my control of html ajax of update of using jquery exponentially increased of concern and faster is a little bit but i did try to prove it by building for my i built a simple dashboard web using both webform and i showed my peers and my boss the as well as the complexity of building and maintaining each in the we migrate our main methodology from webform to is true that it takes a while to some webform but once you get mvc is so much easier to pick up and you can run with yes it is but often in large we spend a lot of our time trying to or a server control to behave and perform like the way we want it and as complexity of the system goes the complexity of this customization also goes up ajax is also quite difficult in updatepanel has its but nested update panels has its own share of problems as me and my it boils down to the ability to control our instead of automatically generated by the framework but we have to spend a lot of time and effort to get the rest combined with and your prefered biz tier framework or is extremely so far to we have released 3 production releases with mvc and they all perform well heck take a look at uses mvc

 can pass an array by but you have to first wrap it in a struct or or simply use a type like think the decision was for the sake of one want to do this most of the the same reasoning as why there are no unsigned there is no associated cpu so you have to make not efficient very hard to do in a language like and boost both have wrapped native arrays into structs providing and which i would always prefer because it allows passing and returning of arrays within array is a pointer to the memory that holds that array and the note it is not the exact same as a pointer to the first element of the people think that you have to pass an array as a pointer and specify the size as a separate but this is not you can pass a reference to the actual array itself while maintaining you need the size because you have reduced your array to an pointing to the first int function can take in an array of size as test2 but by to access elements you need to people may say that the size of an array is not this is not what about allocations on the allocations on the heap do not return an they return a pointer to the first element of an so new is not type if you do indeed have an array then you will know the size of what it

 can speak to this from recent painful this is a very old method that predates the metadata api on which both ant and eclipse in our only benefit is in defining your if using eclipse we and i you can define your project as being based on a particular as long as you remember to add new components to your your project hangs thing that baffled us for a are the many uses of noted the these come in managed and unmanaged flavors and are in the words of a recent post on the sfdc for isvs to deploy their stuff into various unknown orgs both managed and unmanaged packages have limitations that make them unsuitable and unneeded for deployment from development to production within an or in any case where doing custom development and intend to distribute code to a large anonymous this is what you see when you click in the web that we sometimes call seem to be just a convenient way to keep a project definition the conclusion coming toward is that our team not an does not need packages in any other forms of both eclipse and rely on the metadata in theory they are capable of exactly the same in reality they appear to be the migration built into the ide for makes deployment as easy as it can be is not and gives you a nice look at what it intends to on the other seen ant do some things the ide could so probably worthwhile to learn process leaning toward is to keep all our projects in and use the svn structure as the project definition will work with this and respect and we use eclipse and sometimes ant for no apparent need for packages the one more thing to be aware of not all components are some things must be reconfigured by hand in the target one example would be queues and groups also need to i likewise the metadata api directly process field deletions so if you deleted a field in your you need to delete it by hand in the there are other cases as useful steve

 can think of a few different ways to do some of which use jquery depending on what you are trying to custom css and have your view choose which css file to use based on the selection from the this would be view code that constructs a css link based on the value of the database apply classes to your controls from the theme theme would have the same just different settings for each want the user to be able to actually change a particular look and not merely choose a in this case there are a couple of different options one have a helper that generates custom css for the user based on the database values again using common classes so that you can style the controls with call this helper from your view and inject the correct css into the page either directly or as a link to an action that generates the css in response to a and i like this set the style property on the control itself using the view layout and get the value of the background color property from new id want to have the color change dynamically based on a user action and have the new come from the in this case you can inject the color into the script tag where your jquery lives see any need to use a hidden

 can use another header file for exporting functionality to outside modules than you have for the internal functionality and thus you have to declare globals that have to be accessible from outside the is only linker problems if you declare things more than there is no need to keep all global data in one header in there may be a wise reason top split it up into several smaller pieces for maintainability and different areas of splitting up into header files for external data and internal data is one such reason and this should not be a problem since it is possible to include more than one header file into the same source and forget the guards in the header this collision in linking is mostly

 choice does make a but predicting which container will be the most efficient is very the best approach is to use the container that is easiest for your application to work with see if sorting is adequately fast with that and if so stick wth if do performance profiling on your sorting problem and choose different container based on the profile an and i sometimes feel personally responsible for the common idea that a linked list has mystical performance enhancing take it from one who the only reason a linked list appear in so many text books and tutorials is because it is covenient for the people who wrote those books and tutorials to have a data structure that can illustrate dynamic memory searching and sorting all in one it has nothing to do with

 clever use of another tool freely available on windows the following two scripts do the job you get password with no set in do set this just to prove we have the get password with no echo then echo oscriptpw simply uses the password object to input the password from the user and then print it to standard output next paragraph will explain why that show up in the is a bit trickier command scripts usually set is somewhat sneaky the effect of the command is to output the prompt with no trailing newline character a sneaky way to emulate the command from the it sets to an empty string as an irrelevant side effect and wait for input since taking its input from the used this trick for things like this as well as providing progress bars in a command window fancy gui installs for my no sir in do set statement is the trickiest it runs the vbscript with no microsoft so that the only line output is the password the vbscript the delimiters to nothing is required to capture input lines with otherwise you just get the first the do set sets to be the actual password output from the we echo a blank line terminate the and echo the password so you can verify it works to imagine typed in is my the on the not is my is available with xp and 2003 but not later versions windows 2008 and windows i in order to rectify you simply copy the file from the folder of an xp or windows 2003 system to the or folder on your own once the dll has been you will need to register it by successfully register the dll on vista and you will need administrator

 code smell here is the hard coded values in the case for the returns it is more a question of taste and good sure if your case spans mutiple pages it is easier to read if the return is in the but then the problem is the big switch to begin i prefer the single return option because if ever you need to add some more processing then it is cheaper to refactor than visiting all the if given to someone else to refactor they will not have the temptation to copy paste the code in every least i would hope so if they do they better hope i am not the one doing their code review the copy paste

 correct me python experts if i am i am also learning the following is my current understanding of why the exception was you cannot create a variable that can be access across modules without specifying the module name to access the global variable in module you need to use when you in module the scope of the global variable is pretty much limited to the module when you have following in global print here refers to in the module setting in will put the variable in the namespace because this is the you provided to the python interpreter to this will be in a different namespace and not in the module namespace where it is required to python generates a because it cannot find the variable after searching the module global namespace and namespace function namespace is skipped because of the for to you need to set in the module namespace in more details about scope and namespaces	
 correct that you should not inherit from stl virtual functions would make them meaningfully larger the base size of vectors would jump from 12 to 16 bytes the implementation besides virtual functions are difficult to which can slow down the if you find yourself making an array of a million the difference adds up pretty can still get the effect you want by declaring the vector as a member variable in your itemlist and then thunking through any methods that you wish to itemlist item typedef item int int item offset return const return and so this is a fair amount of grunt but it will give you the effect you asked

 could add the id value to the end of the name when a record is so when someone deletes id 3 the name becomes and then when they delete id 100 the name becomes this would allow you to create a unique composite index on the name and deleted fields but you then have to filter the name column whenever you display it and remove the id from the end of the a better solution would be to replace your deleted column with a column of type you could then maintain a unique index on name and deleted with a record having a null value in the this would prevent the creation of multiple names in an active state but would allow you to delete the same name multiple obviously need to do a test when undeleting a record to ensure that there is no row with the same name and a null field before allowing the could actually implement all of this logic within the database by using an trigger for the this trigger would not delete records but would instead update the column when you deleted a following example code demonstrates table swtest id int name datetime trigger on swtest of delete update swtest set where id in from and is null required to prevent duplicates when deleting already deleted records unique index on into swtest values into swtest values from swtest where id into swtest values from swtest where id into swtest values from swtest table select from this query returns the name thingy1 thingy2 thingy2 thingy2 within your code you can delete records using a normal delete and let the trigger take care of the the only possible issue i could was that deleting already deleted records could result in duplicate hence the condition in the trigger to not update the field on an already deleted

 creating an abstract class that can be inherited in a partial class of a linq to sql the linq to sql class contains a bunch of partial is there a way that i can implement one or more of the partial methods in the abstract i know that partial methods can only be contained within partial classes or sure got to be another way to do more may have a database table called if i create a linq to sql dbml file containing this the code generates a partial class for partial class contains several partial have a class that building that contains several methods that like to use across all my linq to sql of these methods is a partial method added to each linq to sql i have a common body to use for this rather than adding this method to each partial looking for a way to create it once and inherit it with my base class that helps explain method inside abstract class

 crosses all of the mvc that it go into just one of view or ajax scripts will be calling scripts on your site so this would involve a section of your layer which created for the controller in turn would access the database using the interface provided by your just as a request data for the response back to the client may be packaged as json or xml or technically this is the task of your though if your definition of a view layer is nothing more than html templating rather than and formatting anything that gets sent back to the client whether html or something else like then your xml or json generation may need to go into a new little section of its for sending the scripts this is probably going to be handled directly by the web server rather than from within your mvc

 curious about the not mentioned in the reference guide and in the javadoc described extension of the which provides ability to create new users and existing implementing the interface you have to implement five methods of its own and one which it inherits from the userdetailsservice which it methods userexists and the inherited method the spring security framework there are two concrete implementations of and the interface and the concrete implementations are implemented by luke seems the spring security framework never uses the concrete conclusion is that the interface is included purely as a convenience interface which the user of the framework may or may not decide to perhaps there were some thought that later on more concrete implementations would exist and take out some of the work for the framework looking for is more for the information to be of value it has to come directly or guess this is most from someone with insight into the framework development anyone else can just make like i just did just a convenience there more such interfaces and classes which appear in the reference guide as interested in knowing as it might be helpful to me during through all interfaces and classes to see which ones are actually used inside the framework is a bit tideous and it could also be error prone if reflection is involved calls are made which my ide figure what is the userdetailsmanager interface used and

 currently trying to get openvg up and running on my the problem comes i am will be developing an application for a windows ce device compact which has opengl es and openvg on ti if the application will definitely use openvg for and likely opengl for some effects if openvg offer them like to develop on my desktop without the emulator so i thought i just import openvg with which was quite since the openvg people made their constants into real and though a procedural c it translated very well into an form a graphics class for drawing and stroke and image i also managed to get going with named dlls and entry and i imported egl also quite easy to translate to an this it sounded quite i thought just use the openvg reference implementation from but it is really you like clearing the surface taking literally a so i openvg is a just take one of the other most of them are based on which is what i or creating an opengl es surface with egl with the powervr windows emulation sdk for opengl es is not compatible with any openvg implementation i some of them require traditional opengl the egl version supplied by powervr support most implementations even have egl and use some bizarre functions to initialize the context all of them assuming that an opengl context has already been not opengl only one i could get to work was amanithvg which is very fast for a software implementation and does not rely on opengl or it but it is still far too slow for real time believe that these things feel so really tempted to just use for which powervr supplies an emulation layer for desktop in the hope that the final board support package will supply direct3d as an opengl es like it seems to be on many the there any openvg implementation for windows desktop systems that works with opengl es bonus points if it works smoothly with opengl es emulation and the supplied egl should i just try to use a traditional opengl implementation on the but typically not supplying egl as i want to have two initialization layers and or should this is not a because the problem is the very same without openvg implementation on desktop based on opengl

 currently use codeigniter as my framework of choice when using one of the things i am wrestling with is the idea of a and how to represent that properly within to my codeigniter has a front controller that delegates to page in my thought each page would have own all too often though i see someone using a page controller stuffed with many so in that each action becomes own never really liked the idea of stuffing many methods into one because it seems like there will be too much overhead if you only need one method or two in the controller at a seems more reasonable for each page to have own and the actions would only correspond to something you can do on that particular am i thinking about this the wrong makes it more confusing is notice in some web applications where they will have one controller that will have multiple methods but then on others they actually have a login and a register what is the proper use of a defines the traditional concept in

 database architecture consists of two sql server 2005 servers each with an instance of the same database one for all and one for all we use transactional replication to keep the read database two servers are very indeed write server has 32gb of and are connected via a fibre deciding upon this architecture we were led to believe that the latency for data to be replicated to the read server would be in the order of a few milliseconds on in practice we are seeing latency of around seconds in even the simplest of which is by a simplest i mean updating a single value in a single row in a single table on the write db and seeing how long it takes to observe the new value in the read factors should we be looking at to achieve latency below 1 is this even is there a different mode of replication we should what is the best practice for the locations of the data and log to all for the advice and insight i believe that the latency periods we are experiencing we were by our db hosting company as to what latency times to using the technique described near the bottom of msdn the heading and failed to deal properly with this consequence of creating such specialized databases is a write is now going to take time to be distributed to the reader but if you can deal with the the scaling potential is now looking at implementing a change to our caching mechanism that enforces reads from the write database when an item of data is considered to be it possible to get latency with transactional

 default setting for is so by expanding and collapsing of nodes should be happening client note the remarks for that property though the enableclientscript property to specify whether the treeview control renders script on compatible browsers to handle expanding and collapsing when this property is set to compatible browsers execute the code to expand and collapse nodes on the tree node data must be known in advance for the script to using client script prevents a post back to the server each time a node is expanded or to do have the node data avaiable to the tree view data source without a set enableclientscript to not using a control adaptor overriding this somehow confusing the server into thinking that a page is running on i so might be different to your server it treats my version of ie with an overweight useragent string as because the check cuts off after 128 and you have all the data then you should ensure that you are setting and to no reason why you do what attempting to do with a tree view control it should do most of this for you unless you supplying the whole tree up in which case need to supply the methods that will populate the nodes through populatenodesfromclient and assuming the browser is recognised correctly previous links have examples of both with and without jquery tree view plugins will probably be more flexible not used them so i know i have used the treeview control but was getting the features because i only had a small and was supplying all the data up but will require a bit more work to set need to pull in the jquery if not already using a web service that it can call to get the initial data along with subsequent worry about what happens to browsers with limited or no javascript may or may not be the kicker for you in everything we we try to use javascript to enhance not provide the functionality as the jquery library is all client if the browser support your jquery treeview control and possibly be losing a key navigational whereas a server control like the treeview control will notice that javascript supported and resolve this for you by falling back to a server based version of the should also remember that jquery a microsoft thing they do now and has been around for quite some and as a client side it works independantly of the server technology ms give us a number of controls within the framework that we use if we want and doing so can make our lives easier in the short term but we have to a prime example is the recently released mvc which is a different way of building web applications on iis using the stack but generally without the server

 definitely looks like a bug in the view merging code of the oracle i bet you only get this with views which contain outer your solves because it practically forces a on the put either an or a hint inside the view because on your data it could degrade performance of other queries which use the you should put a hint in the outer 1 should also raise an sr with oracle as this is definitely a that query should never ever return any rows no matter what you are selecting or how complex it is never reproduce so probably fixed in the version the db version you are	
 definitely possible to specify a property on an ifoo string name string age read otherwise you are interfaces specify no behavior and hence can only define methods and the implementation must be done on every single the price that is paid for flexibility in the behavior is truly identical between all of the child classes then i usually go for an abstract or often a namely define an interface and a base implementation which implements that foo ifoo private string public name get return set public age get return allows you the flexibility of a quick implementation with the choice of usincg an interface for classes that for some reason cannot derive from

 department is working on a project that requires us to heavily communicate with another whose software ours has to interact this resulted in a 4 hour conference call where the whole team had to with very few results and no progress in the actual coding at to it was a complete waste of except for maybe 15 minutes where we discussed a problem i am facing in my task reaching any consensus on how to softwares have to but are nominally different since both teams are from different nobody is nominally in charge of both of so we have to resolve all differences between with interdepartmental politics shining in all their am looking for a way to reduce the time spent procrastinating in those any management solution someone who is in charge of the who takes is a no since we are all i think that a software solution for communicating with the other devs would be easy to am specifically looking for something the existing the interface requirements by the opposite me establish relations between those two in a fulfills requirement me mark an interface as tested buggy a report which requirements have no interface to fulfill a report which requirements have not been implemented yet you know of any tools that could provide i would prefer web based and free software in because this is only my personal and there is no budget know that stephan eggermont is we are having behaviour that is something that i am unable to change i hence my idea to fix the symptom instead of the solution for communication between two

 depends on the linker and how the library was usually libraries are a combination of object files libraries are a major exception to older linkers would pull things into the output file image at a granularity of the object files that were put into the so if function and function were both in the same object they would both be in the output file even if only one of the 2 functions were actually is a reason why often see projects with a policy of a single c function per source that way each function is packaged in its own object file and linkers have no problem pulling in only what is however that newer linkers newer microsoft have the ability to pull in only parts of object files that are so less of a need today to enforce a policy though there are reasonable arguments that that should be done anyway for

 deserializing a fair amount of data through for each when i output how long the deserialization it varies it is not unusably slow at the but it would be nice to make it the data represents the same maps and vectors but merely with different at the memory spiking as each deserialization takes i have to believe a better way of doing this than continually allocating and deallocating all this a few of the read times as an 390 422 422 422 438 2156 1797 1656 1328 1219 1078 1078 there a way of writing a custom deserialization function for the same data that uses so i can specify to allocate the memory at the and then just change their values for each i realised a minor issue with the optimization flags i was using was causing the serialization data to be written which resulted in the inconsistency of deserialization after fixing it is now consistently at 750 780 milliseconds each my original question still as currently i am serializing and deserializing an entire stl when i really want to only serialize the contents the size and indexing of the container will remain exactly the not sure of the best way to go about doing this deserialization

 developing and loading oracle xml gateway message there are several methods you can employ to track they are all manual and require setting a standard within a development from version tracking tools like svn each time you change a message you can change the map name in the properties then each time you load the you will be able to choose which version you want to from the trading partner setup in the xml if your question is how to compare two existing map files to find the differences between the most effective way is to start two sessions of message tile them and move through them side by identifying which elements are mapped to which is relatively straightforward you are comparing slight variations of the same source and target definitions and you can focus particularly on elements or levels that have a blue circle icon in the element mapping tab where the logic used becomes true that the map files themselves are in but it is of little use to compare the xml one to the other using a comparison really no substitute in this instance for human using the message designer tool to compare exposes the logic and the and post process procedures as well as the elements this if i have misunderstood the question please feel free to elaborate and be happy to answer xml gateway

 done since there is no continuity in your problem value of a position is not closely related to an other position with only 1 change in the value of one there is very little chance a nn would and it never did in my would rather see a simulated annealing system with an heuristic which there are plenty out to evaluate the value of the if you are set on using a is is relatively easy to a general nn is simply a with each node being a each neuron has a current activation and a transition formula to compute the next activation based on input activation values of all the nodes that have a link to more classical that is with an input an output identical neurons for each and no can thus be represented by an array of input an array of output and a linked graph of nodes connecting each node possesses a current activation and a list of nodes it forwards computing the output value is simply setting the activations of the input neurons to the input and iterating through each subsequent layer in computing the activation values from the previous layer using the transition when you have reached the last you have your

 edited i initially criticised the problem description as my problems stem from way the concept of a is used in the the question implies the programs and tracks are all stored in one i thought the questioner was building his own which would make this in one structure but i have now decided probably not doing in which case less so go ahead and offer a real based on the assumption using an existing file and his entire data structure is stored in one file within that file if i am assuming wrong no doubt be will first offer one piece of general advice for situations like look at things from the perspective of the api user then design your api so that the code he will write flows easily with no need to deal with the details that are properly in your way to work on your api design is to write some user code first and define the api so that that code is easy to as a after you actually implement the api then have some test code to try it out on to more specific is a catalog of the three data types in the we can treat them as abstract data types or if you like and define a struct track to represent each a collection of programs stored in a a collection of a collection of audio would propose that you make your users pick out data from the you really hide the internals of the structures in c jumping through hoops with casting but you can provde a family of functions that your users do what they need to do without accessing the contents of the abstract types for example our family of functions might look like disc const char int file disc program disc const char disc int int program track program const char program int unsigned char int unsigned long offset track should all be reasonably self explanantory it is modelled on the existing standard c file your user obtains a ptr to disc with assuming this works will return null if it he can obtain any global disc information with more to the point he can obtain a ptr to a progam within the disc with one of the family of a ptr to program he can drill down further and obtain a single track with one of the family of very important point is that you make your user iterate through the audio fragments himself to get data from the the user provides a buffer to read the samples and you iterate as necessary through the fragments to fill that the function is provided to give him random tried to work out the details of every parameter and how errors are handled i am just presenting a concept to be that the paradigm is used an introductory and a concluding sandwiches operations on every

 even as a rule of simply saying hard to make them but frameworks are very much like simulation and various other the fact that hard in javaworld a fact about but about the abstractions available in another like both fairly are pretty still sounds like he has the wrong i see anything inherent in the problem that forces a locking the i come in since we are using we will naturally be doing separately within each and unfortunately we have the lock ordering we have different kinds of activities going that want to acquire locks in so deadlock is why is deadlock almost because two different kinds of activities are going on that want to acquire locks in opposite and that is because will naturally be doing locking separately within each other chosen or had chosen for him by the environment abstractions that support his it he appears to that thus there are no abstractions that i find this start by examining two we will be doing locking separately within and have events going on that want to acquire locks in opposite my usually means really looked for other and i very much doubt that the events want to acquire locks in opposite yu get a you do and you release point he appears to be presenting the fact that he finds it hard to come up with a scheme that work as a theorem to say that no scheme a lot more details about the hard to construct a but as i said there are lots of examples of systems that have events going on every which from internal processes and that manage to have many concurrent threads of control and erlang came to mind because one class of those is the one for which erlang was and in fact those sorts of issues are erlang was

 everyone else is correct about the performance of virtual methods and i think the real problem is whether the team knows about the definition of the virtual keyword in this what is the void b public void a new b new a2 new return surprising nothing is if the virtual keyword is added to the front of foo in both a and b we get this for the much what everyone you mentioned that there are bugs because someone forgot to add a virtual so consider this code the virtual keyword is added to but not b what is the output virtual void b public void a new b new a2 new return the same as if the virtual keyword is added to the reason is that the signature for matches exactly as and because foo is so is consider the case where foo is virtual and is what is the output in this the output virtual keyword works downwards in the not it never makes the base class methods the first time a virtual method is encountered in the hierarchy is when the polymorphism there a way for later classes to make previous classes have virtual forget that virtual methods mean that this class is giving future classes the ability to some of its if you have a rule to remove the virtual it may not have the intended virtual keyword in is a powerful you should make sure each member of the team really knows this concept so that it can be used as

 executable file you see is microsofts pe it is essentially a which holds some operating system specific data about a program and the program data itself split into several for example static data are stored in seperate format of the section depends on what is in the code section holds the machine code according to the executable target in the most common cases this is intel x86 or as for microsoft pe the format of the machine code is cisc and originates back to the 8086 and the important aspect of cisc is that its instruction size is not you have to start reading at the right place to get something valuable out of intel publishes good manuals on the instruction can use a disassembler to view the machine code in combination with the manuals you can guess the source code most of the then msil the executables holding microsofts intermediate these do not contain machine specific but cil the specifications for that are available online at the can be viewed with a tool such as

 experienced when executing psexec against a remote but i always attributed it to the security context in which the remote process was running psexec you omit a username the process runs in the same account which you execute but the process is impersonating will not have access to resources on the remote you specify a username the process executes in the and will have access to network resources the account access note that the password transmitted in clear text to remote your executing a process that then needs to access the database then it could be failing trying to access the network depending on how psexec was if thats the imagine it would eventually time out and give some sort of resource unavailable are two things that generally done when executing deployment steps against a remote machine to prevent the behavior your rifferte make sure all assets needed are local to the psexec to execute the script that everything runs remote psexec domain it note that is passed in clear the remote

 explicitly specializing a function without fully specializing all outer template is not possible explicit function specialization is a real function there be any around it that are still parameterized by a simple way is to use a type2type template together with struct t2t typedef t parm1 arg2 class class v void parm1 parm2 class type void parm1 parm2 it will call the second overload if you call it with and the first because the first one is less is possible parm1 arg2 class type typename parm1 parm2 class type typename parm1 parm2 the second one is taken if is and the first one is taken if is something else but using a different this one is called an alternative but which again adds one parameter is this to demonstrate the way sfinae parm1 arg2 class type parm1 parm2 class type parm1 parm2 happens if the substitution of a template parameter yields to an invalid type or we try to create a pointer to an array of size 0 or 1 an array of size 0 is not and will cause an sfinae failure the corresponding template specialization will not be considered as a if it is a the case it works if is given something derived from then it makes its typedef not derives itself from in the case types are not the we would then try to access a not existent name which is an invalid construct and would therefor be an sfinae failure

 first an example in two 1 2 2 3 6 7 8 9 start in the top left and put the value into the result you have to add all candidates that are reachable incrementing exactly one from there to some sort of sorted that is the cells with the values 3 and then you take the lowest member out of that put its value into the result add all candidates reachable from there that are not yet in the collection into and so will data structure holding a with all indices and the result value represent that below as data structure for a collection of sorted by a heap seems ideal for will have to make sure that all candidates are unique by their indices when you put them into the the values are not necessarily but the heap should be sorted by since a given set of indices always produce the same you will have to check for uniqueness of the indices only when you encounter that value while inserting into the it might be an optimization to make the nodes of the heap not single candidates but a list of candidates with the same this with the above the result list is the candidates are and take the candidate with the lowest value put the value into the result list find all new coordinates and calculate their values and put them into the heap representation tabular 3 3 4 3 4 6 3 4 6 7 3 4 6 7 8 3 4 6 7 8 8 3 4 6 7 8 8 9 see a better way at the the heap seems to need a number of nodes in the magnitude of the sum of and

 first interesting part would be to why do you an object changes its class at are various want it to respond differently to some methods for a given state of the might want it to have new functionality that the original class typed languages such as java and allow this to because the type of the object should be know at compile programming languages such as python and ruby may allow this i know for but i know they can add methods at runtime the first the answer given by charlie flowers is using the state patterns would allow a class behave differently but the object will have the same the second you would need to change the object type anyway and assign it to a new reference with the extra so you will need to create another distinct object and end up with two different

 form controller as or uses commands to pass data between the html form and my question is it common practice to use the backing model as the command or is it common to create a separate command with correspond attributes to those in the backing issue is that to use the backing model as the property editors are necessary for conversion of imagine a data model with many strongly typed custom field on a form property editor does the conversion before the validator is if the type conversion is not possible input then the validator never gets a chance to provide a detailed error all displayed on the html form is a generic error see my stackoverflow alternative is to create a separate command that duplicates each field in the backing but as a in this way the validator can validate the string representation of each the is then responsible for converting the command to the backing from my research of spring this appears to be intended my hesitation to go down this path is the cumbersome manner in which a separate command needs to be created for each data then the added work having to marshal between the command and the data so much more convenient to have the form directly edit the backing model and use property editors to do the the problem then is curious how others approach the issue of editing of models that contain custom typed of spring form

 forms are objects like everything so you should think of the problem in those the child form will need access to the parent you can provide that by passing the parent form reference to the child form through the a or a the constructor makes the most you can change the values in parent form from the i would say this the best the child should expose an event indicating that the data changed well as the mechanism to get that and then the parent should subscribe to that event and update itself with the data when it is	
 formula is more factor is the per entry maps are typically implemented as these are binary so there will be at least two pointers for the there will also be some implementation stuff probably a parent pointer and a so factor may be something like rbnode 3 all this is highly implementation dependent to find out for sure you really need to examine the code for your own library

 get to work with a number of mostly with developers and sometimes directly with the one thing that comes up often is that when architects prescribe an application they want it to be followed consistently every time with little to no room for good example of this is the presentation model when i think of this i think of it as have an object model to represent the state and behaviors of the current and a view object that surfaces it to the in my the things representing the state is more conceptual than a prescriptive a view might use many objects to represent this or it might use or perhaps it is so simple that it needs or perhaps it shares the ethos of the pattern is that we seperate the state management from the visualization often what i come across is the patterns being intepreted much more a typical project might look like the model object is or the viewmodel is just forwarding property to the model sometimes the view is so that the extra objects just make it more complicated than it needs to do you prefer developers follow the same process every time like a or do you prefer to leave the details up to the much autonomy do you give developers in applying

 group is building a process modelling application that simulates an industrial the final output of this process is a set of number representing chemistry and flow application is based on some very old software that uses the exact same underlying mathematical model to create the thousands of variables are involved in the each component has been unit we now need to be able to make sure that the data output produced by our software matches that of the old simulation i am wondering how best to approach this issue in a formalised and rigorous old program works by specifying the input via a text so i was thinking we could programatically take each adjust its value in the file correspondingly in our new then compare the outputs between the new and old we do this for every variable in the know the allowable range for each variable so i suppose a random sample across each variable of a few values is enough to show correctness for that particular thoughts on this any other testing for process modelling

 guess this is more a question about coding style than you have a straightforward with no there is little reason to mark the termination of the program by anything is not going to return anything that anybody can since your program ends is just going to exit with status which would happen naturally if the structure is more i would advise to the termination point by something to signal to someone who reads your code for that defined set of there is nothing to take into account there would use rather than for the simple reason that return can be mistaken for the end of a whereas exit very specifically states that the program at this

 guilty of this it seems to me there be any good reason for a table to not have an identity field primary whether you want to or you can now uniquely identify every row in your table which previously you could not you do sql replication without a primary key on your an extra 32 bits for each row of your for example the case where you need to store user settings in a table in your you have a column for the setting name and a column for the setting no primary key is but having an integer identity column and using it as your primary key seems like a best practice for any table you ever there other reasons besides size that every table just have an integer identity there any good reasons to have a database table without an integer primary

 had good luck hiring open source maintainers to enhance libraries that we are some projects done in the needed to integrate quake 2 with we hired vadim a major contributor to in less than 4 he built a wxquake2 widget by adapting the windows version of quake we needed to portable access to raw so we hired vadim and worked with him to produce a new raw bitmap this involved a substantial bit of design but we really liked the resulting and we use it to this a later we hired another one of the core contributors to improve wxwidgets accessibility as it turned we ended up not using this code right for various technical but other people have been enhancing this code since and we hope to use it some other hiring open source maintainers is a lot like hiring any other kind of but some things are a bit some advice based on our have the most luck if you want to enhance an existing project and release the changes as open you want to hire members of the core they have the best track the most and they have the best chance of getting your changes merged want to get your changes merged if you be maintaining a local which is a do some who works on the features you care are they somebody enjoy working read the mailing lists and glance at the version control and pick out a few people to the design there may be a bit of the developers are looking at the larger health of the and looking at the needs of a specific this has occasionally made negotiations a bit more complicated for but the final result has typically been a better design than we would have chosen on our most be in any sufficiently large open source several members of the core team will already run consulting in smaller open source generally find several contributors who to run consulting if still hesitant to approach you can always you know anybody be interested in getting paid to work on if not you put them on the and they may tell you who to the been impressed with the professionalism and productivity of open source and i would recommend this route for

 had to be there in at that there were a few commercial smalltalks but the biggest was visualworks from parcplace the marketers at parcplace were idiots choosing to optimize for max dollers per seat rather than max any shop wishing to adopt smalltalk had to pay a couple thousand dollars per developer for a any developer wishing to learn smalltalk either had to get hired to do smalltalk or sink serious cash into buying his own so it was just plain hard to get a chance to learn about that ibm was looking for a successor to cobol for their business they chose smalltalk and developed visualage and made it so the same program could run without modification on everything from mainframes to as400s to smalltalk has a friendly minimal syntax and is easy to learn so it seemed a natural replacement for the future looked really bright for the companies that were using it were everyone else by a sun showed up with they gave it away free instead of charging for ibm took a look at it and figured two first they want to enter a marketing war with sun that was clearly planning to spend a fortune on the java instead they decided to try to beat sun at their own game have the best java on the why they already had a great vm that ran on their whole stack they just adapted it to handle the java bytecode in all of java tools were actually written in smalltalk for several thus if one wants to blame anyone for the rise of java over smalltalk it is pretty easy to place the blame directly at the feet of ibm and their unwillingness to love i love coding in the being able to archive processes and restore them exactly later if they encounter the amazing the economy of expression and the brilliant class there is a new resurgence in smalltalk development thanks to pharo has some really beautiful ui the new cog seaside and these are all projects working on addressing the historical shortcomings of smalltalk including the poor os integration has a slick native widgets integration and have a new external code integration capability called and i mind that smalltalk that makes it a secret weapon for me and i am really encouraged to see all the new development smalltalk is growing and advancing again and this is good because a lot of the best ideas in software unit refactoring coding all were developed in smalltalk first and then filtered out to the rest of the world in diluted other limitation at the time for smalltalk was application packaging and the lack of dynamic loading large smalltalk applications had to rebuild the image file and redeploy for a java provided dynamic linking at runtime which provided many benefits to packaged by the time smalltalk added dynamic java had won mindshare at ibm so they stopped investing in time

 has a concept called the patient which can be used as we describe to link patient identifier the need for the repetitive use disclosure of an identification information marital of for internal and external and protects privacy of the it preserve the patient anonymity facilitating communication information healthcare fundamentally a a unique patient enables the integration and availability of critically information from sources and multiple care the integrity and of the patient information depend the use of a reliable unique privacy issue hinges not so much on the identifier but on the security and privacy of the data that the identifier is used to and how that access is my understanding is that typically this means that a system querying for information via a patient identifier should only get back information that can not be pieced together to reveal private you would generate an artificial key for each even though it is unique to the it is not personally unless you also were to release personally identifiable information along with for if you let people see only first names with a particular but also returned the artificial then they now know that artificial key 00003 is associated with first name now if you allow them to somehow go back and query with 00003 as and allow them access to the you can see how they can start to accumulate it is important that there be no way for an unauthorized user to get the artifical key and pii returned in the same since that would then make the artifical key itself my interpretation at

 has a good comment on the fundamental there are good commercial solutions doing exactly what you ask they are not free development and may involve recurring with well supported there are also free software but it is more difficult to deliver on all three platforms as you require but more fiddling will add though that installing the runtime is a bit you certainly need to have the separately install a but your program may well need to essentially install the entire runtime in order to depending on what you the flexibility at this level means it can be difficult to programatically determine what bits are and are not which is why the free software solutions usually bother with the somewhat tedious and tricky work of writing a tree shaker to do

 has been my experience been involved in fixing database problems for around 30 years and have dealt with hundreds of different that all too many of the problems in database performance are from the inappropriate attempts to reuse functions are far slower than inline cursors reusing a stored proc that inserts one record at a time are far slower than reusing a proc that gives back what you need and ten other fields is wasteful of server and network using an existing view that joins to ten tables when you only need information from three of them is wasteful of server code reuse in databases is not nearly as good a thing as it is in other this is not to say that code be reused if need just that it should never take precedence over databases are unfortunately not well designed to reuse most databases are not object oriented and thinking in designing or accessing them will often result in a poor you can even think about code you need to have a rock solid normalized database you need to think about how you will be extracting as well as inserting data into the you need to think about how well will this work once there are many users and records because redesigning a basic database structure at this point often becomes too expensive and time it is often far easier to refactor the application code than the basic database structure far too the database refactoring does not get if you change the table structure to go from a denormalized table to a parent child structure because you find out the current structure suiting your then you may end up changing hundreds or even thousands of queries against this this is why it is important to spend a lot of time on database you get the chance to revisit it later due to if you think of the database as the foundation of the house and the application code as the structure you will see why this is it is far harder to change the foundation with the structure on top of it than it is to move the internal databases and the applications which access them are the same

 has been there appear to be any libraries to manipulate open xml documents in but has complete documentation on the format of open xml what you want is to send a copy of a standard document a form customized for each it should be fairly simple given that a docx is a zip file that contains various parts in a directory have a docx that contains all the parts and tree structure that you want to send to users no real then simply create new modify pieces that contain the content you want and inject it into the zip before sending it to the you could have that contains when a user requests the you replace with the then add the resulting to the zip file would contain all the images and other parts you want in the word and send that resulting document to the that if you rename a file to it is trivial to explore the structure and format of the parts you can remove or replace images or other parts very easily with any zip manipulation tools or programmatically with a brand new word document with completely custom content from raw xml would be very difficult without access to an api to make the job if you really need to do you might consider installing then use or to create your open xml documents using the xml format sdk since you would just be using the to manipulate open xml it should work okay in which seems to support everything the sdk

 have a application with stories and categories i know that when you save a new instance of a model with a problems come up because the object is not yet in the this problem usually manifests itself on form which can be neatly worked around with what about a situation where there are no forms to speak in my i want to build an api to accept remote since i like and a whole lot of other messaging in our company is in json outgoing messages from this like to be able to receive the implement a factory that converts the values to but like the factory to be as agnostic as possible to the type of also be converted in the same except that insert ignores id and update gets the already existing instance and overrides remote submitter listens to a feed that gives among other the category objects to so it and refer to them by but it have any direct communication with the real question the most easiest consistent to inflate an instance of a django model object that has a manytomanymanager as far as i can any insert of an object with a field will require two database just because it is necessary to obtain a new id but my current awkward solution is to save the object right away and mark it so that functions down the line can play with it and save it as something a little more it seems like one step up would be overriding so that objects without ids save copy some proxy field to then save best of all would be some robust manager object that saves me the what do you object with manytomany in

 have an interesting problem which been looking into and would appreciate some trying to create a tool which mimics the basic capabilities of a requirements management tool as part of a company basic design is a windows setting of folders and documents can be opened in a and document itself contains a hierarchical spreadsheet of excel with if that makes any each chapter contains which are really just some requirements text some other values which complement when the requirement text and attribute values show up as independent columns like with filtering the for this type of program is pretty but where i get hung up on is the document content biggest concern is size and how it relates to as part of this i not only intended to store the current state of each but also the entire list of changes that have been made since day 1 like and then provide fast access to the history of i expect documents in the each document will probably have active over the course of a not unreasonable to assume edits each document itself will acquire an additional rows and by the number of that amounts to nearly rows an additional the next and the next and so old histories can be but it would only be performed by an admin not preferable that do i see there are two ways for me to handle this can try to represent a list all rows of all documents in a single table like how phpbb stores all posts of all forums in a single can try to store the rows of each document in a uniquely named table each document has own the table would have to be given a unique and a master table would contain the list of all documents and the table names that correspond to my which really is are neither really good can anyone offer advice on which approach you would find more given the sql tables on the fly as new content is uploaded a bad

 have noticed exactly the same thing when the 2007 doc is added to the the properties from the list are added to it the event handler is updating the list with the correct values for the uniqueid the inbuilt property mapping to 2007 docs kicks in and overwrites your values with those stored in the 2007 doc raising an item updated event means that the list now has a blank for your you change to an asynchronous event you may see what we did and that the slight delay for asynchronous meant that the property mapping to 2007 docs happened first meaning the value was stored is possible to break the property mapping between the list and but that is only a cannot for the life of me find where this info is on an ms but it is a known perhaps you can hang in there for sp2 even be fixed in but am	
 have noticed that numerous on com point out that it is relatively easy to implement an object that can be used as an inner object in com unless i am missing it seems that aggregation can only be successful in extremely limited scenarios and thus support for it should only be provided when such a scenario is specifically part that troubles me is as com aggregation combines an inner identity with that of an outer the implementor of the outer object selects a subset of the inner interfaces and forwards requests for those interfaces to the inner the inner object forwards all requests for interfaces to the outer now suppose that the inner as part of its constructs child com presumably an interface pointer is passed to that com object so it can communicate with its the inner object has some idea of the interfaces that it however the outer object might have chosen not to forward some of those documentation states that an outer object should not blindly forward this seems to imply that the inner object often cannot hand away interface pointers to other com objects unless the outer object is specifically required to forward all of those interfaces to the inner this is not limited to a child object any place where the inner object implementation passes an interface pointer seem like they could be it appears that aggregation is not general purpose cases where the inner object must communicate with other com places strict requirements on the outer object as to which interfaces minimally must be forwarded and more interfaces cannot be added to this list in future versions of the inner object without breaking compatibility with existing outer objects that do not forward those this a correct seldom description of the way things actually are or is there more to the com aggregation not supportable by most

 help on defining display and currency ensure that an application behaves the same in whichever country it is datawindow expressions and the masks used in display formats and edit masks require notation for that when you specify a number in a datawindow expression or in a number a comma always represents the thousands delimiter and a period always represents the decimal you should also always use the sign to represent the symbol for the locally correct symbols are displayed for numbers and the comma and period are replaced by the delimiters defined in the number settings in the regional or international settings property sheet in the windows control the sign in the mask is replaced by the local currency symbol as defined in the currency setting in the windows control for in countries where a comma represents the decimal place and a period represents users see numbers in those is probably not the answer you were hoping to what i can suggest is use a computed field that will format the number any way you and display it as a input use the currency the user will probably feel more comfortable working with the default system locale

 i have an interesting i am working with a proprietary set of dlls that i have the source the goal is to write an intermediate dll that groups together a large series of funnction calls from the proprietary the problem i am when compiling with is that i get errors for the original dlls along the lines export symbol not i add a main and just compile to an executable everything works as using mingw for thanks for any response to the first either confused about what saying or i word my question very not explicitly trying to export anything from my wrapper i am just calling functions from their the problem is that i get errors that it export these specific symbols from the dll to my the issue is that not even entirely sure what these symbols are i did a search and read somewhere that they be exported because internal symbols that windows i have tried using the directive to the linker but it seem to do i apologize if completely misunderstanding what trying to i think my issue was related to when just compiling a standard executable that uses a dll i was able to include the headers and directly call the functions for a function in the would compile and run i just needed to link the libraries in the linking with the flag i would get these errors main removed of i think it has something to do with the fact that by default attempts to import all symbols from the what i understand is why this happens in the dll vs in an i will try doing it using thank compiling dll that accesses another

 i have found myself doing often lately is declaring typedefs relevant to a particular class inside that typedef typedef types are then used elsewhere in the new lorem i like reduces the noise introduced by the class becomes serves as a statement of intent in the example the lorem class is intended to be reference counted via and stored in a allows the implementation to change if lorem needed to be changed to be intrusively reference counted at a later stage then this would have minimal impact to the think it looks and is arguably easier to i like are sometimes issues with dependencies if you want to a within another class but only need to forward declare lorem opposed to introducing a dependency on its header then you end up having to use the explicit types rather than which is a little may not be very and hence harder to try to be objective with my coding so it would be good to get some other opinions on it so i can dissect my thinking a little typedefs in good style or bad

 i have undestood what is your real then you need a sort of timer which automatically extends every user session client consequentely overriding the server side default page session expiration timing usually 30 only for detail because i understood that the script every 30 seconds if the user is active on the page so before jsf i always extended inactive user sessions via underground so use it also in your pratically you can build a simple page listener in javascript starting expression msecintervaltiming can be a called function in which you invoke some dummy jsf needed to keep the session alive without reloading the current page visited by the in the past i used standard frame or iframe to make http now with xhr ajax is more simple timerid invoked by some user event denoting his absence here goes all events and logic you need and know for firing the if avoid timerid msecintervaltiming make iframe or make action like page reloading or other invoked by some user event denoting his active it can be also the global variable timerid you use the as a global reference to keep track of the listener so when you need to activate the you assign it a instead when the user come back to the page by some event you you clear the timeout stopping the listener above example obviously implies that the when comes must reload the page in your specifical avoid to interfere with javascript automatically generated by icefaces even for you could simulate periodically some user events on invisible input elements set on not on this causes the icefaces event to not stop it and making itself work like on which you can call periodically invoke the click event by the see the old great js docs of devedge online

 i keep hearing that preparedstatements are good for have a java application in which we use the regular more than we use the while trying to move towards using more i am trying to get a more thorough understanding of how preparedstatements work on the client side and the server if we have some typical crud operations and update an object repeatedly in the does it help to use a i understand that we will have to close the ps every time otherwise it will result in a cursor how does it help with does the driver cache the precompiled statement and give me a copy the next time i do or does the db server understand the argument about the security benefits of preparedstatements and i appreciate the answers below which emphasize however i really want to keep this discussion focused on the performance benefits of when i say update i really mean more in terms of that method randomly being called several i understand the advantage in the answer offered below which asks to the statement inside a some code blah some more code blah blah void update throws preparedstatement ps is no way to actually reuse the java object and i understand that the actual call is quite is what brings me back to the original is this preparedstatement still being cached and reused under the covers that i dont know should also mention that we support several in and

 i love and agree with andy and one other approach you may want to consider is to have a typed master all you have to do is add one directive in your aspx mastertype of accessing a control from your master consider accessing a control in your master page from the page this approach makes a lot of sense when you have a header label on your master and want to set its value from each page that uses the not but i think this would be simpler technique with nested master as you would just point the virtualpath to the master containing the control you wish to it might prove to be tricky though if you want to access two one in each respective master

 i mentioned in a comment the last time you posted if you can crash ie you should this vulnerability can lead at least to a denial of service and potentially a remote code execution or remote root bug that lets a web page crash a browser on demand has a high likelyhood of being exploitable to allow the attacker to run untrusted code on your while people here may be able to help you work around your microsoft really ought to be informed so they can fix the underlying both for trying to work around your own and for the sake of reporting the you should try and reduce the problem to a minimal test strip all of the content down to a minimal set of elements that is sufficient for reproducing the then do the same with the you should endeavor to get a test case that is just one or two and just the crossfades that trigger the with nothing else to report the send them a link to your minimal test case include it inline in the bug report if you mention that it is a remote denial of service and that you know if it could lead to remote code as i cutting this down to a minimal example should be able to help you workaround your at the very more likely to get help here on a minimal code example than an entire site with lots of stuff going on that no one really feels like digging

 i personally would do is to make a script in some scripting language to separate the different data sets before the file is read into and possibly do some of the necessary data you want to do the splitting in look up and is too and is meant for reading a single data you could write the different data sets into different or if you are cook up r objects that are usable with and read from the correct parts of the underlying big you have dealt with separating the data sets into different use on those whichever variant is best if those are not tabs but see if indicates in your be sure to specify it as part of if you do r thinks you have data in that but with the right you automatically get the field converted into it seems that one of your fields can include time stamps like so you need to use and specify a class to which your time stamp format can be if the class just define your own class and an function that does the

 i think i think this is very subjective but also i agree with your you i compared a pattern against one big function cascading the latter is but it is many times easier to parameters to the recursive calls is only a problem if need that degree of i find i do in i think you could make the go away with an application of for say the cascading ifs is more if i understand you i they be more i doubt flexible is is spaghetti code really easy to modify without invoking fears of i broken i rarely worry about whether another implementation of an interface will break existing code as much as i worry about breaking spaghetti code with minor the point of all this the point is not just just use all these patterns and polymorphism because it is the idea is to be more flexible and i think clarity is a side effect of that as there might be some amount of cases where just adding an extra is but i say that is we might be using different defintion of

 i understand it this is a problem you wish to load images from an internet url instead of a local this means that you have to have some way of listing the files available at the remote if you look at the problem you will realize that the only difference between retrieving images from a remote location and from your local system is that the files are easily enumerable using the directoryinfo the method here returns an array of and you can get the actual filename for each using the filename so you need a list of strings that map to the location of the enumerating the files from a remote location alone depends on many factors such as the protocol you are using to retrieve that if using and we can assume that you have some control over the server at that then the url would need to primarily support directory you will then need to parse that served directory list is and server and load all the available image as you can then populate your repeater with that see for a possible the server supports then you work becomes easier because you can enumerate the images using the or if you want to create thumbnails for the you will have to write code to download each save it in a temporary location and then perform dimensional manipulations upon if the list of images available at the internet location is static and you already have that you can simply load that list as a list of strings and set each image src property to that the thumbnails will however remain a unless you can upload your thumbnail creator http at that url so that files are retrieved locally for manipulation and thumbnails are served to you	
 i understand the open session in view pattern need not necessarily mean a unit of work is open for the entirety of the i handle this not webforms but the principle is the by explicitly defining a unit of work in my controller before the controller method returns any database transaction has been so i can handle any data update errors properly at that the session stays open even after the transaction has been for my the open session in view is useful mainly to allow lazy loading of related objects in the view there were 2 main reasons i chose to do it this want to hold any database transactions open while the view is being rendered to the response not and with database the shorter the a having an explicit unit of work is not much extra nhibernate errors that occur in the view stage are less important for me the and any updates have already gone so i can just handle those with a generic redirect error

 i understand you you have 3 tables structured as int not int not not in int not int not not in int not int not null in or you are trying to do is define such that you could cascade updates and deletes between the because of how and are you will guarantee that there is no overlap between the problem is figuring out which table has the reference to you can do with this definition is cascade from or to since the relationship is quite clear in that to cascade from up is more since you know which table to cascade either define two fields in one to reference each of the other and then you can define the relationship between all three knowing that for any given record there will only be one or two tables never all you can use code to figure out which table to relate this particular row to and cascade

 i was in i took several courses that encouraged the adoption and use of agile they were mostly a mess and although i learned a lot of from them they generally the things the professor was expecting us to i do agile development professionally now and love but here are the things i wish that i had known when i was doing agile in things squared with your schedule is really which makes daily standups more not if you sit in the same room then use twitter or yammer or just lot of benefit is simply in getting you into a that just mean weekly it means set commitment to and weekly this is tough to pull off in an academic context but should go a way towards helping you with your procrastination tough to get used to everyone has their own computer and style of try to hook a second up to your existing laptops if or use screen sharing and standardize on an pairing also really helps with procrastination but trying to do it without good tools is an awful lot of skimp on unit even if you think of it as a done projects before that i figured were too small to bother with testing and never failed to come back and bite me on the might be a bit believe it or we still do an awful lot of things on whiteboards or with index you may be your own customer but that mean you have stories estimable and helpful to be able to visualize these features are these are in these are ready for if like software recommendations i can give you those but i do recommend simple paper for a lot of the planning

 idea of a linear index for arrays in matlab is an important an array in matlab is really just a vector of strung out in matlab allows you to use either a row and column or a single linear for 8 1 3 5 4 9 can see the order the elements are stored in memory by unrolling the array into a you can the 8th element is the number in the function find returns its results as a linear result we can access each element in turn of a general array using a single for if we wanted to square the elements of a i know there are better ways to do one might do i 64 1 9 25 16 81 are many circumstances where the linear index is more conversion between the linear index and two dimensional subscripts is accomplished with the sub2ind and ind2sub linear index applies in general to any array in so you can use it on cell the only problem with the linear index is when they get too matlab uses a 32 bit integer to store these so if your array has more then a total of elements in the linear index will it is really only an issue if you use sparse matrices when occasionally this will cause a i use a 64 bit matlab i believe that problem has been resolved for those lucky individuals who

 implementing a trie for predictive text entry in basically autocompletion as far as the use of the trie is made my trie a recursive data structure based on the generic dictionary wordtree inherits letter in a word upper is used as a key to a new a null character on a leaf indicates the termination of a to find a word starting with a prefix i walk the trie as far as my prefix goes then collect all children question is basically on the implementation of the trie using the dictionary hash function to branch my i could use a list and do a linear search over the or do something the smooth move is this a reasonable way to do my to basically asking if the dictionary branching approach is obviously inferior to some other the application in which using this data structure only uses upper case so maybe the array approach is the i might use the same data structure for a more complex typeahead situation in the future in that it sounds like the dictionary is the right approach up to the point where i need to use something more complex in implementation

 important to understand why the overhead of an http request has such an its simplest an http request consists of opening a sending the request on the open socket and reading the open a the stack sends a tcp syn packet to the the server responds with a and the client responds to that with an before you send a single byte of application you have to wait for a whole one and a half round trips to the at the client needs to send the wait for the server to parse the find the requested send it back another round trip plus some server side overhead a small although seen some slow plus the time to transmit the actual and the best assuming no network congestion which would result in packets being dropped and chance you have to avoid you browsers will issue multiple requests in parallel in an attempt to reduce some of the overhead http requests can theoretically be done on the same making things a little but in network round trips are bad for and should be

 in a situation where i need to know when a top level window gets working at the level and on a window manager that support the ewmh my idea is to hook into the root substructurenotify but things are not as simple as just problem is that not every createnotify event corresponds to the creation of a so what i think i need to do is test the window i get from the event somehow to confirm that it is a top level got but some spurious windows still make it through my for in a gtk application if you have a dropdown box and you click a new window is created that i figure out how to catch and such a window is troublesomely indistinguishable from a typical top level application what i have so i am omiting cleanup code and where i set the display and toplevel xtextproperty data xtextproperty return unsigned long nitems unsigned data atom int unsigned long is an interned atom for the int status xgetwindowproperty if success return leader return xclasshint data xclasshint return if window w confirm window has a if confirm window is a client window client xmuclientwindow if client confirm window has a client leader that is not if confirm window has a if the window has passed all our go on to do stuff with the window setting up the event handler for substructurenotify on root window xdefaultrootwindow widget dummy xtcreatewidget xtregisterdrawable xselectinput xtaddraweventhandler long but does anyone have any ideas i could i think of much else i can really do top level events in

 interface definition language is used to set up communications between clients and servers in remote procedure calls there have been many variations of this such and sun onc dce rpc and so you use idl to specify the interface between client and server so that the rpc mechanism can create the code stubs required to call functions across the needs to create stub functions for the client and a using the idl very similar to a function prototype in c but the end result is slightly such client main server function this instead of calling in the same calls a client stub function the same prototype as which is responsible for packaging up the information and getting it across the wire to another this can be the same machine or a different it really matter one of the advantages of rpc is to be able to move servers around at the a process that will receive that information and pass it to the the stub receives the unpacks it and passes it to the real real function then does what it needs to and returns to the server stub which can package up the return information return code and any or and pass it back to the client client stub then unpacks that and passes it back to actual details may differ a little but that explanation should be good enough for a conceptual actual idl may look void int int that stuff at the top is basically networking the meat of it is inside the interface section where the prototypes are this allows the idl compiler to build the x stub and x server functions for compiling and linking with your client and server code to get rpc does use idl think they have a midl for com also used third party products with ms operating both dce and onc

 is a general problem with no absolute problem that if you design your initial you do not know about future requirements and you will have to and while your guesses might be good in some you will miss many other you might even design your code in a way that makes future changes because your guess was terrible i would recommend to stick with the gonna need keep your code respect of and make extensive use of interfaces to keep the impact of changes but do not try to make to much assumptions on future requirements until you really know absolutly agree with cpitis on the point of many projects lack a pricise definition of the the or some other factors that influence the design or you should almost never be in doubt about what to because this is a clear indication of inclomplete	
 is a generic answer in that not familiar with propel at all and only somewhat more familiar with the basic answer is that you use dependency instead of referring directly to your you create a wrapper around then inject the wrapper into your to actually to do unit then you create a mock or fake version of the wrapper that interface to the orm but instead lets you configure the responses from the wrapper to your method this allows you to factor out the orm when unit testing your

 is a lot of enthusiasm around mvc right but if you are starting a new dev project right now still recommend that you carefully consider before jumping on the mvc train just most dev teams on any there are some serious here are the ones i find most requires much more skill from your they will need significant expertise in the inner workings of as well as a good understanding of how http for the client side code they will need strong javascript and jquery and on the server side an advanced grasp of oo and if you plan to get the most from experience with unit testing and mocking frameworks mvc framework currently get much in the way of rad features from visual you get a text editor and but about no no no property while this really that it does often mean that building uis will take significantly especially for less experienced is very and so code and sample apps are very hard to come by and tend to be very limited in documentation is also a bit thin at the biggest drawback to the mvc framework is the lack of an established and mature 3rd party market around with web forms there are tons of very advanced ui suites and components on the market and tons of open source projects you can borrow many especially business apps the lack of 3rd party and advaned grid controls for the mvc framework alone should be a major is and i highly recommend it if you are in a position where you can use but there are real costs and risks for any significantly complex project that may keep you on web forms for a while do expect that the next major version of mvc will probably address many of those especially with the lack of rad i also expect that the enthusiasm around mvc will bring a lot of 3rd party support to the platform but it will take some time for all that to get well	
 is a major ideally your database server should be sitting behind a firewall with only the ports required to perform data access your web application should be connecting to the database server with a sql account that has just enough rights for the application to function and no for example you should remove rights that permit dropping of objects and most certainly you be connecting using accounts such as the event that you lose the web server to a hijack a full blown privilege escalation to administrator the worst case scenario is that your database may be compromised but not the whole database server would be the case if the database server and web server were the same if encrypted your database connection strings and the hacker savvy enough to decrypt them then all lost is the web

 is a really hard question to answer because it depends on what code will be affected and how critical that code and when migration is a nontrivial do yourself a favour and upgrade to the latest version of which would be java 6 not java java 6 has been out for a year and a half or more and is no reason to not pick it over java 5 like any software your goal should be to get something into production as soon as you possibly so you need to identify a slice of your the smaller the the more the other thing to do is just try starting up your app under java 6 and seeing what it might be worse than you it might be much other thing probably need to be aware of is that by the sounds of it you will have in your app that have since been some may not even be compatible with java beyond you will probably want to upgrade all of these to the latest version as will probably mean more stuff breaking but using apis is just kicking the can down the street and causes you other are exceptions to this where upgrading can have axis1 to axis2 comes to those situations require more careful for what features are all of them pretty i think of any that should be avoided off the top of my i just noticed the size of your actually quite small written an app about that size in the last 3 months by this also depends on how easily you will find things that if you have good unit test coverage then pretty rare if you can just run through the app and reliably find problems not too problematic situations are where scenarios are hard to test and likely you uncover problems straight that calls for more

 is a very good and one not limited to orm always feel important to remember some of the problems that an mapping framework if the rest of the application is based on strong accessing data persistence using objects makes the code just that much more internally and sometimes layer an orm provides a clear layer in your application for db it encapsulates all the functions needed to data in one the epitome of the dry not repeat this makes a few things much because all the select and code is in one spot rather than throughout the because all db access goes through one and because easy to mock out your data models and access if they are clearly while easy to secure raw sql use against injection attacks and even easier if you have an orm framework as a single point of that does it for you so you never have to think about that speed is not on the an orm is a level of indirection between your code and the we certainly hold orm designers responsible for writing a framework that produces good sql but an orm is meant to provide and not executional a developer who has read a basic book on sql will always be able to get better performance talking directly to the are certainly strategies to counter and in django those are as ozan has and but they give you the same performance as a direct sql because of i would never use an orm framework that does not provide some mechanism for issuing a raw sql statement on those occasions when i need for i often resort to raw sql when generating a large report out of the database that joins many the orm way can take the sql way can take said i never start by worrying about each individual my advice for anyone coming to an orm layer nanny the database write your application or and then profile tweaking those areas that truly need the performance or using to reduce the overall of your

 is an appropriate choice to learn a lot more transparent than hibernate and the api is often easier to work much easier to setup and get going as documentation is although it does have a few gotchas does every orm framework if not used with has more features than openjpa and if you are looking to use it on a medium to large commercial product google app then i would certainly choose this more stable than openjpa also least with the version i used only book ever bought on persistence is the christian bauer persistence with covers the basic jpa and hibernate in but a tough read and only really treated it as a reference overall and if you want to learn hibernate in detail then the best place to it is two years old at so there may be other books that are more up to with some tutorials before you buy the book just start by building a simple crud app in either hibernate or openjpa and look at the sql using behind the easily the best way to understand going hope that

 is an interesting question about scaling in a serious are essentially do i establish n connections to an internet where n is only way to do this effectively and efficiently is to you cannot do this on a single so you will need to be able to fragment and partition your client base into a number of different so that each is only handling a idea would be for a single server to hold open as few connections as possible out the connectivity while holding enough connections to make whatever service hosting viable by keeping communication to a minimum this will mean that any two connections that are related as two accounts that talk to each other a will have to be on the same will need servers and network infrastructure that can handle you will need a subnet of ip each server will have to have stateless communication with the internet your router will not be doing any nat in order to not have to track will have to talk to there is no way that aol will be able to handle this level of connectivity without considering cutting your connection any service of this scale would have to be negotiated with aol so both you and they would be able to handle the are multiplexing technologies that you should kqueue and epoll come to order to write this massively concurrent and teleco grade i would recommend investigating erlang is designed for situations such as these telecommunications grade it is currently used for running ericsson telephone

 is an provider for if you have a you can employ two dataadapters to move data from one place to from oracle to from sql to from excel to a dataset from the source with the first then update the destination with the second the dataadapters do not need to be the same type you can use any of etc for the read as well as for the need to fiddle with csv or xml no need to use office so no pias and it works on just connect to use the oledb example string string string outputfilename string top 10 as extracted from products order by string into extracto values void var new var da1 new new new void need to update the row so the da does the foreach r in mark the row as updated to force an var da2 new new is not excel so the caveats that apply to using excel automation on the server do not can start with a existing xls file and just fill in a named this gives you the opportunity to apply formatting and so prior to inserting the ilve in essence the existing xls file is a you can start from nothing and create the xls and the within the xls completely at in this case the xls file will be pretty vanilla no and so

 is as it is right you are literally passing the string as the store a couple more might seem weird that you will be setting why is only the second one being when i first started i had to triple check everytime that i sending or keys evaluated when you are using object notation like so only the second one will be the actual variable it is not correct that you are calling the php file as thinking of the js you have to call it in respect of whatever page has this javascript so if the page is actually in the same directory as the php file you are you might want to fix that to point to the right of tied to the previous you want to get your hands on this will allow you to see ajax requests when they are if they successfully make what data is being sent to and what data is being sent it put the consensus tool of choice to debug your and you should have use and cherish it if you want to waste another 6 days debugging a silly as far as your if you break down what you are is actually an array square containing a single object curly when you try is not correct because the object resides as the first element of the work as you

 is basically a so that should be the basis for the general are some thoughts on fifo buffer of you should have an instance of a queue fifo for each instance of your one thread would receive the data and fill while the other one would read the data in a this only means you would have to use a lock on each queue would enable you to simultaneously process the data in the worker while filling it from the communication if you need to receive lots of you could dequeue data in the worker thread and parse it before all of it has been otherwise you would need to wait until all data has been received to parse it all at in most you know how much data you are supposed to until you start to parse worker thread waiting for would create a worker thread which would wait for a signal that new data has been you could use to have a timeout in case nothing happens for a when the data is you would have to parse based on your current state so that would be an implementation of a port handle different types of you could wrap your serial port inside an which could have at least these methods might have forgotten interface void void event void would help you separate the specific communication code from the state to datareceived event is not guaranteed to be raised for every byte use the bytestoread property to determine how much data is left to be read in the so you could create your own implementation of iport which would poll serialport in regular intervals to ensure that you miss a byte is a question of so which already addresses receiving receive the you would have to attach a handler for the event if not wrapping and enqueue the received data to the queue inside the in that handler you would also set the mentionel to notify the worker thread that new data has been

 is no way to mark or otherwise prevent an image from being zoomed when the user requests could use and detect the zoom amount using one of the techniques described at page zoom in firefox 3 once you know the zoom you could apply that percentage adjustment to the images you want to leave at a fixed whole thing is a house of cards the solution does not detect zoom amount when the page is first so need a flash component on the page just to detect the zoom the actual effect of the zooming will be jarring for the the image resizing will lag slightly behind the zoom causing the page to possibly moving the content they were trying to zoom in on in the first	
 is no way to tell what the problem is without a lot more it could be any number of if the os is xp or earlier then the profile will not be loaded when the service runs so pp may not be able to access some information it pp could be attempting some complex operation that assumes it is in an interactive a com component that pp uses might not be able to initialize due to the lack of user the real error may not even be a security it is not uncommon for developers to use either or as a catch all for unexpected the real issue is that powerpoint is very much a user land application it be used in a setting the service to interact with the desktop is a bad even if it does it will just be masking a deeper as well as making it somewhat pointless to run it as a there are a number of utilities and components that can be used to convert powerpoint slides to image a quick search on google returns many possibilities that look to be much more suitable for use in a service and most of them are quite	
 is normal behaviour for form browsers generally try to remember the contents of text the states of checkboxes and the selected items in dropdowns over events like page reload and this reason you should not assume during script initialisation that the values of your form fields will match the content you served up in the have the script sniff their current values and set its variables and dom state up accordingly when the page you really want to throw away all user form field changes on call in the script initialisation to return it to the html but this can be quite in normal

 is not really correct to ask why python is slower than how fast is naive interpreters are around ten times slower than optimised i believe there is a java bytcode interpreter written in javascript that probably very the intended question appears to be is the cpython language system slower than the equivalent ibm and oracle jre and microsoft believe the correct answer is the fastest java and runtime are faster because they have large full time technical teams developing them in language systems are easy to any idiot can do i static language systems are more complex to design and a simple static system will tend to run much faster than the equivalent dynamic it is possible for highly optimised dynamic systems to run almost as i understand some smalltalk implementation were quite an often quoted example of a developed dynamic system is the lisp addition if the real grunt is being done by library then the language system may not the language may encourage give to develop more efficient algorithms which can easily wipe out constant factor performance hawtin

 is not spammer if someone looks at the code for your site and determines the pattern that you are using for your email then specific code can be written to try and decipher know that i would say it is but it prevents which is quite a big with you simply get that what if you want to copy a relatively complex email address to your address book in you have to resort to typing it out which is prone to the responsibility to the users spam filters is really a poor while i believe that users should be diligent in guarding against that absolve the person publishing the address from that trying to do this in an absolutely secure manner is nearly the only way to do that is to have a shared secret which the code uses to decipher the encoded email the problem with this is that because the javascript is interpreted on the client there anything that you can keep a secret from for email addresses nowadays generally work because most email bot harvesters going to concern themselves with coding specifically for every they are going to try and have a minimal algorithm which will get maximum results payoff worth it because of simple encoders will defeat most but if someone really wants to get at the emails on your then they can and probably easily as since the code that writes the addresses is publically all this into it makes sense that facebook went the image because they can alter the image to make ocr all but they can virtually guarantee that email addresses be given that they are probably one of the largest email address repositories in the it could be argued that they carry a heavier burden than any of and while are forced down that route to ensure security and privacy for their vast user

 is one of those poorly documented aspects of dynamic compilation that cropped up when web sites were first actual answer for your specific question though will require that you tell us more about what exactly you are trying to do with the class from most of the time you just have to worry about the namespace or assembly name to use those classes in your you just use the class name and the compiler will figure it out and hook everything up for biggest exceptions run into with this are when using web controls that put into for those you need a directive in the aspx and for that you need an assembly name and a files in are compiled into an assembly named that this has two not what you can use when you need the assembly name for register directives or in or what as far as i you will not be unable to use a class in register directives or some settings that require a namespace unless you have explicitly wrapped that class in a namespace

 is what successfully worked for my team in the combo of face to face and email code 10 1 big 1 all based physically in same based upon the principal that no one developer owns their own they may be responsible for coding it in the first place but may not be responsible for bug fixing code review process was made easier with visual studio team we could shelve our code and someone else could unshelve the code to review it without having to actually commit the code into the development review we provided a high level over view of how to solve a no code at this talk with fellow developer who is available and development benefits of early design review is getting input that a single developer might have etc if to code changes to another developer for peer review via best bet is to submit it to a developer who was not involved with design note that the reviewer should review the code without input from the original this is we approach it this way for several the code can be understood by someone who has not written it then it is safe to say it is maintainable should the original developer be no longer around to ask the company or or even if they are still the code reviewer cant understand the code then its given back to the developer and makes it more understandable either by greater documentation or refactoring the it could be as simple as adding more information to the bug description that the code change is related this in it self saves so much time in the ability to pick up someone elses code and understand it quickly is very and code reviewer get together and discuss makes changes if reviews in my opinion and very important and advantageous to the development you learn from reading other peoples your skill in reading other peoples code you learn about other areas of a system you are another head with knowledge of how something works therefore another resource to code in that area if its spreading the not easy to sit and listen to someone point out flaws in your code which naturally points people away from code

 it is possible to implement more than one service contract on a wcf service type class that is attributed with the servicebehavior since it is just a matter of having the class implement multiple if you are using any of the visual studio templates or other kinds of code this may not be immediately although you can implement more than one service contract interface on a service it does not do you much good if you need the presumably a singleton in this to behave as one ibusinessservice implies that you need all of the functionality to be callable from one client so that all operations may operate in the same logical session to aspx web if that is not the then you are free to define individual proxies for each contract but that will also require that you support one endpoint for each it an absolute requirement that you can only have on wcf servicehost instance for your what factors are influencing your the partial classes do not trouble me the idea of splitting out code into multiple files now seems rather for storing partial classes in files like and seems natural in addition to storing the core logic in the following question might be of

 it is worth worrying about in md5 is so badly broken that have been able to forge fake certificates that matched a real certificate signed by a certificate this meant that they were able to create their own fake certificate and thus could impersonate any bank or business they felt like with browsers completely trusting this took them a lot of time and effort using a cluster of playstation and several weeks to find an appropriate but once a hash algorithm only gets never if you care at all about it would be better to choose an unbroken hash such as one of the has also been though not broken as badly as md5 the technique used in the link that i provided you involved being able to choose two arbitrary message prefixes and a common from which it could generate for each prefix a block of data that could be inserted between that prefix and the common to produce a message with the same md5 sum as the message constructed from the other i cannot think of a way in which this particular vulnerability could be exploited in the situation you and in using a secure has for is more resistant to attack than using it for digital but i can think of a few vulnerabilities you need to watch out which are mostly independent of the hash you your algorithm involves storing the password in plain text on the this means that you are vulnerable to any information disclosure attacks that may be able to discover passwords on the you may think that if an attacker can access your database then the game is but your users would probably prefer if even if your server is that their passwords not because of the proliferation of passwords many users use the same or similar passwords across information disclosure attacks may be possible even in cases when code execution or privilege escalation attacks are can mitigate this attack by storing the password on your server hashed with a random you store the pair on the and send the salt to the client so that it can compute to use in place of the password in the protocol you this does not protect you from the next an attacker can sniff a message sent from the he can do an offline dictionary attack against the most users have passwords with fairly low and a good dictionary of a few hundred thousand existing passwords plus some time randomly permuting them could make finding a password given the information an attacker has from sniffing a message pretty technique you propose does not authenticate the i know if this is a web app that you are talking but if it then someone who can perform a dns hijack or dhcp hijacking on an unsecure wireless or anything of the can just do a attack in which they collect passwords in clear text from your the current attack against md5 may not work against the protocol you md5 has been severely and a hash will only ever get never do you want to bet that you will find out about new attacks that could be used against you and will have time to upgrade hash algorithms before your attackers have a chance to exploit it would probably be easier to start with something that is currently stronger than to reduce your chances of having to deal with md5 being broken if just doing this to make sure no one forges a message from another user on a forum or then unlikely that anyone will put the time and effort in to break the protocol that you if someone really wanted to impersonate someone they could probably just create a new user name that has a 0 in place of a o or something even more similar using and not even bother with trying to forge message and break hash this is being used for something where the security really then invent your own authentication just use one of the fundamental rules of cryptography is to invent your and then even for the case of the forum where it probably matter all that it be easier to just use something proven off the shelf than rolling your

 its been a few years since done anything with java servlets here so going from would expect the thread safety problem here is in the check for when looking at threading issues the thing one must understand is that a thread can be interrupted between any two machine instructions just any line of that is to that not threadsafe i is shared as i 1 is two an and a the thread can get interrupted between the add and the store and only one of the adds will same thing is occuring in this suppose for a two threads make a request on the same session as goetz suggests from frames or ajax one enters this code successfully retrieves the then attempts to get the since it does not yet null is the thread is then interrupted by another request which does the same it also gets the two requests then proceed in any since both retreived a null reference for the attribute since the cart had not been stored at that both threads will create a new cart object and both will try to store one will loose and those changes to the cart will be thus this code is not for the second half of your i am not familiar with the atomicreference i quickly looked over the java api for atomicreference and it might but not in any the most obvious solution i can think of here is to use a basically what looking to do is have mutual exclusion on the portion of your provided your cart object is atomic we only need to protect the getting and setting of i think something like this could syncronized shoppingcart shoppingcart cart if cart new return session cart i know much about the performance of java monitors so not sure what kind of overhead this would this would have to be the only location where cart is the syncronized keyword means that only one thread can enter the method atomicgetcart at a a lock is used to enforce this lock is simply an object that can be owned by only one thread at a this way you no longer have the race condition that was in the other this

 joel is way off in his and his conclusions and recommendations are not based on any fundamentally he says that you should be able to schedule your work down to units of time of hours or less before you even but the reality is you know what those units of work are all going to be before you get in to the so you come up with an breakdown of what going to do before you even pop the hood and have that breakdown reflect what actually happens with any a project estimate is very difficult if you want that estimate to be of any coming up with accurate estimates is difficult for programmers because very often you discover all the complexities of the project until you get under the the solution to this is to get under the hood when coming up with for smaller projects bug fixes this is fairly the bug on your the code that is causing the out how to write the code that will fix the how long it will take you to write that finding the code you have to write you necessarily must discover most or all the complexities that would have thrown off your interesting thing about this method is that the time it takes to generate the estimate is very often of the total time to actually do the you practically have to do the work in order to come up with an with bug fixes the solution is often on the order of one line of so your estimate will end up being 5 fine because deadlines can be set around estimates like you get practice with this you will get better and better at how long things will at first only be able to how long the smallest projects will but over time you will be able to estimate larger larger

 just a matter of wanting users on the outside to access every property of the grid and every property of the toolbar via xaml then using composition you could create a usercontrol and expose the two controls like problem with this approach is that that users cannot override the layout of the grid and toolbar because it is a user they can however completely override the templates and styles of the toolbar and the slightly better approach would be to create a custom control using you could supply could the grid and the toolbar in the template like class mycustomcontrol private toolbar public toolbar toolbar private datagrid public datagrid grid protected overrides as as

 key thing to realize here is that you have to use just you can use two one you already have which is drawn on hidden map which drawn but which is used for path collision detection natural next question then is where does this second map come you create your own tool which can load your first and display your tool will then let you draw boundaries around you islands and place markers at your these markers and boundaries polygons are stored as your second map and is used in your code to do path finding fact you can have your tool emit python code which creates the graphs and polygons so that you have to load any data am just basically telling you to make a level it very hard to you just need some buttons to click on to define what you are if you are adding a then you can just add each mouse coordinate to an array each time you click on your mouse if you have toggled your add polygon you can have another button for adding cities so that each time you click on the map you will record that coordinate for the city and possibly a corresponding name that you can provide in a text

 kind of depends on how you want to set things definitely the portion of the manual on processes is worth reading the code for package is a good place to listed a pretty limited set of functionality like to which could be solved by a direct you can find helpful utility functions by looking at what is provided in the application trying to connect to has an interpreted connect to as opposed to writing a custom parser on the app emacs from launching emacs from the app opposed to the other way might have made this job this is what probably little perl script to open a socket and to up loop in the interpreter write a custom and connect it to a emacs with function call or specifying the the perl script as a subprocess and the port how or do that anything from emacs could be sent to the perl subprocess and be passed on to your and have the desired effect you can send commands back to emacs by just sending over and have them parsed by functions stuck in then write two little one in your app interpreted and one in to do whatever functionality makes the emacs library should probably be packaged as a major mode depending on what the files are if solely to be used with the a major if a minor mode would be better given that probably want to leverage the write the little perl script in as opposed to simply i know how to interact with if the little perl script could be replaced with a chunk of and still have the benefit using be an added got pretty much the same setup for only the connection stuff is handled by send it works really app from if you launch the app from the above still only you can get rid of the little perl script and just interact through the no sockets still need the loop the app leave tied to the libraries would remain the be much but only works if the user flow enables you to go that a hunch writing this for more than just your being it might be easier to this way from you could add on the socket communication later as an whichever is more

 kinda agree with david on regex matches should not be used as an exclusive criterion to decide if the passed date in the usual procedure in javascript validation involves a few steps the first step is to ensure that the passed string matches date formats by matching it against a the following may be a stricter regex assuming that the only allowed separator is a forward expected the second step is to parse the string into a date object which returns the of milliseconds since use this number as a parameter for the date since js automatically rolls over the passed date to the nearest valid you still cannot be certain if the date object created matches that which was to determine if this the best way is to split the passed string according to the separator and compare individual date d is the created date object as explained arrdateparts return return

 know that line 2 will still point to and have a new string object with the offset and count set to is currently true of the sun jre i seem to recall that was not true of the sun implementation in the and is not true of other implementations of the do not rely on behaviour which is not gnu classpath might copy the array remember off hand what ratio is uses to decide when to but it does copy if the copy is a small enough fraction of the which turned one nice algorithm to line 4 will create a new string in string pool and point to it creates a new string object in the subject to the same garbage collection rules as any other whether or not it shares the same underlying character array is implementation do not rely on behaviour which is not constructor a newly created string object so that it the same sequence of as the in other the newly created string is a copy of the argument constructor a new string so that it represents the sequence of characters currently contained in the character array the of the character are subsequent modification of the character array does not affect the newly created good oo no method of actually requires that it is implemented using a character so no part of the specification of requires operations on an character those operations which take an array as input specify that the of the array are copied to whatever internal storage is used in the a string could use or lz compression internally and conform to the if your jvm make the then a chance that it does copy only the relevant portion when you use so a case of trying it a seeing if it improves the memory not everything which effects java runtimes is defined by obtain a string in the string pool which is to a use the this will either retrieve a string from the pool if one with the value already has been or create a new string and put it in the note that pooled strings have different implementation garbage collection

 least solaris has a limit of 256 file pointers because the structure stores the file descriptor in an unsigned char this is retained for backwards compatibility with some almost impossibly old versions of other platforms tempted to say most other platforms do not share that on the other it is relatively unusual for an ordinary user program to need that many files open it more often indicates a bug closing the files when finished with than having said it can be a problem for things like database servers which need to have lots of data files open at the same comment almost we have a large number of files but the server handles a large number of connections from socket handles and file descriptors seem to come from the same when we have a lot of fails because the call returns and fd are file descriptors at the system call so they come from the same place as regular file descriptors for you have to work around then you need to wrap your current socket opening code so that if it gets an file descriptor in the range then it calls to create a file descriptor in the range that stdio use and then close the original file the only snag with this is that you have to keep track of which file descriptors are because will merrily close the target file descriptor if it is currently assuming your socket code reads file descriptors and not file if the you have bigger problems too many things want to use the same resources and they all use them at the same

 like a bit confused about classes and the thing is one of the gotchas in python for people coming from other programming imo the official tutorial handle it too seems quite ever learnt in python is very similar to in the difference is that python requires you to list as the first argument to every function in a class python is your first programming language your first you could remember this as a simple if defining a function part of a you need to include as the first if defining a function not part of a you include in the you take a class function and make it without doing some possibly a lot extra never include as an argument when a are exceptions to those but not worth worrying about

 lisp implementations have excellent garbage a special problem is that lisp applications often have a high allocation rate of small objects are a few things to conservative not a huge fan of conservative gcs for a problem of conservative gcs is that they find all this can be a problem for long running programs and lead to fragmentation and not reclaimed unused precise gcs are using the tag information of lisp data and can identify every data type of every conservative gcs were invented for programming language implementations that use tagged data compacting to work against memory fragmentation in long running a gc that compacts and localizes objects can be a problem sometimes comes up when hashtables need to be rehashed the location a copying gc may need more memory there is a from and a to space of but when the gc copies the objects from one memory space into it automatically makes it more more advanced gcs on the lisp can also sort objects and allocate objects of the same type near each other assuming that this will speed up accessing this means that there is a first gc stage that exclusively runs in main memory and gets some support from a memory management unit to identify changed memory scanning main memory is fast than scanning virtual memory and scanning only changed memory regions reduces the amount of work when lots of objects are allocated and quickly turning into this gives very short gc usually gcs nowadays are there is more than one generation and objects that survive a few gcs are promoted to an older usually only the first generation is gced very gcs lispworks and allegro cl have a lot of tuning especially for applications it makes sense to read the manual and for example tune the number of their sizes and other gc over virtual memory is usually very avoid that if possible add more ram to the memory for example the web server does some manual memory management using these are pools of objects that can be reinitialized very the lisp machines were using this a typical use of them is in read buffers for instead of creating new strings by every read it is useful to use reusable some common lisp allow stack allocation of some data leaving the block then automatically frees the this assumes then that the memory is no longer referenced on leaving a none of the usual common lisp implementations has a concurrent gc and support for concurrent lisp some implementations have concurrent lisp but the gc will stop them all while it is the if you are not sure where allocation happens and what the gc you need to find that out using profiling your lisp has a precise generational gc which runs in main memory it is hard to get problems with long clozure cl free common lisp for example has a very good gc you want to avoid memory fragmentation and garbage collections in virtual if necessary use a 64bit lisp implementation with more main and configuring the garbage can see from the documentation that lispworks and allegro cl have lots of knobs for tuning lisp has a few functions that deal with the implementation is a function that gives an overview of memory gives more detail 2 generation total size allocated free 725k segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion generation total size allocated free 871k segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space generation total size allocated free 1585k segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion generation total size allocated free 128k segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion size allocated free

 lot of people seem to struggle with the concept of arrays at particularly arrays of a little too getting past that initial block just requires a concrete exploration of the an example used a lot that shows the basic mechanics in a say building a role playing game and you want to keep track of your you could use an array of integers like could be strength could be dexterity could be so add a level of maybe we want to introduce a potion of strength that increases strength by 5 for 10 we could represent the stat side of that by making this into a this is my current this is my normal this is the number of turns until the strength potion wears this is my current so you get the added a 2nd dimension to hold details about the 1st what if i wanted our stats array to handle statistics for more than one i could represent that by making this into a character current character current would be even better to create some constants or enums to eliminate magic numbers from the strength dexterity intelligence currentvalue 0 normalvalue potionturns i could 5 character set the normalvalue of dex to few more thoughts about at least in the world where i most of us have to use them in our lives too often because slowly being relegated to underpinnings for more elaborate data structures like if i were to implement character realistically i would not use still important to get your head around them because they are and there are definitely cases where

 main argument for method 2 is that you get implicit type conversion on both not just the second this might save confusion somewhere down the of your example code defines implicit conversions from int to a and from int to via the constructors on both this could result in ambiguity but if you left out the for fair agree with if you find yourself doing you may be writing an api that others will find how come an a plus a b is an does it really make things easier for users that they are adding a and rather than calling getx themselves and adding the it because users know perfectly well that a and b are wrappers for if then another option is to expose conversions from a to int and b to via operator then will return an int for a sensible and get all the other arithmetic operators a int explicit operator return b int explicit operator return a b a b a b

 makes no sense to do this on an primary key as even if it was trivial to without mass updates in related tables you affect your data to do so you would likely need to drop the index and primary key constraint from the column which point your application may flake renumber all later renumber all related then the primary key constraint and you really must have some form of linear identifier which always starts at 0 may then indicate a problem with the software then you can have a secondary id column in addition to the primary which you then update to shuffle higher values down a rung with a statement such secondaryid secondaryid secondaryid secondaryid from table where primaryid to from primaryid to strongly discourage such a practice if your ids are values because of deleted the software should test for existence of these values rather than just wigging

 managers see the advantages of unit testing until they see it in action where it makes so my based on is to take the ff unit tests to recurring this is the best use case to prove the value of unit when you have bugs that just appear and reappear every other the unit test will allow developers to see which changes caused the aside from alerting them in advance that a fix is in quite easy to demonstrate to management as unit tests to regular with the usefulness of unit tests now clearly several instances of recurring bugs disappearing in the long term should be enough to encourage everyone to use unit tests to evaluate to prevent them from becoming recurring unit tests to new with unit tests making sure that old bugs and confirm that they are fixed in the first the next step would be to apply it to new functionality to ensure that bugs will be make it clear that it is impossible to totally eliminate full blown the final step will be to apply unit testing even before as a design tool that both helps in designing code and minimizing course not saying that this is easy what i had stated above is an oversimplification which even i struggle with everyday difficult to convince later you decide to move on to a different you may want to explicitly look for a company that practices

 me give you an example of the use of nested classes that might clarify when this kind of architecture is i recently needed to generate an html table by pulling selected columns from a data table and them so that rows become columns and vice in my there were two essential pivoting the data and generating some rather complex output was not just showing the each data row was subject to operations for extracting generating image setting up thus using a sql pivot really right an initial attempt to create one class to do the whole i recognized that much of the fell into three distinct header row and i decided that a better approach would be to encapsulate the logic for and into nested this allowed me to separate the data held by each row and program the pivot operations very cleanly a separate row object for each column in your data at the end of the pivot i generated output by calling the header object and then each row object in turn to generate its output back to the main classes appropriate because the nested classes did need some data from the master class and the processing was very specific and not useful just programming one big class was simply messier due to confusion surrounding terms such as and which differed depending on whether you were talking about data or html this was unusual work in that i was generating html in my business class so i wanted to pull apart the pure business logic from the ui in the nested classes provided the perfect of encapsulation and data

 method most sites use for this is to have a script on your site handle the so instead of the link being directly link goes to something script logs the request and then forwards them to the address should be done give them a you to website b in 3 that as a to your i much prefer a method where the destination is apparent when i hover over the as opposed to the method that some sites use where all you see is an what i mean instead of the link being something instead have a link the destination can be achieved in a few one way is something like i described where the destination is part of the query you can use some javascript for the status value can be changed with javascript by setting the but many browsers prevent this by default for has found a sneaky way around this problem by actually using javascript to change the instead of the status when the page is the links in the results list go to their actual but every link has an javascript event that changes the link when you click on you can see this in action by on a after done hovering over the link will now show the true destination in the status bar instead of the real course the information displayed with any method could be a misrepresentation of where actually going to be but i still prefer it over seeing a meaningless id

 might want to be careful of the hippo in the the highest paid opinion is not always a good tended to focus more on providing great tools and support for these done take some of the hassle out of so that it becomes faster and more developers are then more flexible in terms of their and more amenable to testing and deployment are a couple of good ones to start make sure every developer can run up their own software stack in a few seconds and try out ideas developers are then able to make revisions quickly or run down side paths they find and these paths are often the most and by successful i mean measured success based on real metrics gathered right in the system and made readily available to all the owner is then able to set the which they probably care rather than the which they either care about or have no experience in course it depends on the owner and your particular but found that metrics are easier to discuss than and that developers are pretty good at interpreting them a typical problem might be that customers seem to spend a long time filling their shopping carts but go on to a marketing requirement might be to make the checkout button bigger and the requirement might be to take the customer straight to as the ceo only ever buys one item at a time the ui requirement might be to place a second checkout button at the top of the cart as well as the existing one at the the requirement might be some web ajax widget that follows the mouse pointer around the the customer probably saw the ridiculous cost of delivery and ran but redefine the problem as a instead of a and suddenly the developer becomes the developer have to do 10 rounds with the cmo on what shade of red the button should he can play with his web thing all and then rush off the other 3 solutions on monday each one gets deployed live for 48 hours and the gets measured and reported none of it makes any but the developer got to do their job and the business shifts focus onto the crappy products they sell and the price they gauge on so the example is a lot of work in there to make sure that the project is the team is hot deployment is instant rollback is and that on what we wanted to get to is a state where the full potential is not so why involved not just from the but also in the start out with an issue like the number of clicks during registration is too run it through a design and we found that the number of clicks actually went up in the design that was our experience but leave the developer some freedom to just the number of and you might actually end up with a patented as we not that the developer cares about but it had merit and no

 my comments on your is a bad name for what essentially is a layer assigned to abstract i would probably call it or or dao access instead of which is ambiguous and could absolutely mean you really want to decouple your business layer from your your logic layer should only accept interfaces to the and not concrete dal are two schools of thought as to where validation should some are completely fine with validation sitting at the ui others would rather throw exceptions or pass messages from the business whichever way you just be duplicate validations in multiple and be ahead and try coding would probably be the best piece of advice i could give well and fine thinking it but at one point need to see it while coding it and only then will subtle quirks and pitfalls reveal whatever prototypes you can come up with will definitely be valuable to the direction your development and design takes your within the same namespace or calls to concrete classes are definitely i think it will be overly convoluted for you to need to put up interfaces for business logic i mean is there more than one set of rules you should a believer of keeping things simple and following make an interface until there are more than two classes that are going to implementing that interface dal is always an exception to this

 my java ee i have a problem with different users can login to the application and the specified user can see the data for which he is he should not be able to see other user to differentiate we are using as soon as the user logs in we are fetching this from the database and setting it in session like access this session value throughout the application and fetching the relevant data to that this works fine when users work on a single but the problem is there is a who needs to look all the clients under superadmin logs in as and again as superadmin has logged in both times using the same when i refresh the i am seeing the which should not think our application is using the same session for two different logins in the same what would be solution for this i should see the correct data for the particular client when i refresh the can i manage sessions in java

 my this depends on how tightly bound to the component the connections if the connections are to a database that will only be used by the then it make sense to force the users of the component to know anything about those in that keeping the connection strings in a configuration file works or in it might be adequate to keep the connection strings internal to the but to expose the database server name in the config the component is using the same database as the users of the then permit the connection to be passed in as a property of the the component could the choose whether to default to a connection string if the property is not or to throw an exception if the property is not you mind exposing the entire connection string to the then allow the entire string to live in or in use the application settings feature this will cause defaults to be compiled into the yet when the component is these defaults will get written into the they may be edited from you want to limit the parts of the connection string that can be then compile those parts into the expose individual properties for the parts allow to in expose database server application these properties would set the corresponding parts of the connection see the if you already know about

 need to handle a return value of which tells you that the remote host closed the nonblocking you also need to check an error return value and make sure that errno which is definitely need better error handling potentially leaking the buffer pointer to by i you allocate anywhere in this code else made a good point about how your buffer a null terminated c string if your fills the entire that is indeed a and a serious buffer size is a bit but should work as long as you try to read more than 256 or whatever you allocate for worried about getting into an infinite loop when the remote host sends you a malformed message potential denial of service then you should use with a timeout on the socket to check for and only read if data is and bail out if times like this might work for timeval time out after a handle the timeout handle you could try waiting close the the socket is ready for reading call on on the volume of data you expect to the way you scan the entire message repeatedly for the token is very this is better done with a state machine states being so that you only look at each incoming character you should consider finding a library to do all this for not easy getting it

 need to overload operators as others have though this is the approach that offers maximum control because expressions involving objects of type will remain of this alternative is to only overload the mutating operators pre and post pre and post and provide a conversion to constrained as plus overloads for all mutating operator const return any expression involving a object where is and is will be an rvalue of type which is usually more convenient and no safety is because you need to control the value of expression involving a object you only need to check the constraints at a time when a becomes a namely in constructor and in any of the mutating

 not but possibly hard and possibly makes not much is because java is a normal programming as long as you have some way to access the no normally in a modern os the kernel has a layer to allow raw access to hardware in some also already exist drivers in at least the should be no problem to implement in makes possibly not too much because the kernel has to start a jvm to execute the also normally eat up much could also use compiled to be executed natively on the platform with the help of a this is usually not that but it could be suitable for a question does it make sense to implement the driver in or stated in another what is the benefit you hope if you use java for implementing the driver instead of another if you can answer this you should find a way to make it the end the hint to a project that tries to implement a complete os purely based on

 not consider ethics for a consider the you are proposing to do is see section clause 12 of the order of allocation of nonstatic members separated by an is if you have a class with private and a struct with no private the standard does not guarantee that the members will be in the same if your hack it works only by that the compiler writers happened to do it that there is no guarantee that it will work on another a later version of the same or with different class to mention if you have authority to modify the class to provide a simple accessor you probably have authority to object if any implementation detail in the class of the ideas behind public and private is to distinguish what is promised from what is freely the layout may or the member might come to mean something or be removed sutter wrote guru of the column on this as far as the ethics if you really have to do something like and you get out of document it very if your coding standards have some sort of procedure to flag nonstandard use if be very careful to note it in a way it be overlooked when something goes

 not entirely clear about what asking maybe you could provide a little more detail about what you mean by the exceptions being too is it that the error messages themselves are not saxparseexception class does have and methods which you can present to the user to get them to fix the thing that you might experiment with is using different implementations every parser will throw an error when it finds invalid but different implementations may have different error messages and exception for this reason be dubious about trying to build a library which inspects the exception chain and tries to build a more coherent error message out of since be coupling your code fairly tightly to the specific details of an implementation if relying on the specific verbiage of error this more maybe you could give an example of the problem	
 not entirely clear what you but if trying to only add where clauses for the parameters which are you could string query if query if query if query if query return tried and that linq to sql would get confused by the code to find the value of the nullable value you may need to write code like if int querycourseid query worth trying the simpler form first though all this gets a bit a helpful extension method could make life more static where tparameter ret if ret return then use it like string query x x x if query return a higher order function like this could get confusing if not really comfortable with it so if not doing very many queries like this you might want to stick with the longer but simpler

 not even just locking that is the you really want thread two to always print then you need a condition reason is that there is a race regardless of whether or not you create thread 1 before thread it is possible that thread code can execute before thread and so the map will not be initialized to ensure that no one reads from the map until it has been initialized you need to use a condition variable that thread 1 also should use a lock with the as others have because you want threads to access the map as though they are the only ones using and the map needs to be in a consistent is a conceptual example to help you think about you have a linked list that 2 threads are in thread you ask to remove the first element from the list the head of the in thread you try to read the second element of the that the delete method is implemented in the following make a temporary ptr to point at the second element in the make the head point at then make the head the temporary if the following sequence of events removes the heads next ptr to the second t2 tries to read the second but there is no second element because the next ptr was completes removing the head and sets the 2nd element as the read by t2 failed because t1 use a lock to make the delete from the linked list is a contrived and necessarily how you would even implement the delete it shows why locking is it is necessary so that operations performed on data are you do not want other threads using something that is in an inconsistent this

 not good with but if what doing is just replacing external urls not part of your with an internal url that will track and redirect the then it should be easy to construct a regexp that will match only external say your domain is then you just need to create a regexp that will only match a hyperlink that contain a url starting with as i pretty bad with but my best stab at you want to track to internal urls as then just replace with the url of your walk through an example scenario just to show what talking say you have the below ipsum dolor sit consectetur adipiscing donec lacus ipsum quisque sagittis sodales mauris dictum blandit consequat the purpose of this the search pattern will only match links that begin regexp can be broken down into 3 the first pass of the the script will link satisfies all 3 components of the so the url is stored in the database and is replaced with the second pass of the the script will link matches 1 and but not so the search will move on to the next link satisfies all 3 components of the so it the url is stored in the database and is replaced with the 3rd pass of the the script will examine the first 2 skip and then find a match with the last link in the

 not possible since assigning it to a derived class reference would be like saying class is a fully capable substitute for derived it can do everything the derived class can which is not true since derived classes in general offer more functionality than their base class the idea behind could write a constructor in the derived class taking a base class object as copying the like class base public int public void do stuff with class derived base public int public otherdata default public void do some other that case you would copy the base object and get a fully functional derived class object with default values for derived this way you can also avoid the problem pointed out by jon b new d new also new copy construct a derived with values of now

 not sure what you are build and what is the but as a general rule of thumb i do not consider this a grievous security lets look at the attack in the middle attack on the http text traffic an especially one obfuscated against ocr will prevent this but also simply using https as pornel scraping by a remote desktop application https protection will not nor an image as the mess on a screen has to be read by a human anyway human attacker can also circumvent your obfuscated image protection against in the by instructing the listener to archive the image and then go over them if a human is behind the screen then you have no your shoulder eavesdropping if the attacker is simply standing behind the then again you have no note that if your password is then you must show it to the there is no way around one way sites try to mitigate the threat is to send the password by email under the assumption that a user can make sure they read the email when no one is at their own unfortunately email will not even let you have the benefit of encryption to protect the my the best way is to let the user input the password a password obfuscation like normally it is and then only store the hash of the password so you need not store the actual preventing you from showing it to the if you must show it to the user because you are generating then make sure you are over https and just show it all the fanfare just complicates the implementation without giving any security

 not technically an so maybe missing could someone spell out the tradeoffs of is it really faster to learn and understand jquery syntax than to just learn is more than another to it allows you to express yourself in ways that are more compact and succincter than the corresponding javascript at the same clearer and much more the benefits you get jquery is essentially a dsl for dom manipulation and this specificity is a major source of its utility and to a very large jquery is run even in this is still a surprisingly rare feat for gratifying and relieving to know that you have to waste time debugging obscure problems on ie6 most of the complete as a i prize apis and frameworks that have taken the time to spell out what all the moving pieces are supposed to be nothing is more encouraging than knowing that things are stable enough that writing documentation an attempt to hit a moving target and things are useful enough that attracted enough people to flesh out the documentation the difference between javascript and jquery is analogous to the difference between assembly and programming although both technically both interface to machine and can both do similar the latter is considered far more powerful because of how easy it is to represent things and develop

 noticed deepzoomcomposer supports a element which you can use in your silverlight multiscaleimage control by tag are also right that you would any information you add to the xml file when you edit in deepzoomcomposer and you lose it if you typed into get around this written a little console application called basically it like put your metadata in the jpg file format supports lots of different but for now use keywords description and add your images to deepzoomcomposer necessarily bother laying them since you will probably want to sort them and bother entering any and as via the console will have generated the extracts the metadata from your and updates it is destructive to the existing but otherwise the file can be used to provide metadata information for a deepzoom collection in a multiscaleimage and zoom composer of the thunder can keep adding because the metadata is coming the images the deepzoomcomposer tag notice how the tags and description on the right are updated as you hover over each as well as the visible images being filtered based on clicking a source can be modified to use this extra tagstring get new elements as descriptionstring titlestring ratingstring of some interest tagupdater itself the only way to accomplish pretty it just opens the loops through the elements to open the extract the add the additional xml elements and save the using the filename as a you could get additional information from a database a price or more description and expand the xml file as much as you

 number of a series of a 32 bit unsigned int is 32 binary the string is a series of 5 digits can be stored in many as array elements and so the largest datatype in with complete precision is probably the decimal type just choose your own method of storing digits that allows you to store much bigger for the this will give you a sum of digits of is in 4875 sum of digits of is in 51 sum of digits of is in 2 algorithm and solution in as alluded to a number is nothing more than an array of this can be represented easily in two a an array of characters or others have storing the digits in reverse order is actually it makes the calculations much i tried both of the above i found strings and the character arithmetic irritating easier in the syntax is just plain annoying in first thing to note is that you can do this with one you need to allocate more storage at each as mentioned you can find a power of 2 by doubling the previous power of so you can find by doubling 1 one thousand the doubling can be done in place with the general digit in sum digit digit if sum 10 carry sum carry end digit algorithm is basically the same for using a string or an at the end you just add up the a naive implementation might add the results into a new array or string with each bad really slows it as it can be done in how large should the array well easy mathematically you can convert to where is a simple logarithmic conversion and the number of digits you need is the next higher integer from that power of for you can just required of 2 is a close approximation and you can really optimise this is by using larger a 32 bit signed int can store a number between 2 billion well 9 digits equals a billion so you can use a 32 bit int or as basically a base one billion you can work out how many ints you create that array and all the storage you need to run the entire algorithm 130ish with everything being done in follows fairly rough static void const int limit int ints limit number new for i i string text sum of digits of limit is static void int carry for i i if carry carry static string int i while 0 string ret while ret return	
 number of features were introduced into which made me such as object extension methods and implicitly typed now in with things like the dynamic keyword getting even more know that each of these features be used in appropriate ways in my view they make it easier for developers to make bad coding decisions and therefore write worse it seems to me that microsoft are trying to win market share by making the coding easy and personally i prefer a language that is rigorous and places more demands on my coding standards and forces me to structure things in an oop are a few examples of my concerns for the features mentioned constructors can do important logic that is not exposed to the this is in the control of the object object initializers take this control away and allow the consumer to make the decisions about which fields to i had not appreciated that you can mix constructor and initializer but this starts to look messy to my mind and so i am still not convinced it is a step developers to extend types using extension methods allows all and sundry to start adding their favourite pet methods to the string which can end up with a bewildering array of or requires more policing of coding standards to weed these implicitly typed variables allows quick and dirty programming instead or properly oop which can quickly become an unmanageable mess of vars all over your my worries do you deal with new features of so that they lead to poorly written

 of the confusion between various cocoa references comes from the introduction of views in on the all uiviews are where in leopard views need to manually enable a content is drawn once using whatever you supplied in but then is buffered into the the layer acts like a rectangular so when you move the view or cover no redraw is the texture is just moved to that location via the unless you set the to for a changing the size of the layer its containing will simply scale the this may lead to blurry graphics within your view or so you may want to force a redraw in this will trigger a manual redraw of the or and a subsequent recaching of that content in the optimal suggested that you avoid having frequent calls to because quartz drawing and recaching in a layer are expensive best to try to do animation using separate layers that you can move around or references seen that relate to the desktop may assume which do call any time the view needs to be whether from or having part of the view as i all uiviews are so this is not the case on the for your drawing one way to do it would be to maintain an array of drawn objects and call each time the user adds something iterating over each of the previously drawn objects in i might suggest an alternative approach where you create a new uiview or calayer for each drawing the contents of that drawing operation would be drawn by the individual view or that you have to redraw everything on a new and you might be able to do some neat editing by moving each of the drawn elements around independently of the for complex there might be a bit of a memory tradeoff in but bet that it would have much better drawing performance cpu usage and

 of the optimizations you listed are practically irrelevant these days for c programmers the compiler is better at performing things like loop loop loop and strength versus for they generate identical machine so which one you use is a matter of in objects can overload those and postincrement in which case usually preferable to use a because a postincrement necessitates an extra object for using shifts instead of multiplications by powers of the compiler already does that for depending on the it can do even more clever such as turning a multiplication by 5 into a single instruction on with divisions and moduli by powers of you might need to pay a little more attention to get the optimal suppose you y and are signed the compiler turn that into a right shift because it will yield an erroneous result for negative so emits a right shift and some bit twiddling instructions to make sure the result is correct for both positive and negative if you know and are always then you should help the compiler out and make them unsigned integers the compiler can optimize it into a single right shift modulus operator works similarly if modding by a power of with signed integers the compiler has to emit an instruction plus a little more bit twiddling to make the result correct for positive and negative but it can emit a single instruction if dealing with unsigned

 on published by google engineers henry shumeet and yushi it seems the most important implication of your question about recognizing colors in images relates to algorithm for pictures that can detect without any text around paper begins by describing by describing the which are typically based on normalizing color brightness and then using a or using a histogram built up using the rgb values in pixels color is a 8bit integer value from representing how much of that color is included in the methods have also been introduced that rely on properties such as incorrectly called which is the density of luminous intensity to the naked eye from a given google paper mentions that they will need to process roughly images with their algorithm so it needs to be as efficient as to achieve they perform the majority of their calculations on an roi of which is a rectangle centered in the image and inset by of the image dimensions on all once determined the they have many different algorithms that are then applied to the image including color constancy and which as a whole find in the coloring and most importantly the color shades with the highest frequency in the statistical use other features such as entropy and to order to extract lines from the they use the opencv implementation of the probabilistic hough transform et computed on the edges of the skin color connected which allows to find straight which are probably not body parts and additionally allows them to better determine which colors are most important in an which is a key factor in their image color more on the technicalities of this topic including the math equations and read the google paper linked to in the beginning and look at the research section of their web interesting question and

 once heard a saying something like your class is getting too big and too then refactor it into a couple or a few smaller would strongly suggest you take something along this approach until you are more this will allow you to really get a feel for when functionality needs to be broken if you try to your project without any experience to guide then you are sure to make lots of i found that some people get so caught up in the principles and practices they start implementing designs that are very by speculative i mean that they might think later on we might want to add robust so they design everything to support the anticipated features list quickly grows and you will find yourself designing for all kinds of you will run into problems like do i get this particular class to both be compatible with my future authentication service and my future monitoring you will bang your head against the wall trying to solve problems which are not even relevant to your first you take my advice it is important that after you get a prototype up in that you then take a serious look at your now is the time that you can look at larger and ask yourself if they make one test is to imagine how easy it would be to explain the usage of the class to someone if it is complex or then a redesign may be in if they are too big and serving more than one then breaking it apart is probably important thing to remember about design practices is that certain techniques should only be applied where try to force your application into a certain architecture or design if it fit you will learn these things with experience and the best thing you can do is spend too much time over thinking if you dive right you will find plenty of opportunities to reflect on your you obviously have the right mindset already of trying to do things the which is just over do are lots of and out

 only agile projects i have ever worked on were either in time and materials or pay per cycle trouble as you have pointed that there is a risk of a project that the same as any if you go you take all the if you go fixed price the customer takes all the by going pay per cycle you are taking most of the but are passing small chunks of it onto the customer one cycle at a as it happens neither you or the client want to take any risk at which is why you have posted this trouble is taking risks is what business is all the more risk you take the bigger the profit when it comes but also the bigger the loss if it if the risk is too great for you to handle the only solution is to find someone else that can take the risk off your but you are going to have to pay if neither you nor the client are prepared to take it then there are probably only two some rich fool to underwrite the risk get the risk out amongst a number of people until the risk each one takes is so small that it is think this second option is what makes contactors so because they are easy to get rid they end up taking the risk of an early project as the risk would be spread between a number of the risk is spread to an acceptable they will charge you more than an employee because of the extra but that is what you get for trying to avoid the risk

 only end up with five items if returns thats the simple answer to your but i see other problems wondering why you have this is that array the same thing as you really need to be using the same array for both not a syntax but you use the property syntax for things that declared as you should write also confused by the code you use to set up the cells are meant to be that you create one then reconfigure it every time in your implementation of your code creates a cell for each item in your this is very and will likely crash your program due to insufficient memory on the iphone if you keep lots of cells in memory like recommended approach is to call if that returns then you set up a cell using the the table view is very and will only ask you to redraw the cell when it needs you dictionary looks really shaky to what if you insert an item after the item with key all the items with key onward will need to be shifted one element to the right to work the way you a ton of bookkeeping that seems rather unnecessary to if you really needed something like this and to be i think you do why you use an which is much easier to

 other answers talk about how to either avoid recursion or how to use tail or how to simply set a larger stack i think for completeness that worthwhile to consider memory usage patterns answer to allow more memory on lots of of many programmers will allocate buffers inside the recursive and reallocate new buffers when the function is called if return int use return this is a throwaway i bother worrying about invalid input values larger than and i will assume somebody asking a question about programming either knows how to do that or is smart enough to find important point here is that takes up 400 bytes a 32 bit 800 bytes on a 64 bit of the stack each and every time is so if is called recursively 100 then bytes bytes on a 64 bit of stack space are being used for and very likely you can modify the function to reuse the same buffer on each int if return use buffer to avoid int return course you could instead use a which handles some details for you to protect you against memory leaks and buffer overruns for the keeps the data on the heap meaning it will likely use less stack or even 80k may not seem like much but things can add if the function have many other variables then this can dominate stack space if it for the extra space the buffers take up you may be able to call the function far more may seem it does come even in nonrecursive buffers always obvious as they may be strings or for stl such as arrays put all their data on the they actually take a template argument to specify the memory allocation just that the allocator they use by default puts the data on the obviously unless you specify an allocator that somehow puts the data on the the end result will be the using stl containers will probably use less memory than using stack allocated arrays or say because although the data is kept on the heap somewhere the container can only access that data through pointers it keeps if the container is on the stack then those pointers will reside on the and those pointers take up so a one or two element may actually take up more space on the stack than the corresponding

 overloading is pretty essential for a lot of functors would be impossible to create without the ability to overload programming would in many cases become a pain in the if i write a numerical i rely on the value type behaving the same whether a or some i rely on the usual arithmetic operators being and so i have to write a separate overload for and another for custom pointers rely on objects being able to overload the dereferencing operator so that they can behave like overloading is extremely important for making programming for it being i just see no more complicated than creating your own which people generally find fairly if you name it it is a if you name it an but the code in the body is the exact course operators sometimes get and or may be borderline but so commonly known and used that i think asked about operator overloading in something like gladly do without their implementation is much more they work with and they enable all the nice and convenient tricks that

 packing is so perhaps your failure to understand it is because you imagine it is more complicated than it is either vertical a pile of or horizontal a queue of each element in that layout can expand or it can not for a horizontal layout with two which the code would since the default for packing is to have both those buttons added to the box will expand and they will each occupy half the no matter what the size of the container i think of this as widget widget if you want one of the buttons to not you will pack it like widget the button will only occupy the space it needs to draw text borders shadows images and the other button will expand to fill the remaining buttons need to be so a more situation is a textarea which you would want to expand to fill the other parameter that can be passed to is the fill and normally this can be it is enough here to say that if then the parameter is entirely ignored it make sense in that other thing you mentioned is i would generally say that this is not a good i say because there are situations where you will need to use but for someone beginning out with packing a user i would strongly recommend not using in let the boxes and other containers handle your layout for the does not do exactly what you would expect it to it does not change the size of a but merely how much space it will it may use and may even stretch to fill larger it will rarely become smaller than the but again because it is just a there is no guarantee theat the request will be

 part of a large automation we are calling a api that does some work calling services on another we discovered recently that every so often when the other machine is the api call will spin away sometimes up to 40 minutes while attempting to connect to the remote api using offer a way to specify a timeout and we want our program waiting around for that so i thought threads would be a nice way to enforce the the resulting code looks something thread new if throw new attempting to i want to let but if it is still going after timeout has assume it is going to kill it and move new to threading in and on the runtime i thought ask two related there a appropriate mechanism in the libraries for what trying to and have i committed any threading gotchas in that bit of reasonable use of threading in

 performance breakdown seemed to be caused by the high number of blocks in the for every message received i was creating a adding that run to a paragraph and adding the paragraph to the changed the algorithm so now it creates a paragraph then adds 250 runs to that then creates a new paragraph adds 250 runs and so this essentially cuts the number of blocks in also has an added benefit when i reach the max number of lines instead of deleting a single line for each new line added pegging the i can just delete the oldest paragraph and that instantly deletes the oldest 250 relatively simple change brought the performance well within the acceptable instead of pegging the cpu and locking up the now the cpu stays relatively low with spikes around

 pointer arithmetic and relative comparisons are defined only within to be confused with an is a variable any or a memory area allocated with you can compute a pointer to the and this will always work in a standard conforming at things at a lower a pointer is typically implemented as an the size of the integer is large enough to hold the address of any memory the only way for a pointer to overflow is if you exceed the address and that is impossible to do while conforming to the c if you are writing and ignoring the restriction that pointer arithmetic is only valid within an the best way to do this is to take advantage of the knowledge of how pointers are in most modern this then becomes the same thing as checking for overflow with unsigned integer to that will be things like segmented memory of the 8086 or multics and probably other things i may have suppressed from my memory my

 probably looking at the tag wrapping option inside the text editor html options under the text editor you can either disable it altogether or extend it beyond the 80 character there is still some level of code reformatting that happens behind the scenes when you drag new controls into the page that i found any solution to other than just staying in the text editor as much as good things to vs2k8 does a much better job that vs2k5 when it comes to formatting with the new intellisense built into it makes it really easy to stay in the text editor while adding i think i do most of my html stuff there you can keep your display in and just refresh every now and then to see how your controls are coming

 probably talking about the amount of memory it takes to represent the class or the allocating an object requires a minimum of 16 on a the minimum object size is 24 if looking at it purely from the amount of memory a struct that contains less than 16 bytes of data will be than the corresponding the amount of memory used is not the whole value types are fundamentally different than reference types structs can be inconvenient to work and can actually cause performance problems if not real of is to use whichever works best in your in most be much better off using	
 probably the easiest to follow and make use of what tpersistent i somehow prefer this so i keep full control over the structure of the be who knows what 64bit delphi does to your of in mind that seems to be treated like so if you use delphi your unicode strings will be changed into ansistrings when you at least files will be exchangable with software compiled with older versions of tsmall change the integer for age to so that you get in trouble with 64bit bits should be enough for 2009 wouter van	
 probably used hash tables which are but have a the trade off is by the time you reach the end of the book you will know your incrementing counters for each word is fast of the quick hashtable other end of the spectrum is to look at the first then go through the entire book to see how many times that word this requires minimal then you do the same for the next word and go through the entire if that word occurs more you add that as the top word top n of this is extremely the first and third word are the same end up going through the whole book again even though you just did the same thing for the first

 problem is that actually do any boundary checking with regards to it depends on the os to ensure that you are accessing valid this particular you are declaring a stack based depending upon the particular accessing outside the bounds of the array will simply access another part of the already allocated stack space and threads reserve a certain portion of memory for as long as you just happen to be playing around in the stack everything will not crash i did not say happening on the last line is that you have now accessed beyond the part of memory that is allocated for the as a result you are indexing into a part of memory that is not allocated to your process or is allocated in a read only the os sees this and sends a seg fault to the is one of the reasons that is so dangerous when it comes to boundary	
 problem is that nsnumber objects are meaning that you cannot change their so in order to change a value you have to create a new nsnumber of course you have mynumber point to different object than the one you added to the so you have to update the array by replacing the changed nsnumber this leaves you with the problem that you have to store the index together with each nsnumber in order to be able to update the which is incovenient if you want to pass the nsnumber object around and allow changing the could solve this problem by introducing a wrapper object that you wrap around nsnumber in order to allow transparent updates or you just could create your own class that handles your doublevalue a mutable nsnumber	
 problem is that only the that are visible have been created wpf does not create all items up front to the length of time that could take for large i would better approach would be to create a data structure that mimics the structure of your tree and use data binding to tell the how to display that i can write up a simple if based on your that will only work if the ui item has been created for that which take a look at the interface by calling i believe that has a method that will return the ui container for a given data that will only work if the ui container has been previously	
 problem is that the marker and the so never achieve what you are trying to do using so only choice is your issue is that some lists can have up to 9 items others have up to 99 items and still others have up to 999 items i would say that you have 2 create a different class for each list you know the count ahead of maybe call them so for 1 digit you would abandon lists altogether and just use tables know but you would guarantee proper wrapping and indentation no matter how many items are in the

 problem is that you are trying to join to the table but you really need to join to the table and from each of these to the respective row in the of as referring to a in a not the table that idea helped me to understand complex joins a lot how write that as message join u on join r1 on join tag t on join r2 on join tag x on in by by 0 should develop the habit of using syntax mixing and joins can cause some subtle an alternative that pulls some of the joins into a so you avoid a cartesian product between and and eliminate the modifiers in the group as message join u on join r on join tag x on any select from message m2 join r2 on join tag t on where in group by having by by 0	
 problem is that your first replace string is going to be matched by the second search effectively overwriting the first replace string with the second replace you can somehow differentiate links from the original ones so that they get caught by the other expression by adding an extra html i think you can really solve this with a single one possible solution from the differentiation in the regular that comes to mind would be to use since it will give you an array of matches to work you could probably then encode the matched urls with your tracking url by iterating over the array and running a on each matched

 problem seems to be that the system recover sufficient memory even after a full garbage this also has the negative effect of promoting objects to tenured and survivor spaces that really belong size of the old generation should settle down over most objects are at least should very short if you find that the old generation keeps growing then there may be a resource leak from your graph it seems like some allocation is tipping the system over the edge and into a gc death to get the an idea of what objects are being more how long they are hanging this will give you the best idea of where you should be

 processor operates what is known as a machine code instructions are fairly they do all that much in a single for adding two numbers would have a sequence of instructions with semantics a pointer to the address of operand 1 into register the value stored at the address stored in register 1 into register a pointer to the address of operand 2 into register the value stored at the address in register 1 into register the contents of register 2 and register 3 and store it in register a pointer to the destination into register the contents of register 4 in the address specified in register the processor is a special set of fast memory known as a which contains the memory that the processor uses to store data that it is working on at the the register file has several which are uniquely instructions typically work on especially on risc while this is not always the case it is a good enough abstraction for the a processor has to load or store data into a register to do anything with operations such as arithmetic work on taking the operands from two registers and placing the result into a third the benefit of the peanut i used a 6502 lets not confuse the issue the processor has special instructions for loading or storing data from registers into the main processor has a special register called the that stores the address of the next operation to the sequence for executing an instruction goes roughly the instruction stored at the current address in the program the picking apart the actual what registers it the it works out where to get or store and some other bits and the the instruction will change the values in various for a instruction will copy a value into a an arithmetic or logical will take two values and compute a a jump or branch instruction will change the address at the program counter so the processor starts to fetch instructions from a different processor can have special an example of such is the program counter described another typical one is a condition flags this will have several bits with special for example it may have a flag that is set if the result of the last arithmetic operation was this is useful for conditional you can compare two if they are the flag is the processor can have a conditional instruction that is only executed if this flag is this you could decrement a counter in a register and if it was a condition flag is a conditional on can be used for a loop where you decrement a counter and exit the loop if the result of the decrement instruction is on some processors the arm all instructions are with a special condition for examples of typical processor instructions or decrement a or store the contents of a register into you can also have the address to load or store offset by the contents of another this allows you to easily loop over an array of data by incrementing the other logical operations to calculate these take operands from two registers and place the result in a to another location this moves the contents of the location into the program counter and starts to fetch instructions from the new or pop values onto a stackoverflow has an example of a small snippet of compiled c code and the assembly language output from that it should give you an example of the sort of relationship between a language and the machine code output that it compiles best way to learn this is to get an assembler and try it this used to be much easier on simpler computers like micros of the the closest thing to this type of architecture available these days are embedded you can get a development board for an embedded processor like a microchip pic fairly as this type of architecture has less baggage than a modern operating system there is less and to use system this will make it easier to bootstrap an assembly language program on this type of the simpler architecture is also easier to option is to get an emulator such as this will emulate a cpu and let you assemble and run programs on the advantage of such an emulator is that they will also have facilities for single stepping programs like a and showing the contents of the register this may be helpful in gaining insight as to actually going

 propositioning nhibernate for a project doing at my company and like to know if nhibernate can be optimized to only retrieve specific columns on a table when using the criteria query say i have a table with 30 columns on it and this is mapped to an object using nhibernate that is a match against the for a particular function of the system i only care about two of those i know i can use hql and do a createquery that will accomplish this but that requires i create a constructor for each combination of fields like to selectively this could be a huge pain from a maintenance standpoint since i catch missing constructors till like the criteria query language since it produces parametrized sql instead of straight sql queries from i see there is an model for not including certain columns but in most cases i will include more columns than to the comment below i looked into projections and this still quite the ideal situation for when using the var list end up with the variable just being prefer to have my full task object but with all the fields set to their default is this even everything i see so far says only retrieve specific columns when using critera

 pure using an int as your primary key is better simply due to the support for comparison of ints at the machine code strings are compared using algorithms implemented at the database unless your strings are very an integer key will take up less space on the page as well based on the other answer now on the not sure if understood your question are you asking whether it is better to use an integer as your key compared to a string either could be or are you asking whether your type should match your database assuming the would be very surprised if it is the latter whose answer i would think is lieven has now clarified his request to say that he in asking whether an int or an nchar field would be better as an index so my original take on this question was add to my it is almost always better to have an int as your the exception is when there is a key that can be captured as a short character string in an accounting system where entries are char the reasons are integers are represented as a native machine type or and manipulated via operations whereas strings are not but must be compared using a for when traversing the pk index some variant of a to locate a the comparison operation at each node is a single is this a huge probably not unless you are working with a truly massive database or transaction if you have a natural character key by all use if your is the first five letters of the last name plus the first initial plus a number to make it then obviously be far better off with an int integers simply take up less room than almost any char key assuming the use of and it just the room in the main table remember that the index fields are represented in the index as is this a big not unless you working with a massive our choice of keys often has effects for if you use the primary key on one table as the foreign key on both of the above effects are magnified when you are inserting or updating records in the table using the foreign use the key that is most if you have a choice between int and char and both are essentially go with the int over the	
 purpose with typedef is to hide the implementation but the pointer property hides too much and makes the code harder to please do not do you want to hide implementation details often is a good thing to do not hide the pointer take for instance at the prototype for the standard char const char int file fopen returns a to some structure you do not know the implementation details maybe is not such a good example because in this case it could have worked with some pfile type that hid the fact that it is a char const char int pfile that would only work because you never mess around with the content that is pointed to the moment you typedef some pointer that you some places modify the code becomes very hard to read in my

 question is a bit inserting data validating make you want to know how to insert well a basic mysql question which is probably best answered by consulting the you want to know how to validate the going to have to specify the kind of validation you sanders has sort of like asking do i make a there are infinite ways you can do the question is too you just want to check to see if the value submitted is a valid a quick and dirty way of doing it is just to insert it into the table you have a column of the then make a query to retrieve the value if the stored value is that data value or then the submitted value was not a valid your code would look something into values from where submitted date was there are many drawbacks to the above you probably want to validate the data you insert and if you are updating a record rather than inserting a new then you will need to fetch the original value before it is overwritten with an invalid i think you meant to say or a menu is something	
 question is a follow up to my question about resources between web because i have not yet found a good have a web application with user controls and resources that are shared by three other web is what i know this can not compile commoncontrolswebapp into a single dll since i am creating user this is only possible with custom server where everything is in the so i need a way to share the ascx files between the four the files from commoncontrolswebapp into the three other projects does not update their files in the solution i would have to exting all in all three webapps when a file is added or renamed in to the web site model would remedy but i am worried about the compile time for if i do as does not work for could use subversion to share the files between the but i believe that this would require me to check the files in and out again all the time if i am developing a user control that i have to test through one of the it really be true that does not have a good solution for how are you guys organizing large web thanks a lot for all the i am going to copy my user controls with a build event for and then see if we have time to refactor them into server do i share user controls between web applications in

 question is how does one abstract a database connection from the model layer of an the primary concern is to be able to easily change from different types of maybe you start with a flat then you want to move to a sql then later you decide an ldap implementation would be how can a person easily plan for something like a simple say you have a user with a first last and a very simple php class representing it might look like this ignore the problems with public instance user public public public have frequently seen where people have a dao class which has the sql embedded in it as userdao public public public public public function into user problem with strategies like this is when you want to change your you have to change every dao delete functions to deal with your new type of even if you have a program to them for you i am not particularly a fan you would have to edit this program to make it work are your suggestions for how to handle current idea is to create a super class for dao objects with its own load these functions would take arrays of the attributes of the dao and generate the query in this the only sql is in the superdao class rather than being scattered about several then if you wanted to change your database you would only have to change how the superdao class generates the foreseeable the the and the the best way to abstract the database from a php	
 question is more of an architectural less involved with the actual have build an api based on but really decide on how to separate the pl from the i have made my service so that it holds only a minimum of something tagitemresponse return of course the first question in what layer do the requestprocessors i think it would be wrong to call them a but at the same they have nothing to do with as for i decided that they nevertheless belong in the the processor methods take my as validate the request message authenticate and eventually return a single dto like override void tagitemresponse host var profile var item var tags new foreach name in var tag i ask why do i need the facade classes related to my business for example i have a hostfacade that acts as a layer between the hostdao and the holds very little it merely handles the dao static host return i might as well merge the processors and the read many on the but i still settle on the way to go and tend to chose a different approach every time i face the i wonder if a right approach even found the dofactory where they talked to the dao classes right from within the service i really like as most servicecontract methods share some and thus lend themselves well for use with shared base also found other examples where only the facades are called from within the but that seems to work well only for very my messages are and composite in order to reduce the number of calls to the service as much as my extra processing layer seems the be my real there is no single answer as to how to correctly layer a wcf but hopefully there are some of you out there with an opinion that will either conform my instincts or shed some new light on the subject for a wcf service the right way

 queuing solutions like mq series or msmq are used extensively for integrating distributed enterprise especially running on different done right persistent asynchronous design rather than over and attention to operational this gives you compared to synchronous integrations such as rpc or boilerplate web services availability is the product of the respective integrating ten systems with 99 availability synchronously gives you a combined availability of no more than 90 or worse if just one weak mind this requires the message queues to have high availability in we use our mainframe for that purpose a guess at which product brokers and are a more complex kettle of they can add between different content representations encodings and code detecting when a target system does not pick up queued messages and raising alarms or automatically restarting when systems do not the same and represent customer or product records this can in principle help you deploy new versions at different to and including to decouple a sending system from knowledge of the details of thus reducing impact of changes in target where you can coordinate messages between a number of systems to track a longer business process from customer order to delivery to listed these functionalities in roughly increasing order of difficulty potential the higher you the more mature your organization the business needs to be in order to gain the

 reads the file in the current line of the file is stored in basically the same as technically it expands to but very close to the same thing either so you need to worry about with no arguments is equivalent to it splits the current line into a list of items between so it splits the current line into a list of words or and stores this list in an this line is should be qualified with perl would catch this if you have and at the push pushes a reference to an anonymous array containing the elements that were in into which is an array of arrays you probably already in the you have a list where each element in the list corresponds to a line of the and each element of the list is another list of the words on that should be declared using and you should and in as has been you could do away with push using a temporary array may be nicer on anyone who has to add to this code i missed the regex you wanted to last unless push catch all integers it match if you want it to match negative use if you want to match you could use but i know if you want to match these regexes will match invalid entries like and which are not integers or if you want to be more strict about try my this line for floating last loop unless this line for just last loop unless push

 really all across the on one end of the worked in one place where the code was recently rewritten in recently being 10 years everyone was highly skeptical of this farther down the find c programmers who happen to have compilers with features dabble in the but other than they are practically writing in down the line i think find those who just groked inheritance and these are the kind of guys and gals that would swoon over an mfc or wxwidgets thinking it was the go a little farther and find the folks who just read they are all about figuring out how to use stl got a basic notion of templates that equates mostly to the way stl uses got the modern template metaprogramming many of us these days use their work in the form of boost and all its few actually dork around with template probably a good have seen perfectly good code written at each cool thing i always liked about is that at each level of added the cost could be conceptualized in terms of this new abstraction might be implemented in so i can conceptualize that inheritance and polymorphism is adding the cost of a function pointer since i have seen this and written this in i know what in i also have a sense of how templates work in part because of how the preprocessor works in this applies to most features in the and c easy to map concepts to how they are implemented in i can easily visualize how the underlying architecture runs my

 really depends on who the design document is targeted if for a boss who is then you are good with what you for then you are using the tool to help so you i create method level design docs when i am creating a but at a high level so i can figure out what the features of the various classes should found that across the primary functionalities of a class have little to do with the programming language we are working some of the internal details and functions required vary due to the chosen but those are implementation details that i bother with during the design certainly helps me to know that for instance an authorization class might have an authenticate function that takes a user object as a i really care during design that i might need an internal string md5 function wrapper to accomplish some specific i find out about that while goal of initial design is to get organized so you can make progress with clarity and forethought rather than tearing out and reimplementing the same function 4 times because you forgot some scenario due to not i work in php a and i actually use phpdoc to do some of the design by simply writing the method signature with no then putting a detailed description of what the method should do in the method header this helps anyone that is using my class in the because the design is the i can also change the documentation if i do need to make some alterations while work in php4 a so i get to use in i create the then implement it

 receiving this warning because the iphone is dangerously low on this can generally be for one of two have a memory are allocating far too many objects and need to revisit your the first one you should run instruments and examine your memory this can really slow down your app requires additional so try testing areas of your app one at a if you have multiple views switch between them a couple of the second you will have to examine things you are doing that could result in large memory for example if writing a flickr browser you might need to cut down the number of images you have loaded at anyone or free up some unused ones when you receive this are about the only general rules i can suggest without knowing more about your no real way i know to get figures for current memory allocation from the iphone this makes it really difficult to isolate the areas of your application that are inadvertently memory	
 recent interview question i had was if i knew what boxing and unboxing explained that value types are on stack and reference types on a value is cast to a reference we call it boxing and vice he asked me to calculate i j is messed it up and said where its actually now i think understand it however when i was playing with different combinations i was surprised to see a b referencing the pointer on stack to both objects on was expecting to see as but it is it because the second boxing destroys and replaces the whole object on the if i do class public int t new t2 new is it should be and it but this is not an example of boxing unboxing at is this so how would you summarize the values ever become the same in a conversion as vs	
 recently applied for a junior programmer position and went through the initial phone which i felt pretty good my current position is at a company that uses exclusively development for i have worked with in college and some on my own after college and that is what i want to use for my career in the have the first programming book for by jesse liberty from a college i remember this book being really helpful to me in college and i want to spend another dollars on a my question is how is the first section of that 1 through and even some of the later sections of the has the language changed so much that it would be better to not read this book and use some other online i have some new books that should take care of the stuff that has changed for web but i mainly want to get refreshed on the to is a great website i just refreshed a few minutes later and had several great responses from other been doing primarily support at my current position rather than new development so not extremely familiar with all the new majority of time is spent legacy apps with this is why applying for a junior level posision and would be willing to take a slight paycut just to be able to do new development with guidance from a good lead i think that would be a lot better for my future career

 recently been reading louis book on sql server database design and found it quite picked up on alot of concepts that i previously know alot primarily i picked up on a way to set up database relationships that i tried you use a surrogate key as the tables pk auto incremented id and then set up one or more alternate keys consisting of one or more unique theese alternate kays would then be the values used for relationships the if that makes more sense for the given remodelled an old database that was suffering from some data inconsitencies due to poor design to implement to new way of a database level it works tha relationships function the way supposed to and the constraints are enforced in a reliable cannot get it to work properly in either the entity framework or in linq to sql i read that in v1 of it just flat out support this kind of relationship so i moved to linq to sql to see if things would work out they seemingly as i got all the relationships automatically mapped out when i imported the classes from my the problem is that i save data to the database because of invalidcastoperation exceptions as soon as i try to save i have a couple of this a limitation in linq to is there a way to work preferebly without for update and delete safety is something i to this way of designing hope someone can shed some light on as getting quite frustrated about i really find any good material on the subject online so hopefully someone here has an answer or can point me in the right i ended up doing was this i went back to using the entity framework in conjunction with a redesign of the database i remodeled the relationships to rely on primary keys rather than alternate in most where that was not an option i made some modifications to the ef i implemented the relationship that relied on the at which time ef to get around that i had to delete the foreign key property on the many side of the relationship at which point ef accepts the to sql and relationship

 reference counting for this kind of problem smells much nicer and architectural solution would be to use some kind of easiest way to implement this would look if gdatabasesettings nil then gdatabasesettings result the when you use always use interface do not mix both class en interface vars instead of otherwise reference counting will get in your way invalid pointer the above gdatabasesettings is also of type so it gets a proper reference and will last till your program

 remember that you are creating a model of game that does not depend on the details of any operating your game depends on state management and algorithms which depend on the the key is to write your game logic without dependencies to specific libraries which means a lot of call directly you should write an or macro that can be changed based on the use dword when you can use a class or typedef that can be tailored to different instance if you where making a football then algorithms for throwing the positions of the players could be done completely in standard without platform if your encapsulation was good you could dump the state of you game to a file and display it separately with a rendering

 second option is into a method and call it from private private final apples null apples new return public final void apple a a public final void apple a a public return the fact that people also expose the collection itself lazy initialization strategy can prevent if you want the underlaying collection to be exposed which is a very good idea you have to make it make it final as in the sample above and provide an iterator to access the elements of the not to pass the collection it think you have it	
 second option is not initialization but with types that have user defined default the second option will call the default constructor and later on call the assignment operator user defined or to assign the types cannot be default if you have an attribute without default hold references or or have constant attributes they must be initialized in the initializer can be in the initialization but not in the constructor x the equivalent for int i i int pod you can them in the initialization list but not inside the x equivalent to easier to read and subtly faster as it avoids the pod podtype some classes offer functionality through the use of constructors that will be more complex after default construct a vector of 10 default initialized equivalent for int i i whenever they are in fact initialization lists are more idiomatic in

 seems like there are actually a few different issues here that should be the fundamental problem is trying to come up with a mechanism that allows an arbitrary object to be inserted in to an existing list at some point in the middle of that describe what the imetadataprovider interface actually looks but it should have some way to uniquely identify a provider option would be to use a the benefit over using the class name is that it allows you to rename the classes as needed during without affecting custom providers as long as you keep the guid the than using a simple list you should probably derive your own providerlist exposes a way for a custom provider to itself from that these mechanisms need to be smart enough to know how to insert the new provider in to the middle of the chain but also smart enough to know how to handle multiple custom providers which have been the removal process needs to be smart as well to deal with similar concerns and also ensure that someone try to remove one of your good approach here would probably be to pass the guid of the provider you want to be inserted after as a parameter to the the method would likewise take the guid of the provider to be say i insert a new provider after then another 3rd party also installs a new provider after what should the new chain order does the second provider always insert immediately after movieproviderfromxml or does it start there and then skip past any custom providers and insert after the last custom provider installed just before the next to that question is the idea that you need to have some way to distinguish between your providers and a custom you need to make sure there is a way to handle failures in the particularly when a custom provider is inserted in the wrong do want to always maintain a base list of your default when a new provider is installed in the middle of that a new chain should be created but you want to loose the base this gives you the ability to reset the chain back to the default based on priority is problematic in that you then have to determine how to handle priority as far as a attribute would you allow both on the same probably so it might make more sense to create a providerchainattribute that has a chaininsert enum where chaininsert defines before and after as enum this allows you to force the custom provider to make a decision as to whether it installs before after the specified i would still use a guid rather than the this gives you some other ideas on how to approach this

 seems that when you use you can override the default setting which is that whitespace is so i guess what happens in this case and why you get any in the second case added so the compiler thinks that you want to specify the scope it seems a bit weird so it may be a sure brian from the team will answer this doubt soon i think the compiler treats your second example just as an easier to compile ar new rnd new can force it to treat it as you wanted if you add parentheses and write something like ar new rnd new you can use parentheses to specify scopes in any place of the for example you can a a a printfn example prints and then of this seem to be very but it is useful when using the keyword that behaves like but works for objects and ensures that the object is disposed when it leaves the scope is just like in some new file new let txt printfn is now completely forgot to mention the important bit the first way of writing the code seems more natural to me it fully uses the benefits of syntax that so i would prefer it

 seems to me like the three answers so far have completely missed the point of your or i asking why win32 delphi have something like the magical function that article talks a function given the name of a dll and the type information of an returns an object that implements that interface using the standalone functions exported from the seems to be all about calling code from a win32 not about importing functions from a requires that the dlls export a special function that the manager will call when it loads the and the function must return an instance of the so the dll must be written in delphi or the on the other works with any dll written in any you could use it on if you know why win32 delphi have such a maybe codegear see much demand for it since delphi and turbo pascal had already gone for so long without certainly possible to write a function that works like and i expect it would be any harder to write than the version must have unless libraries already provide most of the pieces and delphi just wraps them up into a function that looks like the several other overloaded versions of that delphi has had for would be a few steps to implementing that function in providing only a sketch of necessary because i have a running copy of delphi handy right ask and maybe find more need to make sure that type information for an interface at a the undecorated names of its would need to generate a function stub for each method in the interface and the stub would go something like assuming the calling convention is pop the return discard the and restore the return pop pop push jmp generated each it would fill in the actual function gotten from calling with the name of the corresponding interface the calling convention is easy to wrap like is a little is a pain in the it has all the stubs it would need to generate an that looks like it implements the given it have to be an actual at compile know the layout of the interface going to be asked to so having a class accomplish final step is to provide implementations of the and would be is where call when the reference count reached do much at except claim that it supports and the interface given to used to come with a sample program that demonstrated implementing an interface without any classes at it was all done with records and function pointers is all an interface ultimately after delphi also came with the corresponding code to do it with in part to show how much easier delphi can make i find the name of the demo program but sure still around

 segfault is not an intended action of your c program that would tell you that an index is out of it is an unintended consequence of undefined c and if you declare an array are only allowed to access elements with indexes from up to anything outside of that range causes undefined if the index was near the most probably you read your own if the index was largely out of most probably your program will be killed by the operating but you anything can does c allow the basic gist of c and is to not provide features if they cost c and has been used for ages for highly performance critical c has been used as a implementation language for kernels and programs where access out of array bounds can be useful to get fast access to objects that lie adjacent in having the compiler forbid this would be for it warn about you can put warning levels high and hope for the this is called of if some compiler uses open behavior undefined to do something it has a good quality of implementation in that gcc in function array subscript is above array it instead would format your hard disk upon seeing the array accessed out of bounds which would be legal for it the quality of implementation would be rather i enjoyed to read about that stuff in the c

 similar concept as jstestdriver further except that the server is built with javascript instead of and the api follows js best practices to a much higher browser javascript testing it does browser testing with browser automation qunit style static html page testing in headless browsers and take a look at testing you get the same test case assertion this is also great for hybrid browser and write your test case with and run it both in and in a real getting so compatible with tests from browser or headless with phantomjs on multiple clients at nodejs need to run on development computer need for tests from command line be integrated in tests xunit or bdd multiple javascript test tests instead of commenting them built tests on requests to it to wrap other built own traditional teamcity and more built the html that is used to run the and emacs in so can be plugin for group results by like testswarm it does however print out the browser name and version in the test history of previous test results like testswarm fully work on windows of nov testswarm is also a continuous integration while you need a separate ci server for it does however output xunit xml so it should be easy to integrate with or other ci very similar concept as jstestdriver further like the server is built with javascript getting so compatible with tests from browser or headless with on multiple clients at to and automatically shutdown to run on development computer or tests from command line be integrated in tests xunit or bdd multiple javascript test tests on requests to it to wrap other qunit own for by netbeans not supports nodejs plugin for eclipse history of previous test results resig has created a tool for distributed javascript mainly for open source javascript but testswarm is open so you can set up a server yourself for corporate although this might require that you to do some integration server for all major on multiple clients at need to run on development computer need for run tests on all clients when you commit something whenever you modify the script to run the history of test results pr multiple javascript test test results for os and browser to test in a multitude of not break your build through notice the test fail before is a project from sauce labs and the internet explorer it is essentially a hosted forked version of addition to all the advantages to browserswarm already has all the browsers connected to the swarm and ready to test your therefore not requiring you to add clients yourself or maintaining installations of time is also saved from the hassle of setting up and configuring people at google have also started on a distributed javascript it is similar to that it has a and clients but it also has support for running tests from command line and plugins for eclipse and all major on multiple clients at need to run on development computer need for tests from command line be integrated in multiple javascript test show results for os or browser only browser it does however print out the version in the test history of previous test low project of how jstestdriver works at plugin intro now has their own javascript test run built with it should be able to run your existing as they and works in multiple since it runs from the i guess mostly similar to from august 25th you have experience with this please contribute with more info is a that might interest developers familiar with ruby or ruby on the syntax is based on used for testing in rails is a development framework for testing your javascript it does not depend on any other javascript it does not require a you have experience with this please contribute with more info focuses on testing javascript in the while providing as much convenience to the developer as blurb from the is a javascript unit test used by the jquery ui and jquery mobile projects and is capable of testing any generic javascript shares some history with testswarm was originally developed by john resig as part of in 2008 it got its own name and api allowing others to use it for their unit testing as at the time it still dependended on a rewrite in 2009 fixed now qunit runs completelty assertion methods follow the commonjs unit testing which was to some degree influenced by great tool is by christian the author of javascript best described by test stubs and for no with any unit testing javascript

 simple way is that the player can update your via and that javascript function can be called every seconds by the flash function a video with id sets a cookie with a value of the var cookiedata videoid time the flash actionscript can invoke the javascript frequently to get a fairly accurate update of where the player was the last time the cookie was each time it overwrites the cookie with updated flash video player variables for video id and current player 5 will invoke a js function on the host page named pass in the provided you revisit the the first thing the server does is check to see if you have a cookie called of and if the value of that cookie is the position set last time you were viewing stated in the this is a very simple way to accomplish what i find the best way to learn is to go with a simple implementation and then add complexity once the simpler case is hulu likely makes periodic updates behind the scenes using if you watch the net traffic while watching a video using something like see occasional calls to

 so having a similarly hard time reading the entirety of that but see if i can piece it together from what i did figure start gitk simplifies things by condensing a string of commits into an containing a series of commits that each only have one parent and one aside from anything doing this should cut down pretty dramatically on the number of nodes you have to consider for your which will help out any algorithm you as a related commits will end up grouped does introduce some complexity in terms of finding an arc when you read a new there are a few new commit has a single or no it extends a most of the just extend the most recent there are a few interesting may cause an existing arc to be if its parent already has a child its parent turns out to be a branch which i gather you know ahead of could be a that connects two arcs may already know that this commit has multiple new commit has multiple parents merge may want to include the or commits in or it may make more sense to keep them either it be too difficult to build up this set of arcs you have these still left with trying to linearize in your the first algorithm described on the aforementioned sounds as you have a known set of branch points to use as your initial set commits should be first of you only have to care when you connect two either through a new merge a branch or combining two arcs into any given arc can easily maintain its current row number range fine with putting an arc on sequential so traversing up the tree checking that all new ancestors show up later should be pretty know enough to say much about drawing the graph but i imagine it be too different from what you do i hope that it was interesting to think at

 so it turns out that the default implementation of the function works differently depending on whether the referenced script file is on the same domain or external references such cause jquery to create an external script which can be debugged with no if you reference a local script file such as any of the jquery will download the script content asynchronously and then add it as inline script latter approach does work with any debugger that i tested ie8 workaround is to override the function so that it always creates an external reference rather than inline here is the script to do i have tested this in and ie replace the normal jquery getscript function with one that debugging and which references the script files as external rather than var head var script handle script var done attach handlers for all if done if handle memory leak in we handle everything using the script element return	
 so many before writing a php script to do some image the script has earned womm on my but when i move it to my host an images above a certain filesize cannot be moved all operations to the to be certain not some latent the relevant just to be switch case my mystical powers of been able to determine that is not in the script halts completely when it gets to some is correlated to images under 1mb appear to be fine but images around 3mb no clue what the precise cutoff is not due to server returns in on 3mb significantly longer on images no processing of large the function call with to suppress errors has no this matches well with the fact that the script is not throwing an simply silently terminating upon this function i had to there may be some gd parameter that i know about have access that limits input file sizes on servers the config variable guess is due to the fact that it barfs and appear to do any actual loading of or computations on the thanks for the calls to indicate that php is updating the and variables this necessarily mean that these resources are being simply that they appear to be functioning as following some references from the i tried optimizing the jpeg in quality from 3mb to with no so not an image filesize i then tried reducing the number of pixels of the original 3888x2592 and the first successful size is 1400x2592 and 1402x both result in and errors indicating which make much sense unless the entire image being by reducing further to i can instantiate the 400x300 thumbnail image that actually looking at the call using to take care of that task fails silently in the same manner as to why this a little 1400 2592 gives nothing particularly but i have to imagine this is a limit on the number of pixels gd php will is silently terminating

 solution by while noble and well has a few so i thought provide my own problems with the tilde in expand to your homedirectory inside and neither when read by the statement or quoted in the which means get such file or off and such for basic operations is especially when using a crappy shell to avoid the weight of also noticed a few quoting for instance around a parameter expansion in his the solution cannot cope with filenames that contain no solution in can cope with them which is why i almost always prefer far more bulletproof harder to exploit when used using for your hashbang means you must avoid at all you can use all the you even on ubunutu or whatnot when honest and put at the a solution more probably and more echo exit the quotes around in the check will also fail if is so two checks in avoided regular expressions for a if you must use in you should be putting the regular expression in a in any globs like mine are always preferable and supported in far more bash	
 solution far right that the executionmode is what you want to use when wanting something to come out in the start or end mode of the which is part of what you then you say you want that script tag put out in the start mode of only the first tag used on the where you would use suggestion of the request unlike the default the request scope is shared among all custom tags on a given you proposed using the caller and that could unless the caller was another custom in which case the caller scope would only be the local scope in the custom the request scope has been around since about cf is your best that your proposed solution was in the custom in the start programatically check if you have already created a tracking variable in the request scope when you put the script tag out the first if put out the script tag and create the tracking than changing your code from using caller to also suggest want to put the cfset inside the no need to execute it again for when the if test

 speaking with databases you rarely delete you can mark it as deleted but generally speaking you keep it in your database at least for a are many reasons for some of them are you may have requirements ot keep data for a given some of them are sometimes its just a you may need to restore the the user may request their account is reopened or it may have been locked due to spamming but that was because the account had been compromised and has now been data may be deleted or archived but this may take months or even i just give relevant data a status column 1 0 and then just change the status rather than delete it of the integrity is another issue let me give you an you have two want to delete a particular what do you do about messages sent and those messages will appear in someone inbox or sent items so you delete do you set the relevant field in message to that make a lot of sense either because that message did come from go even if they active better off just marking that user as deleted and keeping them it makes this and similar situations much easier to deal also mention forum threads and so you delete those either there are other reasons to do so such as spam or because content that is related to other content forum messages that have been replied only data you can safely and reasonably delete is child this is really the difference between aggregation and the user and message relationship above is an example of composition is house and you delete a house and all the rooms go rooms cannot exist without a this is composition in entity relationship a find more instances of aggregation than composition my so the question what do you do with that really hard to erase all traces of someone without deleting things you just mark them as locked or inactive and deal with it that

 standard approach in the webapp world is to split the key and put it in different you might split the key and put part of it in the filesystem of the part of it in the jndi configuration and part of it in the getting any single piece particularly hard if examining backup media or sql but getting all of the pieces will require a lot more can split a key by it with random numbers of the same a cryptographically strong random number you can repeat this process several times if you want to split the key into multiple at the end of the process you three partial keys such that p1 p2 p3 you might need to some of the partial keys so they can be stored in a jndi are more sophisticated ways to split a an algorithm where you require all of the pieces to recreate the but beyond what you need you can require the user to actively enter the there are pbe algorithms that convert a password to a good symmetric you want to find one that requires an external file as again a case the tape backups or the password itself you need you could also use this to split the password into two pieces with jndi you can use a plaintext passphrase in jndi and an initialization file somewhere in the whatever you do be sure you can your application fairly one approach is to use the password obtained above to decrypt another file that contains the actual encryption this makes it easy to change the password if you think been compromised without requiring a massive reencryption of all of the data just reencrypt your actual

 the content again after you load the simplest way tends to just add a null string to the	
 the content of not define float int you have to fool around with casts and just inside your	
 the content of tables is an problematic since there is no simple and solution to achieve best and most secure way to do it requires you would achieve even horizontal scrolling easily included for with this technique i you can transform that to your problem i made 3 placed the middle table that holds the data inside a div set the div style to gave the header and footer table and the div each a width of surrounded everything by another div to control the overall table made very sure that the quantity of columns match in all three and that all three have the same styles regarding margins and the interesting below the last element of that table write a javascript block include it from a write a function that successively looks at each column a for starting with the first at every iteration of that check the td cell with of the first two tables in the current check which with is the bigger one and assign that to the smaller td you may want to apply that value to the footer call that you may want to do that in an interval or when special events such as new data in the cells using ajax for if you do scroll your columns sizes are but you will have to synchronize the scrolling position of your header and footer table with the content alternatively you just let the overall div scroll the whole thing but not that would be the job of the div that contains the data technique worked very well in all major browsers in an very coplex gantt diagram you can think of that concept easily in a 90 degrees rotated so that you fix the first and last header column when here is another example from my code base that might help you to get the contentdiv var var code does the it makes that an table with 3 columns always looks like the first and last column have the same and the center column has a width of 120 that does not apply directly to your special but it might give you a starting point in dynamic table manipulation through

 the data in the text file looks like this separated by x2 x3 can read the strings into a cell array using like now stores the strings in a cell to make a variable out of one of these strings and assign it a i would use 1 will create a variable in the base workspace and assign it the value 1 the first argument can be either or to create a variable in either the matlab base workspace or the workspace of the caller you would repeat this for each string name in giving it whatever value you is an alternate answer to the one i gave you the above answer addresses the specific problem you raised in your answer gives you a whole other option to potentially avoid doing things the way you were describing them in your and it will hopefully make things easier for i understand your you basically have 256 and you want to randomly pick 30 of each of these matrices sounds like it is stored in its own variable to i would suggest storing all 256 matrices in just one variable as either a initialize all matrices as 0 2 this enters a value for the first a cell initializes an empty array of 2 enters a value for the first would have to initialize all the values then if you want to randomly pick 30 you can next randomize the order of either the third dimension of the array or the order of the cell array by using the default order of the randomly order the numbers 1 to for a for a cell just use the first 30 entries in for your calculations of the individual variables like you were puts the first matrix from the array in puts the first matrix from the cell array in can keep repeating the use of randperm to keep generating new randomized arrays of if you have to keep track of which original matrices you are you have to add this line after you randomize the entries of will tell you the original position a matrix was for if the first array entry in is then the matrix in the first position of was originally the 40th matrix you entered when you initialized this

 the general the most efficient implementation for any algorithm is the one which has the least amount of this is for many code less time to write lines of code means less bugs bugs per kloc is pretty constant for a given which are easier to find they hide well in a few lines of your algorithm fit for the easier to replace when 10 lines instead of compact implementation usually leads to clean interface which makes the code which the library clean the effect this can also lead to a more complex library implementation if that makes the client code more efficient you concentrate the effort in a single place to make everything else more also depends a lot on the access do you always walk the whole is it do you prefer to process rows or the extreme case with a billion rows and columns with only 10 cells a can be more efficient than any array for other it can be more efficient to mix the approaches depending on the problem a of arrays of when cells in a gigantic empty your problems asks to locate a and then process those it might be more efficient to use a 2d so the first access returns an array which you can then process without bothering about

 the most part openmp and opencl are independent from each they are both ways of giving the developer access to parallelism on their is designed to work well with multiple where work that is approximately equal can be automatically farmed out between is a somewhat different in that it is really shines when working with special it will allow you to offload some of the number crunching to the gpu or some other like in the it was also built with the idea that it could be used to harness other main as are now common in i would consider this feature to be and if this is all you intend to use opencl i would not recommend using guess it would be somewhat though definitely not impossible to get openmp and opencl to work together in the same first thing to think about is what work giving to this would definately be a case where you would only want opencl to run on the on the other since openmp is alreay using it cause application errors to run opencl and openmp on the same main but it will cause scheduling where both the openmp and opencl run slower because they spend a good chunk of their time switching back and fourth between each this would also happen if you run any other process on the same core at the same other big thing to think about is how going to schedule tasks that do run on the its true that you can feed a lot of work into one of the modern but there are lots of things to think about with the pipeline and memory what you want to happen is to have 8 different openmp threads each trying to send their own work to the at the same i would recommend having only one thread that manages all the interactions with the so it can make sure to feed it work in an efficient sure there are programs that have multiple types of tasks happening at the same where one type of task could always be farmed out to the and another kind of task could be handled by the main this would be a fine example of a time to mix openmp and

 the thing it is about or or at some place in your writing a method to do say a public it should not assume much or anything about the caller it should merely do the job it is supposed to regardless of who is calling it and what context the caller is for some it cannot complete its then it needs to tell the caller i do and exceptions are an excellent mechanism to let it tell the caller that the only but the best mechanism ever seen for most when you throw the you have no idea whether it will be caught or not because exposing a public method and you have no idea who might choose to call it and catching of the exception is the job of the for say writing a library with public methods that might throw say using that library from a windows forms the windows forms app might catch exceptions and show a message box to the you might use the same library from a windows the service would be more likely to catch the log return an error to the original but keep running so it can process further the exception is like a contractual agreement between the caller and the the provider either do the job or tell you why i what you do from there is your own and the caller if you do the just tell me and decide what to do in that

 the top of my it seems like this is very dependent underlying hw a and only as far as i the stack is allocated way at the top of the linear address considering you have all sorts of runtime libraries your actual data most likely running at the top of that either if you exceed the area allocated by run into other and if you exceed your stack also run into the bottom line is that i think you have to worry about wraparound from 0xffffffffffffffff to but you still have to ensure you go over the bounds of either your automatic or manually allocated	
 the top of the exception hierarchy is it is a checked exception compiler forces you to catch it or declare that you throw throwable there is also a checked and an unchecked exception compiler warn you about exception there is also an unchecked way that the designers of java intended exceptions to be used things that can go low level things that can go wrong and a program cannot recover programmer errors going past the end of an or calling a method on idea behind not having to catch unchecked exceptions is that they indicate failures or that either you cannot handle or should not exist in a properly debugged program everyone agrees with the intent of the designers of java on this and chose to use runtimeexception to mean things other than programmer

 the varied responses will tell the line between interpreted and compiled is no longer as clear as it was when such terms were in also something of a mistake to consider as being either interpreted or as different of languages may do different these days you can find both and when looking at an things still there are layers of here are a few of the gradations between interpreted and pretty much what it says on the read a line of source and immediately do what it this actually done by many production languages pretty much just things like shell a trivial optimisation on the rather than interpret each line from first tokenised rather than seeing a string like 52 translated into a stream of tokens to avoid repeatedly performing that state of many versions of basic worked this this is the approach taken by languages like java and see the code is transformed into instructions for a these instructions are then this is also the approach taken by python at least the most common the and implementations also take this but compile to the bytecode for the java and virtual machines in time as but rather than interpreting the the code that would be performed is compiled from the bytecode at the point of and then in some this can actually outperform native as it is free to perform runtime analysis on the and can use specific features of the current processor static compilation may need to compile for a lowest common denominator later versions of and use this performs this for the code is compiled to the machine code of the target you may think now completely eliminated but even here there are some machine code instructions are not actually directly implemented in but are in fact implemented via even machine code is sometimes

 there are a ton of resources out best advice to start is to find a pattern that you feel comfortable with and stick to it for the there is nothing worse then changing your mind the way that i have found and like to use is the repository or provider the repository pattern just makes sure you have standard access to like your store catalog or cms you create an interface that in my case expose sets of iqueryable the object or the data model are just standard classes with now extra fluff poco old clr interface icmsrepository void just implement the interface for your different like a linq to sql making sure to return the poco objects as the nice thing about this is that you can then make extension methods off of the iqueryable to get what you need static int return from c in qry select you to chain repository and filter to delay sql new sec nice thing about using the interface approach is the ability to test and mock it up or dependency inject your preferred storage at run method i have used and is used in the framework a lot is the provider this is similar except instead of an interface you create a singleton abstract your implementations on top of the abstract class will then define the storage access means flat the base abstract class will be also be resonsible for creating singleton based on take a look at this for on the provider you can look at similar

 these questions are more about seeing the interviewer wrestle with the and the error boundary cases and the choice of suitable environment for the more than they are about the actual function here is written around the closed 4 cycle if the function f is only permitted to land only on signed 32bit then the various solutions above will all work except for three of the input range numbers as others have pointed minint will never satisfy the functional so raise an exception if that is an i am permitting my python function to operate on and return tuples the task spec admits it only specifies that two applications of the function should return an object equal to the original object if it is an would be asking for more detail about the allows my orbits to be nice and and to cover all of the input integers i originally envisaged the cycle to visit half integer but i want to get tangled up with rounding hence the tuple which is a way of sneaking complex rotations in as without using the complex arithmetic that no state needs to be preserved between but the caller does need to allow the return value to be either a tuple or an if return a if 0 raise valueerror make sure the tuple is well else return elif int if x this value satisfy the functional relation signed 2s complement 32 bit raise else send this integer to a tuple else not an int or a raise applying f to 37 twice gives and vice x x x x x f twice to zero gives x x we handle the one case for which the problem has no solution x x recent call file line in x file line in raise you think the function breaks the complex rule by mimicking the 90 degree rotations of multiplying by we can change that by distorting the here the tuples represent half not complex if you trace the orbits on a number you will get nonintersecting loops that satisfy the given functional n 2 if n is and not y is 2 and x is not more than implement this f2 by modifying and there are other have the intermediate landing points be rational numbers other than half a fraction module that might prove need a sign exercise has really nailed for me the delights of a dynamically typed i see a solution like this in

 thing i quite is how you plan to prune your you have 2m rows per but you specified how much data you plan to at some point you will want to expire data by age all this want to do it by dropping not by executing a delete which locks up every single partition for an incredibly long time it has to do a full table scan to find the rows to then leaves your table no smaller as the partitions are full of by hash of might seem sensible for but partitioning by time could ease contention when you come to prune old and will definitely be a good has a feature called which you will almost definitely need to use all the time in order to achieve concurrency and this mandates a meaning that you can only do deletes by dropping dropping partitions is also good because you can get the disc space said all of 80g that big and i might have been tempted to store it all in a single and use innodb to enable concurrent and if you did use you could have a primary key of which means it would cluster rows with the same probably want a secondary index on to enable efficient test this with your production data sizes and let us know what you

 thing that comes to one could track execution time of the queries and if it passes some threshold which is considered normal it gets logged along with some profiling information is discarded might also be feasible to profile individual parts of the query data acquisition from logic and so then again compare the times against some pitfall is that some are bound to be processed significantly longer then others because of the difference in the amount of they one would have to keep a whole lot of averages for different parts of the site different types of queries in order to get rid of constant flow of normal queries that execute longer by is a very simple approach sure there are better ways to do

 think a flash cookie would probably stay around the longest for the simple reason that most people clear them too they show up in the usual browser dialogs and cleared by the usual to tie a user to an ip address is useless and downright insecure if trying to keep people logged ip addresses change often and you rely on it for anything guess the best thing to do is use both a normal browser cookie a flash that way you catch all the users those who block flash by just in	
 think a good idea to ask how much longer the expect to be using the if the lifespan is limited three years or then it may not make sense to put much effort into if the lifespan is expected to be then the payback for refactoring becomes that much more might also want to try creating a business case for the investment in show specific examples of the kinds of improvements that you would want to make an honest assessment of the and expected try to find a specific refactoring that you could implement independently of the and lobby for approval to make that change as a test run of the refactoring when you talk about you may be expected to provide specific not enough to say will be much easier to fix you should be prepared to say something like see a minimum improvement in turnaround time for bug or will experience fewer you should also be prepared to negotiate with management customers so that you all agree that you have measurements that are meaningful to and to provide measurements from before and after the	
 think a good idea to create a tparam with a variant variable a tobject something work but it seems very messy to pascal is not a dyanmically typed language and i try and treat it as i would suggest another function to handle so as well as having avalue avalue handle your data or create a record that defines your data for example instead of having tparam of variant and object have something so maybe you have so much different data that the route is the best but it seems like a bit of a maintenance headache when your other code gets passed an array of variant how do you know which variant is which and how to use each of them in your stored

 think any company that tries new technology for the sake of as its bleeding edge and is to have a formal play with new technology to try it out is just unless in the business of providing technology consulting to other everyone else technology is there to help the business get things not to help developers line their with cool sounding company working at the moment is quite large and has a cto that chooses but have to if you can pick a probably using too big to beat everyone down with the corporate but they if the technology will work in the project and bring it in on then it gets	
 think at the first you should bind the constructed object from the second as first parameter of the method should be the address of the constructed try to compile the one other possible issue is that the second bind functor might return the constructed object by and the first bind requires a pointer to object this so you still need a pointer as first bound parameter for

 think conditionals make your code a bit cluttered and difficult to in my opinion you could encapsulate the status within the event the status as classes to your var var var var text handler could be substituted by a tiny performance var	
 think could be of great help for you just need to add a conditional compilation line in the debug build to allow execution of this line and the debugger will the other way is attaching the debugger to the process and set a breakpoint in the	
 think deriving your class from your class demonstrates confusion of is your data editing object a special type of database or maybe it would make more sense to say the data editing object needs to use a database is the difference between is a and has it seems to be falling out of fashion you can use a singleton factory call to get the database then any function which needs it can simply call if you make the handler the first time it has to do any then nothing needs to even worry about initializing do check if the instance variable containing the handle is a resource handle if call the remember to decide what to do if the connection then you just need a way for the handler to find i would have the factory call do not the variant way of doing that is for the constructor to get the current database handler and put a reference to it in an instance this can be done several requiring it in the constructor might or you can fall back on the singleton factory call this technique gives the object constructor a chance to deny instantiation if the database handler initialize factory call can check

 think have to split manually unless you are interested in doing it a that does though it mention the max size of handled xml when doing it the first problem that arises is how to open the file would recommend a very simple text editor something like when handling such large it is always useful to turn off all forms of syntax highlighting options worth never tried it with anything this but if anything like other jgsoft it should work like a remember to turn off syntax used this with files of 1gb in works as if it were nothing at

 think i read the question a little so hopefully this response too off can get a good overview of how much memory your application is consuming by using windows task or even sysinternals this is a quick way to review your processes at their peaks to see how they are of the an x86 process will only be able to address 2gb of this means any single process on your machine can only consume up to in your likely to be able to consume only before getting out of memory much ram your copy of windows can actually address will depend on the windows version and cpu your example of 4gb the os is going to give your applications up to 2gb of ram to play in all processes and it will reserve 2gb for on the operating system your you can tweak using the switch in the will adjust that ratio to 3gb for applications and 1gb for the this has some impact to the so review that impact first and see if you can live with tradeoff a single application to be able to address greater than your going to need to set a particular bit in the pe image this has good info on this subject game changes under x64 good reference limits for windows address	
 think if your debug code is clean and has language in any logging okay to leave it if the debug code is sloppy or has debug messages like you should take it your debug statements reflect the fact that there are issues that you figure it might be best to take them if trying to your software to you can fix them	
 think in that i would make a process to manage the database editor that want to make some modifications to the database makes a call to this be it through ipc or or whatever process can then notify the player of a change in the the when he wants to retrieve some data should make a request of the data it wants to the process managing the the db process tells it what it when it notifies of a so no request from the player this will have the advantage of having only one process accessing the sqlite so no locking or concurrency issues on the

 think it depends on 2 of the it a 1 week it a 1 year somewhere in of the changes being introduced in the they architectural in potentially affecting a lot of the original are you simply adding a new a combination of the above 2 it simply make sense to spend 1 month designing a feature which will take 2 days to implement and is of little risk to the picturing a matrix here of time was some interesting advice in code complete which i am currently in the process of i remember the exact so i am paraphrasing but it said something along the lines 2 biggest mistakes you can make in a design attemping to design everything will designing nothing before the happy medium between these 2 is the key to successful design and

 think it really depends on the definition of or the purpose of consider jobs settle for you being good in the core expect you to be proficient with specific apis swing for or even apis all the apache you necessarily have to know every corner and industrial research may require you to really know the language inside and for if you write a static analysis tool or a compiler best to know of the education and in often important to know all the weird corners and their this is typical with in because you can count on students making these mistakes in because that is where some of the weirder bugs lie race conditions in static for how features are i think you can be a great programmer without knowing how certain things are implemented details of the vtbl in but important to know how other things are implemented garbage memory some to write really good and efficient

 think it would be best to separate pages into gwt if you will use to check if specific slot or other exists your module will hold all of your so client will load whole only accessing one page which well be unnecessary can place common code in some module which all of your pages modules will inherit is better for you to have sets of widgets panels in your ui main and you can place them in proper slots on structure in your app would look like question in common widgets common images images css expenses entry point reports entry point that you can use one service in all as well in common module you might have to create entry point not in some old project i had to create empty entry but remember exact reason worked for certainly would like to hear different

 think making very clear that the most frequent participants get the most input is we have one client for our latest app that is in every meeting where the others tend to be occasionally as a the features that are adjusted added to the app are more useful to the one if you can get them to understand that their feedback truly shapes the end product they are likely to want to be	
 think markusq has the but let me develop an alternative that you may find easier to use my of developing this as a series of simple transformations in an analogue of in a procedural put everything in common recall that column is seconds since the midnight 1 january we can find the number of seconds since midnight of the day of the that call by just taking s modulus the number of seconds in a 60 60 as 60 dur 1 as subtract one from because a one second call that starts at also ends on can find minutes since midnight by dividing those results by or just by s 60 view s 60 as s dur 60 as we create a table of we need 1440 of numbered from 0 to in databases that support arbitrary i an artificial range or like create table id int not null primary key idz insert into values repeat next line to double insert into select idz from to create a create view minute as select id 1 as from where id we just join to our record view from minutes a just cross record so we have one record row for each whole minute over which the call was that doing this by defining active as the call occurred during a that a two second call that starts at and ends at by this definition occurs during two different but a two second call that starts at and ends at occurs during one did that because you specified i need a way to check for a count of active calls for if you prefer to consider only calls lasting more than sixty seconds to occur in more than one need to adjust the if we want to find the number of active records for any granularity equal to or larger than minute we just group on that last to find average calls per hour we divide by 60 to turn minutes to select 60 as 60 as from group by 60 that that is the average per hour for over all if we want to limit it to a particular day or range of add a we create a version of that does a left outer we can get a report that shows the average over all hours in the create view select from minutes a left outer join on and we again do our but against the new select 60 as 60 as from group by 60 hour 0 1 2 3 can also index into this with a the join means have null values for the underlying table where no calls exist for a particular select 60 as 60 as from where 1 and 2008 group by 60 bring back no rows for hours in which no calls if we still want our view that shows all we make sure we also include those hours with no select 60 as 60 as from where 1 and or date is null group by 60 that in the last two using a sql date which the functions and can be not the date in your record brings up another both the date and time in your record table are superfluous and as each can be derived from your column leaving them in the table allows the possibility of inconsistent in which or prefer to do it like create table record id int not null primary create view as select as from the the is an enumerated type that tells the function to add is the column in	
 think nick has the right it sounds like you are performing your search and populating your listview in your onclick method for your search you need to perform your search preferably cache the data the first time and bind that to the listview for each new page that is requested using the can do this fairly easily by creating a method for the onpagepropertieschanged perform the search pull from the and bind the listview in that onpagepropertieschanged event and your data should your code might look like void eventargs void your void eventargs	
 think of any way to do this with standard could write a plugin for that manages referential integrity between the parent and child tables on different and against child query for matching row in parent fail if no match found in parent against parent query for dependent rows in child fail if any dependent rows found in child if the constraint is intended to support cascading do that instead of against parent if the primary key value is changing as part of the query for dependent rows found in child fail if any dependent rows found in child if the constraint is intended to support cascading do that instead of that have to keep information about the referential integrity constraints in your mysql proxy plugin write a custom config file for your plugin that records the you use conventional syntax to declare such constraints across mysql

 think part of includes knowing malicious but at the same you necessarily need to know all of the techniques in order to defend against them knowing about attacks the reason to try and protect your buffers from you protect them from overflowing because if they it could wreak havoc in your program regardless of whether a bug or an you write very thoroughly checked and well architected then the malicious attacks will be unable to because good architecture should automatically lock out and unauthorized that last paragraph assumes that we have a perfect job where we are given incredible amounts of time to make our code since such a job then knowing the malicious techniques is a good because it means that although your code you can create for those exploits to make sure that they do not get those make the code and they make the application knowing malicious exploits is something that is good to be aware but of them will be covered by simply making sure you adhere to best	
 think part of it is that imap is usually used in scenarios where the emails are retained on the whereas pop is used almost exclusively for situations where the email is downloaded to the local which is what most isps providing email facilities for their customers want you to do also what most of the customers probably want as although less so as they get more exposure to the internet and things like gmail and reason it is probably preferred by email providers is that it does much like an rss news the pop client will open a connection to the authenticate ask for any email and do whatever processing it and then close the clients generally keep one or more sockets open with the server the whole time they are taking up those yet another reason for isps to prefer mail supports both pop and imap i do not mean to sound like i am having a go at i think the reasons attributed to them above are very pragmatic and

 think rapid prototyping means more flexible sure it is more flexible at the but as the application it becomes harder and harder to theoretically the use of interfaces makes it easier to keep unrelated parts the end of the it all depends on the say there is a if the application is upfront design is necessary to be able to add new features in a timely if the application is then it might be better to use something more	
 think really just a matter of how well known the idioms linux for has a lot of you never int x you int compiler will make it argue with the kernel not return return occasionally this mixing of integers with booleans can come out really like meat of which use gotos liberally for error handling which is a bit one or two line things are probably a wash when it comes to readability and trivial the real meat in the maintainability and readability departments is my in larger scale to a lot of the oop stuff tends to make code easier to but harder to and harder to to a net not a big fan of i veered off

 think that makes a lot of it the policy itself that you depend rather than just the of you going to want to ask the policy questions whether or not an action is that means need an instance of the policy which means it makes sense for it to be passed into the are suitable when you want a strongly typed api where part of the api depends on another but the implementation itself care what the type is with some the collections api is probably the canonical example a care what but wants to expose a api terms of i see that fitting in with your policy

 think that the separation of view from business is a velocity feature that is not present in you can do business logic in jsp or but not recommended at but i agree in your point regarding the is compiled to so i think that velocity is not done benchmarks of because closer to of creating reusable has lots of has no components itself component of open source 3rd have seen far more projects using jsp or jsp related technologies than maybe because velocity is really low are plenty of tools for especially the eclipse jboss suite has a good jsp for velocity are mostly not functional or pretty basic get lucky if you have syntax	
 think that there 3 main reasons why arrays are passed as pointers in c instead of by the first 2 are mentioned in other no size information for arrays in general you include dynamically allocated i think a third reason is due evolution of c from earlier languages like b and where arrays were actually implemented as a pointer to the array ritchie talks about the early evolution of c from languages like bcpl and b and in particular how arrays are implemented and how they were influenced by bcpl and b arrays and how and why they are different remaining very similar in expressions because array names decay into pointers in

 think the best approach is to introduce 1 concept at a you need to explain arrays in the first you can detangle almost anything by introducing 1 concept at a would teach them in this can teach simple arrays first so they understand the ability to have multiple data slots accessible from a single variable following need an understanding of you can teach about pointers and how they starting with some simple y sure to give a special emphasis that a pointer is just like any other it stores a memory is no need to get into the stack vs heap just to iterate over arrays with the first the second you can teach more complicated to do pointer i shorthand for arrays to functions as array pointets vs pointer param arrays are continuous blocks of string sizeof works with pointers vs array types size vs buffer more complicated concepts like allocating and the levels of arrays all examples make heavy use of sizeof and printing it really helps to understand going

 think the considerations related to the decisions that where made before has changed that the schema those will just help you organize the database so you can assign permissions to all inside a schema instead of having to configure for each decisions involved on whether having the identity flow down to the sql server instead of using the trusted subsytem are pretty much specific to the particular that i like to flow identity like because usually there is still logic being enforced on the application which means the sp are probably enforcing partial because of that that approach also pushes to have more logic in the stored only administrators having access to the user groups in the consider looking at adam directory application i know if it supports integrating it with sql so i am not sure if that will work with that it is worth checking not being able to get the based on your i would assume there is a close relation between user groups and involved database you can get the the user has in active evaluate how adam fits in your and whether the considerations involved into using the current identity flow approach also forget to consider the impact in the project on changing the identity flow of the	
 think the easiest by of handling uitableview with custom cell is using interface it makes ui design work much easier than doing it by pure a great tutorial a on how to do highly i am not using any other method of uitableview coding since i followed said adding a gradient to your cell will be extremely just use interfacebuilder to add an image containing your gradient to the cell view and you are you have to worry about and performance wise get similar results since components are very well optimized to do plain task such as displaying an

 think the problem is that they estimate the number of steps so much as that often the wrong definition of is in your example of the installer going from 0 to in 10 seconds and then an hour for the seen that happen when the programmer decided to count the number of files to not the number of there were 10 9 of them were 5k each and the last was a 2gig the first 9 would copy really fast and the last would be counting files was the wrong thing to should have counted problem if you want to count bytes then you need to implement your own copy routine so you can provide status updates during the copy of the large is is really worth it to implement your own copy other problem is that an install many other is made up of stacks of routines that can be quite these routines can do a lot of but likely generic and have nothing in them that is capable of updating some progress meter at a much higher need to reimplement a number of common routines to get good progress for a robust i think that would be really the particular steps could be defined in a config but need to have progress updates from every part of the install the time to do these things would obviously vary from machine to so likely be way off of once done the install on a specific machine you could likely estimate the install on that machine next

 think the reason ff is giving you poor results is because leaving the page before the action takes time to as link mentions if you use a target on your external link it should work if you do that then you may have to wait for the log to although you may see delays in if e cancels the var thelink stores the link for url to logging navigate when the log return

 think there are better alternatives to option which allows this other developer to check in temporary or experimental code is to have using a language that supports have worked at places where every coder had their own matching their which they could use for things that only they were interested eventually when the code was ready for the checks were instance you might this code is code goes here i think there are sometimes cases when the incremental you want to make record does not function well enough to enable for in such the is alternative is to locally use a dvcs like mercurial to track your then when you get to a stable for the you push those changes out to the be careful of submitting too much at

 think there can be any specific learning c does for you is give you an a broadening of the into how computers a very abstract thing make you write better code in it just makes you more of a computer reference that wedge made to article mentioning shlemiel the painter is an interesting one but has no relevance that algorithm is not tied to c in any particular way it manifests itself in strings are immutable and completely different from model of so i quite see the suppose one concrete example is optimizing a parser or a lexer or a program that keeps writing to a string buffer all the if you use normal strings instead of a string run across a problem when you build very large a a copy of both and it change the string that was referenced by it creates a new allocating more becomes considerably and you keep adding small things to then shlemiel the painter will manifest then knowing this has nothing to do with knowing just knowing how your language implements things at the low is where having an experiece in c will help	
 think there is a real you just have to be aware that the generator is just like any other object that holds so it is the responsibility to make sure it is properly finalized to avoid with the resources held by the the only problem i see here is that generators implement the context management protocol least as of python so you cannot as instead have garbage collector does the but bad practice to rely on that for freeing

 think this depends on the application your if building a cms and the usage of the data is going be to display images within a web it might make sense to save the images to disk as opposed to being put into the although honestly i would do which could allow adding a server to a farm without having to copy files all over the use case might be a complex such as a or even a business object with lots of you could serialize both of these into a binary or text based and save them in the then you get the benefit of the think people should be using queries in the first what you do is provide two ways to get the one methods returns the summary the second would return the i imagine why you would need to return thousands of images all at

 think this is what you are looking mycondition it answered your you want to exit the method due to an error you can throw an exception like new error you want to return with a you should return like before with the value you it is the exception you need you can catch it with a try catch in the method calling your for 1 mycustomexception e put error handling int val val 1 throw new return inherits from the exception

 think this very simple method should help you understand the method will call itself until a certain condition is true and then anumber anumber 0 anumber 1 function will print out all numbers from the first number feed it till 10 wil 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 then stop because anumber is no longer larger then bassicly happens is that will write 10 and then call which will write 9 and then call until writes 1 and then calls which will write 0 butt will not call code is essiantially the same why use recursion you might if a does essentially the well you mostly use recursion when you would have to nest for loops but know how deep their for example when printing out iemts from nested nestedarray a a string nested in an a string even the last stringorarray stringorarray stringorarray stringorarray will a a string nested in an a string even the last function could take an array which could be nested into a 100 while you writing a for loop would then require you to nest it 100 would be enough for the nestedaaray we have but you would nest the for loops even more if you would nest the array another for typeod for typeod for you can see the recursive method is a lot

 think to answer this question we would need to know about the architecture of your entire program or whatever the case may answer it there are a number of strategies you can others have pointed on a modern desktop or server operating you can and not worry about the memory your program has strategy for if you are developing on an embedded operating system where might not clean everything typically what i see is when individual functions return due to an they make sure to clean up anything they themselves have you see any calls after 10 each function would in turn indicate an error when it and each function would clean up after the original function you will it might not be called would detect the clean up any memory it had and take the appropriate you just have not rocket where it gets difficult is if you have multiple threads of and shared data then you might need a garbage collector or a way to count references and free the memory when the last user of the structure is done with for if you look at the source to the bsd networking see that it uses a value in some structures that need to be kept for an extended period of time and shared among different is basically what garbage collectors as

 think what trying to accomplish is possible as a sql your desire is to return 25 no matter what the normal data groupings are whereas sql is usually picky about returning based on data you want a purely you may be able to accomplish this with a stored in mysql and it might just make more sense to run the query to return all rows and then trim it programmatically within the	
 think what you are doing is quite such little things as changes in displaying could and should be undertaken by example i have a main menu rendered by a separate there are lots of such little checks inside in order to decide what text to show and which styles to apply to list there are big decisions like thinking of what view to render based on some user action then the controller questions the business logic and decides what view to return of where to but if it is a quite stable ui element where only text and color options are slightly changed then put the necessary logic into could also pass a separate model to your ascx with several flags defining what and how should be then the actual logic to set those flags will be somewhere else on the business logic level and all your view will do is just look at those flags and render doing it	
 think what you need to come up with here is a your integer array of writing the ints directly to the i would the array by turning it into a string the string might what would be sent over the on the receiving split the string by the commas and build the array back is more is human and means people have to think about byte orders and other silly you were working in or probably encode it in like	
 think what you want to do is pass an arbitrary number of i think what you have here is a case where you have multiple types of in your passing a but you also mention sometimes pass an so it seems to me what you really want to do is declare your callback to take a and a flag to indicate what it something int switch case list case ele passing things as a the list should know the so you have to worry about passing you could define multiple types of callback and always callback the right one based on what sort of processing you need to not restrained to straight c you can use you may investigate using as it is very useful for this sort of

 think you should ask the other way when should you not use floating for most numerical floating point is the preferred data as you can forget about overflow and other kind of problems typically encountered with integer way to look at floating point data type is that the precision is independent of the that is whether the number is very small of very big an acceptable range of the number of meaningful digits is approximately the drawback is that floating point numbers have some surprising like x x can be false x is they do not follow most mathematical rules that is y depending on the values for and this can	
 think you should take an approach to capture codes when you problems with the function call of if your subsequent computation depends on what the function if you are pretty sure the call cannot result in errors you have no use for the return value even skip capturing the return is one of those areas where an engineering not some prescribed is to be relied the same thinking i believe would apply to exception	
 think you should use codecompiler for that there is no need in reflection or shelling out csc as all the required support is already provided within out the microsoft support to programmatically compile code using also take a look at the namespace at you will need to perform some googling in order to find samples that suite your code generation had been discussed a lot so you have problems finding might be also interested in automating of your source code generation so t4 is also worth looking refer to blog to find out all details towards t4

 think you want to use the indirect function to lookup the value of a rather than define a lookup range directly in the data have a look at which explains it fairly warned though that multiple cascading validations like this have particular problems of their if you make a second third then go back and edit the first there is no automatic flag to say that the selection may now be for if you have the then change the first you may now have a finding such inconsistencies can be very or requires some code to the ddoe blog shows one method to highlight such errors using conditional but this is very calculation intensive and scale aware that multiple lookups of this nature can bring a workbook to its knees if used even without using conditional in for a small project where data entry is tightly controlled this is a flexible method of cascading drop down but if you have little control over the or if the data collected will grow past a few hundreds lines then probably want to look at validating the validation using or just going the whole hog and forcing entry through a which is by far the best if the data absolutely has to stay the way it then an advanced filter which creates the named ranges used in the validation would be at this level of complexity though surely be better off just using a form for data

 thinking about this for a i came to the conclusion that probably a bad idea to do asynchronous events in windows forms windows forms events should be raised on the ui doing otherwise presents an undue burden on and possibly makes a mess with objects and asynchronous cleaner to let the clients fire off their own asynchronous processing or some other or handle the event are of for raises the event on a thread pool but the initial notification comes in on a pool it looks like the general rule raise the events on the same thread that got the initial at the rule that works best for that way no question about leaking

 this actually a strange as it might of the type of a constructor instance method field m of a type c that is not inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces is erasure of its type in the declaration corresponding to type of a static member of a raw c is the same as its type in generic declaration corresponding even though the type signature use any type parameters of the class type erasure kicks in and the signature becomes effectively map other i think you can imagine a raw type as being the same api as the generic type but with all bits removed from the not the this unchecked new map unchecked s2 because an implicit but unchecked conversion from the raw type to you can get the same effect by making an explicit conversion does nothing at execution in the last but with an unchecked x

 this is a the important thing to be aware of is that the underlying tcp protocol does not maintain any segment that when you call multiple all of the data you sent may very easily be returned by a single call at the other the data sent in one call may be returned in multiple at the other if some packets got delayed due to network this is fundamental to the design of and your application must be designed as noted by the call returns the number of bytes that were read off the anything after that point in the buffer is and the data is not socket uses udp which is entirely as opposed to like udp does not guarantee reliability u stands for so you have to handle packets this is a lot harder than

 this is but you could really do a lot to make your code more make a struct and then redefine its type to be a pointer to just asking for trouble when it comes to usually a bad idea to hide the fact that pointers are because when people see something like students return forces us to assume that returning a struct that was allocated on the which would be obviously not necessarily but a wasteful get even hairier when you add your of one as people assume that with no students is a full structure on the this will make anyone that sees do a double not obvious what while squishing assignments and comparisons into one if statement is perfectly valid c and usually not the most readable much newstudents p malloc if return people enjoy pointing out that casting the return value of malloc necessary in but it is in for your valgrind report your catstring but still pretty sketchy since hiding the memory using snprintf is a more idiomatic way to create the string you leak valgrind is it looks like just freeing the first node in your you need to traverse it and free them probably like p students next free p

 this is wide community using all kind of different it seems like appropriate place to ask you like to compile or do you prefer ask this because i tend to program things in small scripting languages with chosen modules i actually need autohotkey instead of mainstream languages with full blown ides and big libraries where every little change require to load and recompile the like the ability that the only tool i actually need to the project is any editor available on any system i happen to run the script of the interpreter which is single executable that i can either carry with me or download it instantly from internet and just save it on disk without any kind of installation also feel good to know that anybody wanting to update the project require anything else but the editor no notorious compilation dependency problems and that anybody that like the button i put can open the file and put it wherever he wants or even delete it in a matter of ask this because i noticed that there are some programmers that tend to think that anything that native executable good i even remember one post on the forum where i keep one of my open source applications another programmer said but it you prefer compiled or scripted

 this question is getting quite if this is the first time reading this i suggest you start near the bottom as the solution is there in a round about but the code is a bit reading a on i was able to change my existing class to support generic many objects are already dependent on so looking for a way of making a method generic rather than the entire tried the but it looks like this behavior want the entire class to be t foobar2 public return fb2 this supposed to not or is it a bug elsewhere that getting confused reference to put this in to some sort of perspective as to what i want to how do it in class public t where t return class foobar2 foobar1 fb1 new fb2 there any way i can do something similar to that in corrected some minor syntax details meant to make foo and return not still getting compiler when i remove the template behavior the error goes the answer so far say what doing is but if it is then why am i getting the error thanks for your the actual source code what i think is anwyay let me know if you think skipped an important imagematrix public various functions t imagefilter public various functions create a new instance of imagematrix and return filter2 the actual compiler undefined reference to the everything but the implementation line is located in a so being called from a separate does this its all in the same all blocks are different files i comment out the implementation line filter2 it builds so it seems to be this line thats causing 5 having could this be a problem with the scratch grasped the concept of templates the template definition must be in the header along with the declaration so now that moved the declaration in to everything had to use to get it is this if way off please correct this is in the header this looks really really imagematrix image imagematrix return to update when i use imagematrix image imagematrix return i get this error in member function t instantiated from conversion from to type error if i use all of that smelly code in update imagematrix public t imagematrix return i get the same error as in update support individual generic methods rather than generic

 throw any exception that is automatically thrown by the clr due to user for instance reason being is to do so creates confusion for people calling your users should be able to distinguish between actively thrown exceptions by an api and exceptions that are not actively thrown by reason is that at actively thrown exception generally represents a known state in an if i call an api and it throwns an i have a reasonable expectation that the given object is in a good it recognized a potentially bad situation and actively accounted for on the other hand if it throwns a that is an indication that the api encountered an unknown error and is now in an unreliable lesser reason is that these exceptions behave differently when thrown by user code as opposed to the for instance possible to catch a stackoverflowexception if thrown by user but not if thrown by the responding to also should not throw applicationexception or systemexception these exceptions types are too general to provide meaningful information to the code which calls your true you can put a very descriptive message into the message but not straight forward or maintainable to catch an exception based on a much better to catch it based on the rule on this

 to answer my own but i think i have assembled from a variety of including some of the answers a concise answer to my question addressing the differences in object lifecycles when transitioning to a gc gc object happens in the constructor which is called when the first reference is added to happens in destructor which is called when last variable referencing object goes out of scope or is explicitly set to object happens in the constructor which is called when the first reference is added to happens in the dispose which must be explicitly called by the client or implicitly called at the end of a using this is specifcially to free up resources that must be released immediately and not wait on the happens in finalize method which is called on the which can be if the finalize method is it is called unless the has been called previously on the object from within the dispose to flag it as already cleaned i get this feel free to edit if i missed something	
 to answer the first question i agree with not a big fan of this optimistic especially if you have timestamp columns or any fields which are not guaranteed to be the same after an update address the second question i know of any way to override default approach we ended up writing a tool which sets updatecheck never for appropriate using a batch file to call sqlmetal and afterwards running the while i think of it it was also a treat to find that sqlmetal also models relationships to set a foreign key to null instead of on join tables in we had to use the same tool to set these appropriately	
 to anticipate what the resulting value is going to be is harder than you remember the user might be pressing or the cursor might not be at the end of the or the user might have part of the value to be replaced on next and so also possible to manipulate the text field through mouse operations you get any say traditional approach is to put your validation on the event instead of then you get the value of the you get the chance to deny the but you can reset the field to the value either way best not to try to constrain input too because this can make it terribly difficult to for is an invalid number you might want to but if you it would become very difficult to type better to allow any but signal when the current input is out of by some mechanism turning the text red is

 to read the lisp are vectors of this means that most of those functions are look at clhs gives this item sequence test start end count are sequences of so a call to remove would is a is no a string is item to remove from a string has to be a nothing because the test is by default eql and eql compares the character in the string with your item also key is by default identity and does not change the if your argument is a then you have to do looks at each character of the sequence and makes it into a the string then will be compared with your item using the function this works the cost is that it needs to generate a string from each character of each string is a new way to do it a retrieves the first character of in every test and compares it with the character from the string again the cost is that it needs to get the character five times this the best way to write it if your original object comes as a we get the character from the string once and then remove compares this character with the default eql test with each character in the string it returns a new string of those characters that are not eql to do you expect to in common lisp this is the symbol does not work since a string is not an element of a characters are elements of remember also that strings with one item like are still strings and not a thus and are of different the first is a string and the second is a extracts a sequence from a that means it also extracts a string from another 1 where 1 is the start and 5 is the end appends this means that it also appends returns a new string with the strings and remove parts of a string see also the functions and as in one other answer to remove substrings from a string you need to write some code to extract some strings and then concatenate searches for strings in	
 to recap your you want to as much as trouble with the ie6 gc that bug has two collection occurs once every so many the more allocations you the oftener gc will more objects got the the more time each garbage collection run takes crawl through the entire list of objects to see which are marked as solution to cause 1 seems to keep the number of allocations assign new objects and strings as little as solution to cause 2 seems to keep the number of objects delete your strings and objects as soon as you need them and create them afresh when a certain these solutions are to keep the number of objects in memory low will entail more allocations and constantly reusing the same objects could mean keeping more objects in memory than strictly for your whether reset an object by creating a new or by deleting all its that will depend on what you want to do with it probably want to assign new properties to you do so then i suggest assigning the new properties and skip deleting or clearing sure that properties are either overwritten or the object be used but will be repopulated at some later then i suggest deleting it or assigning it and create a new one later no easy to use way to clear a jscript object for reuse as if it were a new object without creating a new which means the short answer to your question is like jthompson

 trying to export classes from a dll that contain objects such as and the whole class is declared as dll export class problem is that for members of the complex types i get this class needs to have to be used by clients of class able to remove some of the warnings by putting the following forward class declaration before them even though not changing the type of the member variables class class like the forward declaration the for when the member is compiled but is it does it realy change anything when the client compiles this header and uses the std container on his will it make all future uses of such a container possibly not and does it really solve the problem that the warning tries to warn this warning anything i should be worried about or would it be best to disable it in the scope of these the clients and the dll will always be built using the same set of libraries and compilers and those are header only using visual studio 2003 with the standard std update like to target you more though as i see the answers are general and here talking about std containers and types as maybe the question really we disable the warning for standard containers and types available to both the client and the dll through the same library headers and treat them just as treat an int or any other does seem to work correctly on my if so would should be the conditions under which we can do should maybe using such containers be prohibited or at least ultra care taken to make sure no assignment copy constructors etc will get inlined into the dll general like to know if you feel designing a dll interface having such objects for example using them to return stuff to the client as return value is a good idea or not and why like to have a interface to this maybe the best solution is what neil butterworth suggested creating a static classes containing objects from a

 trying to track down possible causes of my app not being able to connect to a db have a windows service that connects to the database when it the service runs on machines with a reliable wired network installed with startup automatic so normally it starts when windows and in almost all cases this works with one set of xp machines i have control the database connection fails when the service starts up with windows the standard exception is error has occurred while a connection to the connecting to sql server failure may be caused by the fact under the default settings sql does not allow remote sql network 26 error these machines if a user is logged in and starts the service manually it connects to the database which is pretty so i guess the problem at windows startup is service starts before the network is service starts before the machine can connect to dns to resolve the server name how db server names are is a on the machine that initially prevents outgoing problem occur when a user manually starts the so something must have happened to resolve the i guess this is either a process that runs at startup but finished when my service or the fact that a user has logged in possibly something in their logon have direct access to the so need to come up with a good idea of what the problem could be and a way to identify if i repeatedly deploy diagnostic programs so need to be thorough the first first question does anyone know of desktop network policies or software that could cause this second what can i do to diagnose exactly what is thinking of creating a new diagnostic service which will also be installed to start automatically and will perform various actions to see what is going and log this see if there is a network the database server by ip address see if it can find the the database server by the hklm registry key that contains the server name case the hklm registry is later sql connection to the database find out when this starts these steps every few have this service restart the then after a period have a user log the diagnostics should show some useful but anyone have a better idea or additional have also tried changing the service to run as a user account with suitable but that resolve the note that the local system account does have sufficient priveleges to connect to the db since the service works fine when manually so not the same as troublesome machines are running win gives a good discussion of error code connection work when service starts at boot but works when manually

 types can be set to null since reference type variables is just a pointer to the actual indicating the lack of an instance is easy since you can set the variable to null value types this is a bit harder since a value type variable always contains a the use of or was somewhat valid in the back then there was no easy way of expressing the lack of a value in value with nullable types you can d thus you can also have value type variables containing is a different story since it is directly tied to expressing the value in this was introduced before nullable types which imo supersedes

 users now want to put strings the value field as well from a list and wondering what the best way of that would sounds like the users want to add new if that is the case why not just add them to your existing testcode table and keep your existing it be bad practice to the field over to a string and store both strings and integers the same there are issues related to this one but sure if any are a really big not a big often po numbers or invoice numbers have numbers or a combination of letters and you are right however about the performance of the database on a number field as opposed to a but if you index the string field you end up with the database doing scans on numeric indexes problems you may have had with your decimals as strings probably have to do with the floating point data types in which the server essentially estimates the value of the field and only retains accuracy to a certain number of this can lead to a whole host of rounding errors if you are concerned about the you can avoid that issue by using currency fields or the like that have static accuracy of the lol i learned this the hard did a great job addressing everything

 using you can instantiate datatable rather than the whole in if the datatable is it comes with dataset by 2005 and you get just the at your data access layer for filling the datasets or most often the case that there is too much data coming make your queries more sure the code using does not do goofy things like copy the datasets when passed make sure using statements or dataviews to filter and rather than making a whole lot of quick for if having trouble with use items 2 and this would be the case regardless of what type of data transport object get good at if not familiar with you can do silly like with then write articles about how they which are really articles about how little you know about really quite useful and simple to a couple typed save you gobs of coding and which helps with simple using typed make sure you modify the generated code if using you can put any custom business object behavior in the partial class for the ds the code dataview and wherever you find yourself looping through datarow around for a good code generation tool and build a rational data access framework for filling and updating from the one of the issues is that designers tie the design of the ds directly to tables in the making the design brittle to data structure if you do build or use a code generator to build your data access layer from the like start by looking at some of the codesmith templates for generating stored procs and data access when talking to someone about the object in this case is the not the and because of the partial classes you can put behavior on the getting you of the benefits of for those who love writing a a

 view has always been that the appropriate way to handle this depends on the target audience and how your class is going to be the caller of your is going to realize that they are calling into win32 in one form or i would use option you have this seems the most to if this is the name your class in a manner that makes it clear that the win32 api is going to be used that being there are exceptions in the bcl that actually subclass win32exception to be more instead of just wrapping for socketexception derives from never personally used that but it does seem like a potentially clean way to handle the caller of your class is going to have no idea that calling into the win32 api i would handle the and use a more descriptive exception you for if using your and no indication that using the win32 api using it internally for some i would have no reason to suspect that i may need to handle a you could always document but it seems more reasonable to me to trap it and give an exception that would have more meaning in your specific business in this i might wrap the initial win32exception as an inner exception your case but depending on what caused the internal i might there are many times when a win32exception would be thrown from a native but there are other exceptions in the bcl that are more this is the case when calling into a native api that but there are similar functions that are wrapped in the in that i would probably trap the make sure that it is what but then throw the bcl exception in its a good example of this would be to use securityexception instead of throwing a i would avoid option 2 and 3 you two throws a general exception type i would pretty much recommend avoiding that it seems unreasonable to wrap a specific exception into a more generalized three seems redundant really no advantage over option

 want to create a collection of classes that behave like math so that multiplying an object by a scalar multiplies each field by that the thing is that i want the fields to have actual instead of being treated as an original idea to implement this was creating a base class rn with the overloads and then create derived classes with the pretty something like namespace class x base return base base answer answer return operators for multiplication from maybe derived public double double return double return is double b cout do derived x cout return get a compiler error whenever i try to use of of the operators that requires gave me the following compiler in function no match for in int n x candidates think the problem is that the overloading functions deal with base objects that be converted to derived so i use them in the derived i come up with a is there a way around this or should i use a totally different is there some way that i can use to keep from having to type lots and lots of operator from a class with operator

 was wondering which is the best way to turn a string a post into a descriptive simplest way that comes to mind is by using a such static regex regex new result first not so i can strip the last and check it against my db and see if yet in that case i would add a trailing number to make it unique and could use it is this way should i check other things the length of the there any better method you way to turn a post title into an url in

 way applets work in netbeans is annoying to the suggested usage from the help is to run the applet as you indicate you did netbeans will produce an html file under that references the you then copy the html file to src where your class you can then tweak the html and in subsequent runs netbeans will use your html file instead of generating every time you run the file netbeans opens the applet viewer program that ships with you cannot control any of the arguments passed to the applet it ignores the parameters you configure in the to change the parameters passed to the applet you must edit the html file better way is to use the appletwindow classes created over at the bluej it lets you host an applet on a which means you can make a small standalone swing app which calls your the program then has a main you can launch an extra swing window with buttons and text controls to simulate javascript calls to the applet and you can tweak the attributes that get passed to the applet at very nice for trying out new things in your this jar contains the compiled files and the info about bluej and other

 way probably has pros and what i are nice because very common everybody should know how to use and manipulate the syntax can get ugly objects have great clean and also great at quickly implementing a i tried using them for something but quickly ran into some so if you need to do real with you might end up having to scrap list of objects is similar to a but lends itself to easier understanding of what trying to you have greater readability and easier but another object in your library only going to get used it might be too much typing for what a simple think used datatables like you did above one time because i know what i was if between that and a use a dictionary since more common and generic my but it really comes down to most important to you for the problem and if there are already and conventions in your current	
 way round it is to redirect the post to a page which redirects to a get see on your post is 4k of form presumably your server does something with that data rather than just displaying it once and throwing it such as saving it in a keep doing or if a huge search form create a temporary copy of it in a database that gets purged after a few days or on a lru basis when a space limit is now create a representation of the data which can be accessed using if generate an id for it and use that as the if a permanent set of data it probably has an id or something that can be used for the at the worst an algorithm like tiny url uses can collapse a big url to a much smaller redirect the post to get the representation of the a historical this technique was practice in

 way to think of a hash is like a human fingerprint are also sometimes referred to as can any person in to a unique you cannot know who someone is by their fingerprint this is just like a you can easily work out but given only you cannot trivially tell the source reverse a finger you need to compare the fingerprint to a database of known the unknown fingerprint matches the unknown fingerprint belongs to a again you must do much the same thing you have a database with all mappings a then you lookup the row with the hash and it shows was hashed in order to get the other more common way is to simply try every combination of hash them and compare force while human fingerprints are possible to have two the just incredibly unlikely the same with some hashing algorithms are more susceptible to than question is if the hashes are all i be able to compress anything into a 40 char hashing is a great compression but to decompress is incredibly impractical beyond 10 ascii characters of you can compress anything to a 40 character but you cannot decompress it practically theoretically is a bit of a	
 way we do it at my present company is to make sure is a not a web then you use names for the folders that would help identify it as the common ones that are distinct from the individual web instead of just your other web you create a virtual directory to the and add a file based reference to the requires you to use iis for development and visual studio believe that the controls really but it will work at and you can build just fine with only warnings about or path you do use common master pages and visual studio you will need sp1 for 2008 and use a in the root of the individual web projects to go in to design i saw this on another and i am going to look into doing more like	
 way we do this in our application is using idisposable and then with blocks to ensure the cursor is reset when class overridecursor public idisposable public void then in your cursor new do override will end when the end of the using statement is reached if an exception is thrown and control leaves the statement block before the end of the prevent the cursor flickering you can class overridecursor static new public if public void cursor cursor 0 if

 we can assume order of scores in the array is always in the order by then by the round number of rounds is same for each what we can do is print each score as we moved through the array while calculating the total in the process but resetting it if we see a new as check whether we have to move to a new if check whether we have anything to print resetting the if if for print reset the total and various variables for the new the last player is not printed because we exited the loop before the print so we need a print statement print round 0 round 1 10 7 6 12 should be quite efficient because it only goes through the array

 well along in the development of our first wpf app for silverlight 3 looks but for this application i would still have chosen the application centers around presenting and manipulating very large sets of images hosted on a central server on our the software rate will be mass import of new images from a local no internet connectivity performance make this a project well suited for of our upcoming will require many remote users to access a single data store on our the data they work with requires significant validation and error so running that code locally is they will need the ability to work both on and offline and remain in synch with sql data sloob out of the will most likely be our choice for that one so they can have all the silverlight advantages but use it like a regularly installed even without an internet formats have their the trick will be to avoid using silverlight for everything we have more tools than just 1

 what you call amount of code to pass a is the whole this is consistent with its size say only a few hundred incremental approach does not claim to code first and think you can design a code it and then refine the design with special cases or better refactoring does not consist simply in adding new stuff over old for me this is a more destructive where you throw away old code for a simple feature and replace it with new code for a refined and more elaborate	
 what you created is not a variable an array whose size is not that array has an incomplete and can thus not be defined in what you can do is to make it just a declaration by putting before coords in the file that initializes you can then create that array beware you should do it at namespace outside any of what you want is an array whose size is not known at compile time but rather at you should use a coords later if you fill create a local array and then initialize the vector using a copy of the elements of that c sizeof c sizeof in it is slightly different than in you define an array whose dimension what happens is that taken to be a if at the end of the file of its translation which is that and all the files it includes meaning everything the compiler translates there is not a subsequent definition of it that includes the then the size is taken to be in there are no tentative and a definition that does not include the size and does not contain an initializer that can tell the size is an invalid the reason why your code goes you are the compiler will read set lhs to lhs is a variable of type rhs what the heck is the compiler has no clue what the right hand side is supposed to for that reason version of introduced compound it allows you to it will actually do what you want it to do creating a right hand side value of type and assigns it to the left hand but you should already from a compatibility reason c compilers are not reasonable c99 compliant and neither nor c89 supports compound use one of the previous ways i showed

 when hired on to my current company a year i was tasked with migrating our development teams from they already had it in their minds that they wanted and since i had experience using and setting up i was a good i first tried to sell tfs because it woul dhave solved the problem i am in right but since money is and subversion is well you get i have finalized the propsal and the only thing standing in the way is the proposed that we store only our source code in and all release and other project artifracts be stored in our sharepoint so we have to give non developer stakeholders access to when i presented the all was excepted but the question arose about how to manage the syncronization between the artifacts how to is document x version associated with release my initial reaction is to create a section in the sharepoint porject page for each new release that will hold the artificats keep track of changes is there a better way of doing does anyone know of anyone doing or any integration packages to sync svn with is some info on the companies development all of our software is for internal we sell none of so our customers are all we have 2 types of those who take care of maintainance and customization of third party and those who write proprieatry software is where i our software we write is mostly but the 3rd party software is all over the board other crap that no ones cares about as i need to get this submitted i hate and i need management with subversion and sharepoint

 whole heartily join the recommendation to manually change the crt version you link if for some reason i cannot this is the right course of action for the way to do so is change the for your make sure a manifest is generated on every build configuration as it would overwrite your manual also make sure there that isolation is locate the manifest file should be at the you should see a section similar to debug of you need to edit the version and publickeytoken attributes of the crt can inspect the files at your local folder to see the versions check how to extract the publickeytoken once you find the version you first try and look directly into manifests of other linking against your desired crt you do go expect some rough you may have some luck if your application is a console app that does not link against other components if your application is be surprised if there some intricate version dependencies amont the sxs also need to distribute with your application the specific crt who did

 whole reason to have accessors and modifiers is to provide yourself with an extra level of extra level of indirection allows you to provide a read only view of your variable to a public while not allowing your data member to be you could still use a private or protected allow you to do special error validation and corrections when a value is for example you could make sure there is a terminating slash if the user specify this ensures that your class state will always be can also shield your members from having them exposed to allow pointers to by not allowing pointers to them from the you can ensure that if your object goes out of scope it lead to a extra level of indirection for also allow you to be able to change the data member that they a getter you can also obtain different views of your when your data member is actually stored in is not the reason to use but a nice side effect of using getters and setters is that you can set a breakpoint inside your modifier for example to see exactly when it is you should use them or not is a judgement call based on your if you have so many members that it is a huge pain to provide getters and settings you could consider storing the data members in a struct and using that struct inside your class you could even provide for an object for the whole struct at

 will be split when it hits a network device with a lower mtu then the packets most ethernet devices are but it can often be 1492 if that ethernet is going over pppoe because of the extra routing even lower if a second layer is added like windows internet connection and dialup is normally general though you should remember that is not a packet it uses packets at the lowest level to transmit over but as far as the interface for any tcp stack is it is a stream protocol and has no requirement to provide you with a relationship to the physical packets sent or received example most stacks will hold messages until a certain period of time has or there are enough messages to maximize the size of the ip packet for the given an example if you sent two your send function the receiving program might only receive 1 receiving tcp stack might combine them if you are implimenting a message type protocol over you should include a header at the beginning of each message some other so that the receiving side can split the tcp stream back into individual either when a message is received in two or when several messages are received as a

 working on a video display device that uses custom timings for resolutions at848x480 and 800x480 that do not conform to any vesa the device has an edid that specifies these would like to know the process that windows xp uses to determine the resolution to display and how it presents the user with a list of this seems highly dependent on the video card manufacturer and have observed wildly different behaviors on different seems that vanilla windows xp does not query the edid except at boot however laptops and custom video drivers sometimes seem to query the edid at will in a computer with no hit presentation and the device name shows pcs seem to have no trouble generating 848x480 or but some just seem to ignore the detailed timings and fall back to a vesa if you specify a custom timing what is the chance that any given video will be able to generate the proper vga often the edid information will be transmitted to the but if you open the windows display and select the device in the settings the slider of available modes does not show either 848x480 or it usually just shows 640x480 among a list of other standard modes not the custom modes this then you can often get the device to display at 848x480 or 800x480 by selecting it in the list of all modes under display properties settings advanced adapter list all when you select it switches to the proper if you go back in to display properties you will see the mode you selected in the but the slider only has the one it should also show is this just a fact of life when dealing with windows xp and video it would be great to know exactly how windows populates that would greatly appreciate any resources that discuss the details associated with all of i know that this is not strictly speaking a programming but it is closely related to a programming problem that i am and i am having trouble finding any information on this does windows xp use a edid to determine allowable display

 working on a win32 application for which trying to essentially if a device has been plugged into one of the rs232 ports and then if it has been checking for a connected device is easy enough because my use case allows me to assume that this particular thread will be the first to try to initiate communication with the able to scan the available ports every minute or so and once found a port with the device on it i flag that port has having a close the then set an event so that the process that actually will use the device knows it can now connect on that disconnect detect is where i run into when scanning for connected devices i can actually send data to the port to be sure if there is a the specific device looking but once that port will already be open by the other process and i can no longer open that port from the detect so i am looking for a way to either open the port in a or something like that so i can just see if the device is still briefly came across something about watching the dsr or dtr line or find any more or how to actually do looks like i need to clarify a little for detecting the i send data to the rs232 port any i cannot assume that another application actually has the port the device may be physically but without and open i still risk sending data to i was hoping there was a way to just check that there was still power on that port or something like if device is to rs232 port without opening the	
 working on a windowing application for a website of right i have each individual window set up as a in the body of the i add new windows by literally adding the appropriate code to the end of the body and delete them by removing that using jquery for the underlying javascript found that for each i want to be able to store some values that used say i maximize a i would want to save its old position and size so that when i it returns to its old position and not just to somewhere so my real question here would it be legal to create custom css attributes full well that the browser would ignore with the sole purpose of keeping information like this on a or would this be and should i look at another certainly with methods of keeping all of this in an array so the system can run blind with but lovely and prone to errors and and it would still be a bit tricky to work it legal to create your own css

 working on an application written in we are currently using xcopy deployment for all of our operations and everything is peachy we can run on machines with no oracle client previously that until we came to the part of the application which depends on a library written in which cannot use the least amount of stuff we have to install in order to get an oledb or odbc provider for oracle additional believe that any oledb or odbc provider will be good enough for these purposes performance a big definitely need to use the 11 client for stuff because using we just install the big 10 eventually going to have an so important that we can install whatever we need to via the command the smallest footprint necessary to use an unmanaged oracle

 works on potentially multiple so whenever your define these kinds of things or the current sdk root is prepended to the actual path getting passed to the one way to make this work would be to add your directory to the for assuming building with the mac os x you could add your opt library would now be found on your you want to do then you will have to look at cmake and find out how to get it to generate a library requirement for your actual library know anything about so i help you this is also why you see a difference between and re your other another you could also specify this path with the build would cause the linker to search as well as its standard paths and require you to generate a different project

 would point out that dynamic languages can have their types implicitly defined by the the same as a static nice thing about dynamic languages is that you can write method stubs that call objects and methods that do not actually this can be nice for designing the code first and filling in the details good when you are working in worry if you do this the compiler will usually give you a warning that the method call probably the compiler will let you code and run that code languages are although the power can make them harder to debug at

 would recommend using subsites or site collections for each meta project site can be defined which can rollup important information for the project the project site can then store more than just the but can become a focus for the project advice is that performance starts to suffer if you use more than site so there is some flexibility can swiftly become unmanageable when storing many documents as there is no good way of moving a subsite between content databases when a content database grows too think the site collection per project architecture will give you greater flexiblity and abvoid the nasty issues with complex lookup it will rely on some fairly clever use of the search results webpart

 would seem to me that many large enterprises already have robust directory services such as active directory and it would be silly to constantly duplicate users in an if you require duplicating the user you can provide a mechanism to authenticate against active you could support a sso mechanism that leverages for the xacml duplicating information on roles and entitlements is equally for the spml many enterprise leverage identity management toolkits and would at least like out of the box integration in terms of centralized management and why open source projects considering this type of functionality as a default to getting on the radar within an enterprise come open source applications that are targeted at have these security

 wpf use the installed color profile in windows for correcting the colors that are pretty sure old applications are not color but i wonder if wpf does can be made to this know i can do this manually in my own wpf apps by creating a gpu shader to do the color reason i ask is because more and more monitors are now wide this means that colors that look on monitors will seem much more vibrant on wide gamut an example is my new monitor which has much stronger red and green colors than my other can correct this problem on a basis for some applications media players using a custom shader my own wpf apps using gpu but it would be nice if there was a way to have wpf do it automatically for all wpf is not a big problem but it is however annoying and i had hoped that microsoft would take the opportunity with wpf to introduce color correction by question clarified for wpf use the installed color in

 writing an application that manipulates some sort of social network so the ideal underlying data structure is weighted directed like to do the manipulation directly on the without first loading the entire graph into memory and serializing could be simulated using a standard sql or but that would be very inefficient the algorithms like to shortest half a mind to write my own since googling turn up any useful but much rather use an existing solution there is any and i missed than reinvent the the project is for fun personal so the software would have to be open source prefferably capable of running under are there any projects that would fit the above for open source graph in data database

 written a few programs along these suggest all you need to to is keep a list of times that events are and every x amount of time on your check your list for you can pick up some optimization if you can guarantee the list is and that each event on the list is due exactly if you have recurring you have to make sure you cover your what i mean if you have an event that is due at and checking every then possible that you could check at and then not again until due to the inprecision of the cpu so need to be sure that one of those checks or still picks up the and that only one of them does you run at both and advantage this approach has over checking only on times you know to be on your list is that allows your list to be modified by 3rd parties without your and your event handler will continue to

 yes and no as per comments are fundamental differences and xml is a particularly suitable for textual documents various kinds of office good enough for many other problems mostly arise for it having hierarchic model relational as in or as in oo is an meaning it has bit more natural fit for handling use cases where xml sort of but where there is more cost in overcoming impedance between object and hierarchic is not a perfect fit still not objects do full but it is more natural than as it is easier to build tools to do good decent and simple data plenty room for and i would expect both to be used for long time to always in optimal but both can do plenty of use cases well what it is since writing my original i have seen json absolutely annihilate xml for use cases for companies i have worked soap will start significantly and old data interchange with restish for java for will take yet xml is much better for textual

 you already have to implement code to handle a layer on top of your my not store the actual not needed for you need the actual for each starting at output not output then encode both child nodes first then the same do if then read return new node around it with no bit was decode left and right the same and return new node around them with those but no is basically any node that have this you can calculate the exact size of your output before writing to figure out if the gains are enough to justify the this assumes you have a dictionary of pairs that contains the frequency of each where frequency is the actual number of for 10 each in freq calculation takes the leaf and nodes into and one less inline node than there are would be number of and those two would give you the number of bits total that my approach for the tree the encoded data will is a that would yield the from root down to that character in the a to do which assumes one character is just a simple bitwriter if read it back if return new node leftchild node rightchild return new example use node class public byte public node public node public node node value leftchild rightchild public boolean return leftchild a sample output from a specific character is just 8 so the size of the tree will be 10 5 1 49 tree could look like 12 c e b 6 5 1 the paths to each character is as follows is 1 is to calculate the output 6 occurances 2 bits 12 1 occurance 3 bits 3 6 occurances 2 bits 12 2 occurances 3 bits 6 5 occurances 2 bits 10 of encoded bytes is 43 that to the 49 bits from the and the output will be 92 or 12 compare that to the 20 8 bytes necessary to store the original 20 characters save 8 final including the tree to begin is as each character in the stream is encoded as 8 whereas 0 and 1 is just a single the space in the stream is just to separate the tree from the encoded data and does not take up any space in the final the concrete example you have in the you will get 3 2 b c d e 1 1 1 1 001a1b001c1d01e1f 59 000001100101110111 18 59 18 77 bits 10 the original was 7 characters of 8 bits you will have too much overhead of such small pieces of

 you are covering 2 tables there is afaik only 2 ways to enforce as you view with unique constraint accross the 3 far as reliability is concerned i would go for the indexed view but the only downside is that it will be difficult to understand by third	
 you are creating destroying tables programmatically during the normal operation of your i would say this is a very bad sign that something in the database design is systems can and do handle tables with that many to make any meaningful sorts of queries on that number of you really do have to choose your indexes carefully and i you really have to know intimately how the table will be i dare say it would be a good deal less complicated to implement than the approach you proposed of creating new tables arbitrarily based on ids or numbers with less complication comes greater ease of and less chance that introduce nasty bugs that are hard to you are really keen on splitting into multiple then i suggest that you look into how other people do rather than creating tables create a fixed number of tables from the based on how many you think you are likely to and allocate records to those tables based not on some arbitrary thing like how many records are in the tables at the but on something predictable the zip code is an example or the category the document is or the domain name or country of the user who created or something logical that you can use to easily determine where a record ended up and it will be reasonably spread of the benefits of data partitioning this where you create all the partitions to start is that if you need to in future relatively easy to move to multiple database if you are creating and destroying tables going to make that less

 you assume that all nodes are in the real they normally you can always walk or call a this you could simply change your model the following you have one graph for each transportation the nodes that are at the same place are connected with edges of weight 0 if you are dropped off by car at an airport or train label each vertex and edge with the transportation type and you can simply use existing routing by the will not scale well to really big to get something that software like maps actually would have a look the work of this research group includes the winner of the shortest path

 you could generate the by one of the advantages of a is that it guessable given record there is usually little point an checking for record re as long as you have a index on this not sure that this is an you normally put a clustered index on a so the table will be a heap you have a separate clustered such as an in which case you will be adding to the and inserting the new into the no real problem of using the time directly is that you introduce a lot more risk of you would need to worry about creation avoiding repetition when creating a few in which means etc and it gets even more troublesome if multiple machines are working intensively in parallel chances are get	
 you could implement multiple classes that conform to the uiapplicationdelegate protocol only the would receive these a protocol to create a delegate is only one part of the that delegate then has to be registered with the code generating the messages and these systems generally only support one the case of uiapplication you can change the delegate using the property in the uiapplication shared class but this will replace the original not add an additional you need to broadcast uiapplication level messages to other systems then this is functionality you should add to your existing	
 you could solve shortest path problems with negative weights you would find a longest the two are this could be done by putting a weight of instead of standard algorithm for negative weights is the however the algorithm will not work if there is a cycle in the graph such that the sum of edges is in the graph that you all such cycles have negative sum weights and so the algorithm unless of course you have no in which case you have a tree a and the problem is solvable via dynamic we replace a weight of w by which guarantees that all weights will be then the shortest path can be found via standard if the shortest path p in this graph has k edges then the length is where is the length of the path with the original this path is not necessarily the longest of all paths with k p is the longest

 you derive from the existing membership why would your class have to be recompiled when another provider changes not using the whole idea of the provider model is that the contract any changes to the base membership provider would be since the contract must remain and your provider must do the so it can be overridden as if your provider simply newmembershipprovider custom cleanly abstracted the implementation one can change without affecting the and any future changes can do the same by overriding your	
 you describe is a pretty classic state you have states navigation but also you can have things like actions and transition that worth thinking about your do you simply want a list of navigation options dynamically added to the or is there some extra smarts think of the navigation is information is required for the the you might want to bring with you to the next navigation created state maps before by simply using	
 you describe often refers to the following you use a com server com object instantiated in a separate process rather then in the same process as your and for some reason that com server encounters a fatal error and terminates the com object you were using no longer since rpc is used for interacting with com servers and the server side no longer exists after termination you receive the error message saying that the rpc server is unavailable which is true but looks have to research and eliminate the reason of com server the most likely reasons are the unreasonable input values you pass to the calls unhandled exception in an event if you have any handling for events fired from a com component you should catch all the exceptions that may be thrown inside your handler and not let them propagate outside the	
 you develop in your career as a simply grow in awareness of more reasonable approaches to various in most cases i can think enhancement work resulted in code that was actually smaller and simpler than some complex tangle that evolved from working through a as you get such faster solutions just become easier and more natural to voting for everyone on the thread so far because the answers are so in dwc has captured the essence of my position with some wonderful

 you dispose of it once just because we have street sweepers mean we should just go around littering the in the example if the font is needed for the lifetime of the object then dispose of the font in that there are many things that would simplify my code but that justify those changes sometimes there are things that you should even though a always a good idea to tidy up after when you no longer need dispose of that way you can avoid nasty race out of memory drawing and garbage find that best practice to dispose of disposable objects if you no longer need them unless there is a justifiable reason not to as you own the it is more difficult to track down the root cause of a problem than it is to code defensively up regards to call dispose before you release your last reference to the the resources it is using will not be freed until the garbage collector calls the font finalize say what the resources are but the fact that they explicitly state that this should be done implicitly adds importance to calling

 you do this with the entity can you do this with the entity framework that is much problem having is that the column exists in the storage schema in your removing the column with the gui designer simply removes it from the client not the mapping or the storage simple enough to go into the edmx and remove having done you can also remove it from the mapping in the client schema portions of the and the entity framework will longer complain that it is when you use the gui designer to update the edmx from the the storage schema is thrown away and so your column will come as far as i there is no way to tell the gui designer to never map a particular so you will have to this every time you update with the gui the edmx is so you can do this with a xml or the xml tool of your

 you each different actual template makes an entirely new which has relation inheritance relation with any any other with a diffent actual made from that except that each provides the same so that a you can handle then the neither the static types or the dynamic types have any me drop back and i declare a pointer to has what we call a static of if class bar is a subclass of and i point fp at new new we say that the object pointed to by fp has the dynamic type of bar2 also publicly derives from i can do new without ever even knowing what fp points i can call virtual methods declared in and have the compiler make sure that the method defined in he dynamic type pointed to is a typename t struct baz void and are two different class with no only is that i can call on but since the static types have no if i have a i point it to a not even with a the compiler has no way to a call to the baz dosotheing method into a call to a because is no there is no there are ony and and but no common baz is not a baz is a a set of instructions about how to make a class if and only if we have a t parameter bound to an actual type to a there is one way i can treat those in a they present the same and the if it knows what kind of baz really dealing can make a call to that method a static access of a member a template is not a template is the instructions of how to synthesize a a in a template is not a an instruction of how to write the code to make a that was long winded and outside of a template there is no relationship between a paramvector and so your assignment with partial application of you can write a which gives a of how to transform a to a notice the t and the if you can write code to turn any kind of regardless of actual template parameter into any other kind of you can package that up as a partially applied and the compiler will add that function for probably involves making a and transforming each t in the into a u to put in the which still let you asign to a maybe you want to have both templates and in that you can same that all paramvectors regardless of type inherit from some and then there would be a relationship between all be sibling subclasses of that base

 you followed all the instructions on it seems to cover more registry settings than what you as you point looks like that page is for annoying how msft culls legacy information and makes it downright hard to thing to check is the event logs maybe they contain a it may be possible to crank up the auditing level to see more have your code so i debug it but i was able to hook a debugger into and get control at the point it launches the utilities on the secure maybe if you do this you can figure out the security the target the debugging tools for rdp the to bring up the utility manager and leave it sure your symbols and source are visible on the target at the same path that they were compiled on the dev another into the target computer as a user with the rdp windbg and attach to the utilman process it break into the press to ensure your utility gets loaded into this debugger instance when it to continue on the target computer console your utility from the utility the debugger the rdp should break inside the new process and you should be able to debug from have visual studio on the machine where i tried this if you have vstudio on the target machine you can probably use it instead of your utility even then windows is doing some kind of validation prior to the call to the security logs might be able to help you i tried using the utility to locate the program that generates the dialog but on an english winxp so i have the actual i also looked for hardcoded with no you can figure out what exe is putting up that dialog perhaps you should be able to attach to it with the debugger and walk back up the stack to find the check that errors once you have the general vicinity of the check that you should be able to set a breakpoint earlier in the codepath that should break into the debugger the next time you try to you should be able to step through the failing check from for all of make sure you have the since it should make the much easier to not familiar with whether your debugger has support for the symbol

 you go for mutability then you will find that whenever you need to call a method that you want to have the object or you need to return an object that is part of the internal you need to make a defensive you really look at programs that make use of mutible objects you will find that they are prone to by passed to passed to returned from issue show up very often because most programs change the data are in reality immutable by virtue of them never personally make every thing i possibly can i probably have of all variables marked as there are some cases where it has to be but the vast majority of cases it does think it might depend on your if you are writing libraries for 3rd parties to use you think about this much more than if you are writing an application that only you your will find that you can write large scale applications using immutable objects for the majority of the system without too much

 you have a table rules with 3 columns and as data enters the i want to know if any row of the rules table matches my data with the condition that if the corresponding column in the rules table is all data the obvious sql from or a is and or b is and or c is if i have a b 50 null 51 xyz 51 null null xyz input of will match rules 1 and is there a better way to do with only 3 fields this is no but the actual table will have 15 columns and i worry about how well that sql an alternative sql statement i came up with involved adding an extra column to the table with a count of how many fields are not in the this columns value for rules is 2 and 2 with this the select could from when a then 1 else 0 when b then 1 else 0 when c then 1 else 0 i have enough sample data to find our which of these approaches would perform before i start creating random i thought ask here whether there was a better data mining techniques and column constraints are not feasible the data must be checked as it enters the system and so it can be flagged the users control the addition or removal of rules so i convert the rules into column constraints or other data definition last in the end i need a list of all the rules that the data fails to the solution cannot abort at the first there a good way to check rules against n	
 you have a very large and to simplify lets say it consists of one major table you will be doing your lookups on with one only primary key field the fact that all lookups are going to be basically from where what is the best way to optimize this database for the fastest just a few more details and are going to be very so i mind sacrificing performance there to achieve better lookup seems like clustering is the way to do you have any examples of the kind of increase in performance i can achieve with this and how exactly is this done any kind of optimizing a large db for primary key

 you have an answer that is not java sqlite be pleased to read store items in a database with the following scheme item this is the primary if it the id of the item containing this date an ordinary foreign key to a pair of named geocontext this is the primary name way for the user to label a pair of coordinates x one of the y the other must filter the items according to the geocontext and the it would be a easy job if items were all at the same but the trick is 2 is no explicit limit to the recursive if we are in any node and filter with the date of we must see not only the items directly contained in the node that match the but must see the items that contain items matching the date as we are in if matches the then we consider matches the date too and we must keep if we are at the then item 2 must be goes for the but even harder because stored in an other the context is a costly mathematical brute forcing the matching would result in the software to be slow and a very poor user need to display a i display a list of filtered data from a we must see only a flat list of the top the challenge is to decide whether to display each element or according to all the children i tried to solve thought i could ease a bit the problem by using more tables to cache flat data i can join the items table on this i can delete update a and so delete update the i can delete update a and so delete update the x i can brute force y date seems but i tried it it should the following drawbacks moved the costly process to the set create delete methods have to manage the cached will be a troublesome code and a five item will triger a process hit recursively five size ot the data base a five de depth store cached data for know if this a a app with i think insert more thatn 1000 more than 10 level of the good news is we go from bottom of the pyramid to the the other so not horrible as it when i have to deal with parent it will be another but i save it for question my would you store the data and process the filtering int the most optimal way i define an explicit recursive depth limit i perform the filtering using sql or java sql surely will be but matching the geocontext is far easier to do in i am working on the android i have the following constraints is the only language not with the entire standard is the only dbms and memory are in case you have to life and is the external libs may not be be i dug into so and found some interesting pieces of information a but not a problem data processing performance using java and

 you have three it on the server and accept those i know from experience that things do go but depending on how and high priority the tasks doing it may be something you can live basically if you have to do try to do as little word integration as if just a mail merge then you will probably get away without any problems of the a but from except for simple these never do the job quite for example if talking about something that will generate pdfs from word documents on the it will never look the same as it does in of directly invoking use the to manipulate the documents even written stuff in vb6 that manipulates 2007 since all in documented xml you to use the 2007 but fast and but something like a mail merge have to do manually i so it may not be this solution is generally better for manipulating documents rather than replacing word api personal experience done the first and it worked well enough for our customer to i messed around with the second and was never and done the third with great success a fair bit of people do all sorts depending on cost suggest option 1 or 2 for a fast less or 3 for a more reliable

 you just tell the models that there have to be columns in the database for it you set up related rails assumes followed a convention which allows it to find the things you what set up the conventions in you name the table in a predictable way plural in this when you have a relationship to another you have to create that column and name it in another predictable way if relating to the write a model class inheriting from person you instantiate one of these the constructor looks at the name of the converts it to lowercase and pluralizes by reading it yields the name of the table we created now activerecord knows where to get all the information about a and it can read the sql output to figure out what the columns add relationships to the or you type something it assumes a few name of the model that you relate to is bankaccount name of the column in the table which refers to a bank account is singularizing the relationship is activerecord knows to give you methods like using plural names for all of that activerecord knows how to make sql queries that will give you a bank it knows where to find because you followed a naming convention that it understands when you created the table and its of the neat things about ruby is that you can run methods on a whole and those methods can add other methods to a exactly what and friends are

 you know how to structure your code in java or then you can follow the same principles with c the only difference is that you have the compiler at your side and you need to do everything extra carefully there are no packages and you need to start by carefully designing your the most common approach is to create a separate source folder for each you need to rely on naming conventions for differentiating code between different for example prefix all functions with the name of the have classes with but you can easily implement data you create a and file for every abstract data if you prefer you can have two header one public and one the idea is that all constants and functions that need to be exported go to the public header tools are also very a useful tool for c is which can help you find bad smells in your another tool you can use is which can help you generate

 you mention i will assume you are new to ddd ddd compliments the in mvc by placing logic where it i think a good amount could be applied strict ddd i would use your movie example as an aggregate root ddd within you would have business logic that obtain the categories and related entities directly related to movie this assumes the list you want to display is a list of categories this movie is class private public you can use return public void you can treat categories as a value object a ddd here if you have an identity on what gets more interesting is if you do want to keep an identity on your treating them as aggregate roots with multiple entities and relations to other vos and in this you would want to utilize the ddd concept of services to combine the two aggregates into your requested model you want to pass to your this allows you to create business rules around loading the class class class moviecategory private public return internal class public moviecategory moviecategory mc do some logic some to obtain your categories maybe cats return concept is that you now have logic in the domain in this to handle the complex creation of these or using factories to create complex types as gives you a model you can pass around to different view and final step in your original post is how to get this into the been playing with the viewmodel approach to this creating viewmodels either or as a and hanging all of the entities on this a recent stackoverflow question hits on this passed the model directly into and i am now trying this it does clean things as your domain model really should be disconnected from the on your i find myself i need to get this partialview populated based on this guess that means another method on the going the viewmodel approach removes the from the domain and puts it where it belong in the layer of where you are your

 you need to make a as in find the bottom of the range by then count inserting or deleting a node is stbuton makes a good point that if you want to allow duplicates seems plausible for datestamped then you want a you do not need to make a sorted array vector or find the location of the start of the range by binary then count inserting or deleting is in the duplicates are performance of lookups is the same in both log where m is the size of the but the array uses less memory per and be faster to count through the because after the binary chop just forward sequential memory access rather than following both cases you can arrange for insertion at the end to be for the keep a record of the end element at the and you get an for the grow it exponentially and you get amortised this is useful if the changes you make are always or a new event with the current since time is a if using system time then of course have to to avoid accidents when the clock resets an sql and let the database optimise how it and bigtable structure is specifically designed to make queries by ensuring that the result of any query is always a consecutive sequence from a index	
 you need to share updating data between the instances where the updates are frequent and ipc would be too in that case multithreading is probably otherwise you have to weigh whether the robustness of separate processes or the ease of thread is more important to	
 you need to validate that the file is a valid image format then you are going to have to have some sort of code try and parse the contents according to the type of the file you are to do you would call the static fromfile method on the image class to try and get an image could check the first few bytes to see if the marker for a particular image format is there but just like checking the file it guarantee that the contents are a valid image you need validation checking the file extension or mime type is just

 you never add a assignment operators or virtual functions to your structure using for allocation is frowned upon in but i consider the usage of it okay if you document it in the comments to your unsigned int unsigned int i remember right declaring an array without a length is it works on most compilers but may give you a if you want to be compliant declare your array of length int packet return but you take the size of the structure into the code will break once you add new members to your better do it this int s sizeof sizeof packet length return write a comment into your packet structure definition that data must be the last allocating the structure and the data with a single allocation is a good you halve the number of allocations that and you improve the locality of data as this can improve the performance quite a bit if you allocate lots of does not provide a good mechanism to do so you often end up with such hacks in real world	
 you never would want to store a calculated value in a database in an ideal often necessary down here in the mud and muck of the real suggestion of a trigger is your best you may have to requery the count after each trigger since it may not always be possible to know how many rows were inserted or deleted on and you may need multiple queries if a chance that more than one of your counts could be affected by a single insert or delete since also counting specific also need an update in case one of the values your count filters on is the trigger or triggers may be able to package it all into a single could get pretty

 you only have 1 row in the the cardinality for the index should be of just counting the number of unique you think of an index as a based on buckets a then the cardinality is the number of how it when you build an index over a set of columns then the database goes over all the rows in the looking at the ordered quadruplets of those 4 for each say your table looks like b c d e 1 1 1 200 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 1 what the database looks at is just the 4 columns b c d 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 that there are only 3 unique rows those will become our but get back to in also a record or row identifier for each row in the so our original table looks like a b c d e 1 1 1 1 200 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 1 when we look at only the 4 columns of really looking also at the row a b c d 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 we want to do lookup by and not by row so we produce something like we group all the row ids of rows that have identicle values 00000001 and the values of which are and have become keys for our lookup table into the rows of the original none of this really but it should give you a good idea on how a implementation of an index might be the bottom line is cardinality just measures how many unique rows there are in an and in our example that was the number of keys in our lookup which was that

 you run an entire website off of a single and that machine is more than enough to handle your then images are not a bottleneck that needs solving right forget about s3 for as your server gets you will want your server to be spending all of its time doing server transferring static content like flat html files and images is an dumb and wasting precious active and cpu cycles on them is no by switching to your server can concentrate on doing which is whatever your program actually also has benefits of being distributed around and attached to probably a fatter pipe than your which means the images will show up slightly more quickly on your so an added is also backed which means that it makes for a pretty nice place to store pretty much any private data under the in addition to stuff that you want to serve to others confuse the permissions settings between those two things in you may want to use separate accounts is also which means that if you want to let users upload files to your site s3 is a great choice so that you have to constantly worry if your server is going to run out of disk space warning like i said at the if a setup with a handful of none of this really a tool like any and it may not be something you need

 you say do you mean code or infrastructure argue the infrastructure services and rather than the gives the most benefit to and ease of the examples you give are in the standard libraries of most languages or are very also just going to assume version control is a since its so integral to all say the important infrastructure would be a this lets people write whatever code they check it and make sure it works with everyone most important would be these let people develop faster and establish standards for and as common libraries are used the importance of the continuous build since small changes in those can cause problem with common is they take a lot of effort to design well so worth reusing and it takes a long time to get them to that most will start as specific to a and then someone will hack it into their followed by some then copy and after years someone will audit the code and start merging them into a common a plan should be made for upgrading common libraries and how to have two versions of them at another hidden drawback is they allow faster development in the short but hinder development in the long as people become locked into older versions is more true of third party would be this means common tools to simplify checking and otherwise having to interact with the code in any things that automate marking bugs as resolved when you submit a or notify continuous builders that dependencies have or automatically running tests before you submit a making tests easy to would be which is a simple extension of build this means that an app is self this has two machine reuse is and more its incredibly easy for a developer to get started they need to install extra or change something in or set something in their environment it just builds and i can think if everything uses the same monitoring then people have to monitor common it also makes it easier to identify problems since all the data is in one grepping and groking logs is a having a centralized place where all logs get stored in a structured format makes it easy to search and find on a large this lets developers testers and releasers release without stepping on each

 you sure you want to use that will be a which will be if already decided on a 9x9 convolution you need any the cheapest way to do convolution in c is to set up a loop that moves a pointer over the summing the convolved values at each point and writing the data to a new this loop can then be parallelised using your favourite method mpi the you assume the values to be 0 outside the then add a 4 element border of 0 to your 2d array of this will avoid the need for statements to handle the which are your data wraps at the boundaries it is then use a modulo or add a 4 element border which copies the opposite side of the grid fgabcdefgab for 2 this is what you are implicitly assuming with any kind of fourier including if that is not the you would need to account for it before any fft is 4 points are because the maximum boundary overlap of a 9x9 kernel is 4 points outside the main n points of border needed for a x you need this convolution to be really your grid is consider partitioning it into smaller pieces that can be held in the and thus calculated far more this also goes for any you might want to do are ideal for this type of

 you using a validation summary on your some javascript to automatically scroll to the top of the which may well override the automatic behaviour of the client side validation to focus the last invalid have you turned client side validation you take a look at the javascript generated by the client side validation you should see methods like if if if null the call to which is a rather long method that attempts to set the focus to the control in or if you have multiple to the last control that was using the following get this behaviour to you would ideally need to ensure that all your validators are set to be server side validators will obviously require a and that might affect things lose and setting maintainscrollpositiononpostback to true would probably cause the page to reload to the submit rather than the invalid form the server side method will cause to render out some javascript the page near the bottom of the but this could be being overriden by one of the other mechanisms dicussed	
 you using any sophisticated technique to track the scope of than valgrind is not smart though you can try by setting xscale related option with	
 you using java concurrent from the documentation it appears to behave in a fashion which find a set view of the keys contained in this the set is backed by the so changes to the map are reflected in the and the set supports element which removes the corresponding mapping from this via the and clear it does not support the add or addall the returned iterator is a iterator that will never throw and guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon construction of the and may is not guaranteed reflect any modifications subsequent to you can remove stuff and you should be not using this then which are you using why not being but it would be interesting to know why made that

 you verified the second line actually it should not compile because does not support assigning a lambda expression to an implicitly typed variable this line will work in though because it supports anonymous delegate creation in vb rhino mocks version does not compile for the same reason the second line should not will not automatically infer a type for a lambda lambda expressions must be used in a context where it is possible to determine the delegate type they are intended to the first line works great because the intended type is the rhino mocks version does not work because delegate is more akin to an abstract delegate it must be a concrete delegate type such as action or a detailed discussion on this you should read eric blog entries on the

 you want formatting c has more assignment operators than just and these are great for things like x most c provide a which looks like that does the same thing as x and is syntaxtic but sugar is at c and many other languages provide a special case for the operator from which gets its so x can be rewritten as with the same that there is a major difference between and but that matter for use whichever one you and make sure to put it on its own line all by itself until you learn the difference between and you find you have a variable using use instead of sizeofa argc printf sumofa argc printf sumofa printf sumofa you should not be blindly passing it your entire arguments only the argument you want to convert at this current but another and i suppose you change this seems like a battle for another why is this a community wiki i think your logic is off if you start at i think you want to stop 1 before the end of the but this is a simple error and you can fix that later when you know for sure that that in the i suggest you define a instead of the elements of the simply go through the add the numeric value of each one to an at the print out but maybe missing the point of the each time you iterate through the print out so you can see the value grow correctly each i think this is closer to what you actually want to do in the but i take time to check because i have a class to go	
 you want full type i think you can do better without some kind of wrapper why not make those classes the original generic like class foobbq extends eliminates the need for and it is more in my that it is just a type generic type can be cast into without a compiler it would be my personal preference to make if even if some code duplication would occur in without knowing concrete problem it is hard to say whether you say like in your or perhaps class extends the other have you thought about simply configuring java compiler not to show some of the generic and simply omit the parts of generic use strategically placed in other can you make only doableimpl implements ignore the warnings for the sake of less code hard to decide without a concrete but it is yet another thing you can

 you want one set of tables with poolid poolname as thetxi use separate databases rather than multiple tables that all do the same you restrict the variation between the accessing of different pools to the initial you have to recode your selects each or have dynamic other advantages of this approach of a database little bit more admin but not know what your application but really really think carefully before creating all of the tables in one that way madness if performance is the only thing that concerns you need to measure take a representative set of queries and measure their the difference in performance for a single query between the many databases model will be if you have one you can tune the hell out of if you have many you can tune the hell out of all of speak for anyone point is for well tuned there will be practically no difference in performance between the three options in multiple multiple so you can pick the option which is easiest for in the short and long the best option is still one database with as thetxi then multiple depending upon your if you need to know exactly what the difference in performance is between two we give you that you need to set it up and test multiple it becomes easy to throw hardware at it to improve

 you want to add a new method that is accessible to every string then doing it the way you have it is how to get it good practice is to put your extensions to core objects in a separate file or a or this it is obvious what has been and it is easy for someone to see how they have been extended or monkey patching can go bad is when you change some existing behavior of a core object that causes some other code that expects the original functionality to

 you want to create a managed front end for a native you will have to marshal data back and there is really no way to avoid this currently facing a similar issue in one of our current the approach taken is to use pinvoke to talk managed with a few we only pinvoke blittable types which helps reduce the cost of marshaling because the clr can just implement it as a memory communicating native we use com we try to apply the same rules with regards to but found that you often have to include many com objects in this scenario which prevents this approach worked quite well from we spent a bit of time up front getting the primitives defined for the data but after marshalling became routine for lack of a better an overhead but a lot cheaper than a full

 you want to develop an air you must use the air if you want to develop a flex application that runs on you need to use believe joshtnjala to be partially but i wanted to add on if using the flex you no longer require the air sdk as those tools are available to the flex it is important to because i see a lot of confusion or misuse of the flex is actually three sdk developers without the flash flex to develop and actionscript3 and mxml code to flash content for one could use flashdevelop for an and compile the code using the flex adobe flex is a open source framework for building highly expressive web applications that deploy consistently on all major and operating it provides a language and programming model that supports common design a declarative is used to describe ui layout and and a powerful programming is used to create client flex also includes a rich component library with more than 100 extensible ui components for creating rich internet applications as well as an interactive flex application builder builder is merely an ide to assist in the development of flash or air this builder utilizes the sdk above to the framework may or may not be used depending on the developers many developers have taken themselves out of the flash ide nasty and began scripting their as3 purely in the flex builder ide as it provides many useful features for the not to mention its a very clean ui and is built on eclipse so it has many plugins and a solid community behind its being to expand on what joshtnala the difference between using the air skd and the flex is that if you merely want to build an air composed of actiosncript3 the air sdk is all you need if you intend to use mxml and any part of the then you must use the flex sdk this will allow you to use the many available components such as in your air so in the both will develop an air application as flex sdk incorporates the air development abstract your project figure out what you will if a component works for or if a custom implementation is then choose your this

 you want to get down to uses an inverted index of the what this means is that google has an index of all pages crawled based on the terms in each for instance the term maps to this the google home and the wikipedia article for amongst when you go to google and type into the search google checks its index of all terms available on the internet and finds the entry for the term and with it the list of all pages that have that term referenced in veteran index goes beyond your simple inverted this is why google is the crawlers are very beyond just keeping track of the terms that are on any given web they also keep track of words that are on related pages and link those to the given other if a page has the term in it and the page has a link to or is linked from another web the other page may be referenced in the index under the term as all this and more go into why a given page is returned for a given you want to go into why pages are ordered the way they are in your search that gets into even more interesting get down to one of the most basic algorithms a search engine can use to sort your results is known as term document frequency simply this means that your results will be ordered by the relative importance of your search terms in the in other a document that has 10 pages and lists the word once is not nearly as important as a document that has 1 page and lists the word ten veteran google does quite a bit more than your basic search engine when it comes to ranking google has implemented the pagerank in short pagerank enhances the algorithm by taking into account the of a given at this may be judged by any number of factors that google just wont tell at the most basic of google can tell that one page is more important than another because loads and loads of other pages link to

 your application is under vb6 then i strongly recommend that do the redesign to a class hierarchy in vb6 the reason for this is that in any conversion you try to preserve the behavior of the old is stretches out the project time to do this and do a redesign at the same making the design changes in the applications original language first then you are assured that any bugs that result are due to the design not the done three major conversions of our software in the past 20 to to object oriented design in and to it is straight forward to make a design in vb6 that is ports over to the trick is to hide the specific vb6 apis and constructs behind a interface do the conversion i recommend working from the top change over your forms first to which calls the vb6 com then convert each layer over until you reach the bottom if you try to change the design and convert to another language for any complex application you will double the conversion	
 your application run for long periods of time or is it more of a if the i personally would consider using the while it may not be the most desirable from a perspective it is certainly straightforward to implement and may foot the bill given the way your particular application idea of a separate executable makes perhaps another option would be to use not an expert in this area welcome to but as i understand put the api call in a separate dll and load it into a separate when the api call is finished or you have to abort you can unload the appdomain along with the this have the added benefit of cleaning up resources that a straightforward will

 your coworkers that their perl looks too much like line please obfuscate your code just for the sake of obfuscation asinine development goals like that which give perl such a bad reputation for being when really bad programmers like your who write sloppy nicely and logical code is a good c is a good though the best place to figure out how to write perl is in the best by damian it tells you how he thinks you should do and he always gives good reasons for his position as well as occasionally giving good reasons to i do disagree with him on some but his reasoning is the odds that you work with anyone who knows perl better than conway are pretty and having a printed book at least a safari gives you some more solid backing for your pick up a copy of the perl cookbook while at as looking at code examples for solving common problems should get you on the right i hate to say the but those are exceptionally good books that perl developer should regards to your specific using split with no it looks plenty to my eyes which have been developing with perl for quite a one though i hate the english if you must use do it like english the option slows down regexp parsing and the variables it provides usually

 your first question about generically retrieving a search ldap directory server to the ldap protocol i exposes some operational thingies under a node called one of the things you can retrieve through are the which essentially can tell you what the different trees are hosted on this you can retrieve a search base for your be some ldap for servers can host multiple trees so you have to come up with a solution when multiple naming contexts are can be retrieved by querying the server for the dn and specifiyng that you want to get all the operational attributes as just some example for an openldap base note the returns operational should return something similar to that shown below openldap the values in parentheses are added explanations and are not returned by the rfc your second question about the availability of the think that you should rely on this one as it strongly depends on the schema used for storing user data most will have a attribute i but that depends on the flexibility you want to put into your perhaps the best way would be to make the configurable by the could even do this with the search base which would have some performance advantages need to search the whole tree when users are only located in a small subtree and no need to query the

 your own product your is part of quality assurance and i would put it under informal testing category as opposed to more formal testing usually done by a separate qa your is aimed at giving a experience of using a product or service to people directly responsible for its design and for a feature rich application it might go deeper than formal testing and at the same time put a specific user when the formal testing normally covers breadth of software use cases and tries to operate in more objective and measurable annoyances that make is also a category of shortcomings very specific to an environment that can be only diagnosed the this really annoying rattling sound that seems to be coming from nowhere whenever cruising at and drives you absolutely yet none of the mechanics is nor willing to get down to the cause when the car is at the software application set of your own product goes far beyond the software it unavoidably encompasses the entire your dog lets to develop and better understand the techniques of using the software within a it is fair to say that some software is used within a number of widely different formal testing might not be able to cover each of these contexts in simply because it might be difficult to define formally what specific tests you need to do once something has or it might be too expensive to mimic these contexts inhouse or go through all the known tests cases every time the software has slightly change testing is really good at checking that changes done to the software do but the other important area of evolution where formal testing is struggling is when you need to detect the changes in the software environment or usage patterns that come from the external using your own product will help detecting these changes much probably before told by the users on the quality of the user feedback is wrong with such there is no balance to strike between using your own product and formally testing it both as much as it is returns getting are worth the one is to compliment not to serve as a should do the is unless there is no dedicated resource to do the formal testing developers doing all the and you have to select how much time you can dedicate to any of the two important distinction here is that formal testing is best done by an independent people who report to the development and design on the other hand everyone marketers and even in should be using company products or services as much as because the core idea behind is to give everyone involved the experience of service or product they contribute to in a real life dogfood or can far as dogfood certain types of argument let not concentrate on how dogfooding eating your but rather think instead of what it getting a experience and with these of the actual next best thing to eating the food yourself is observing the dog whilst it eats the as opposed to relying on someone else telling you what your likes or the dev team members may not be able to personally put sewage control software to use in their everyday jobs nothing stops them from spending some time regularly observing a sewage engineer using the which follow the letter of but certainly captures it
