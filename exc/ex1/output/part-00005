 1 the in the prototype applies to the that dict int as function with a argument of type pointer to constant dict which means you can change the but not you want to get the effect you probably declare it like const int rule the applies to the word that is to the left of except when it is first in the type and then it applies to the next changing change the pointer in the main since the pointer is passed by assigning to the the compiler checks that the types are in this means that you can only add not remove as you should you use the you should use const on all you as you probably want to change the dictionary the i use any since the data are to be changed a good signature for it would int you would be able to change the calling pointer to delete the first

 3 mvc layers are really only applicable from the standpoint of the user interface so the two additional layers that you note are really part of the a ddd driven you would have your controllers call out to an application service that would handle checking with the security layer if the action is authorized and then either executing the action against your business layer core domain model or returning back an type message back to the instead of using the application service you can just have the controller call directly to the business logic layer which does the security checking internally out to the security but depending on how complex your business logic it may be less clear to have it intermixed with your authorization checks to the security

 a big because it leads to unmanageable component and most likely some form of build errors and very likely some deployment at some point in the project life studio 2008 explicitly prevents circular references between projects in as you have that is not the case for i believe that is because vs2008 expects that binary references are managed independently and it expects that you are building those projects generally that means all binary references should be viewed as components that represent a distinct relationship your code and the msbuild allows you to use the sln file to build if all your projects use vb or this allows for the creation of an which is ideal for an automated build the catch is that in order for such a master solution file to all of the projects in the sln must utilize project in order to take advantage of by microsoft expects that you are not employing circular since they are explicitly forbidden by the visual studio ide project hanselman makes reference to an file in the following parallel msbuilds from within the visual studio

 a bit but for debugging you can turn on the this will allow you to set up your own error the easiest way to set up said error handling would be to override this will terminate your but it will there may be things you can do to make this not kill your but this will depend on what platform deploying this at any never use this in pretty much going to have to have extensive error handling in one technique used is something like def def print your own error return def raise you use as a decorator on your it will automatically handle whatever errors happened within function is called for some exceptions in but is not getting called for other errors like importerrors import thisclassdoesnotexist in new to is this because of some distinction between and all errors are the reason why this is causing problems is because these errors occur immediately when the module is imported before your view is ever the first method i posted will catch errors like these for you might be able to figure something out for but argue that you have worse problems if getting importerrors in a production app not doing any dynamic tool like can help you eliminate these kinds of problems

 a code coverage tells you what you definitely not what you of building a valuable unit test suite is finding the most code and asking hard questions of you want to make sure the tough stuff works as a coverage figures have no notion of the of nor the quality of my many of the most important tests you will ever write are the tests that barely add any coverage at all cases that add a few extra here and but find loads of problem with setting hard and coverage targets is that developers may have to start bending over backwards to test their making code and then just if you hit coverage with great tests then but in most situations the extra effort is just not worth people start with numbers rather than focussing on the quality of the seen badly written tests that have just as seen excellent tests that only have i tend to look at coverage as an indicator of what definitely been

 a is not a the reverse is you could cast a myobjectcollection to a list because myobjectcollection inherits from and for all intents and is a only thing you can do is to define a constructor on myobjectcollection that takes an ienumerable as a parameter and initalizes itself with the data in the other but that will make a new object containing the same class myobjectcollection public noted in the you could have the cast succeed at provided that dosomething actually returns an instance of if it the object effectively is a and the cast is completely have to it is bad practice in my view to upcast something like if the function returns a you should not rely on a specific implementation of either modify the return type of if you own that and return a or deal with it as a

 a personal been developing a kernel in things are going in fact i have very good support for much of available in kernel land implemented nearly the entire libc and of the more difficult and compiler specific things is rtti and exception for now disabling exceptions but rtti is something i want since things like can be very to make this i have a basic implementation of which matches what expects and then i link to and this works rtti works like a been toying with some optimization options and would like to someday have as a compile time obviously this being a kernel and having to interact with assembly there are certain functions which play nice with not having the parameters on the to solve i use the following asmlinkage this works very the problem is that when you do a the compile emits calls to some implicitly defined internal functions in the support libraries previously and does so respecting the of course since i linked to the support they may or may not in my have a compatible calling to a nice pretty kernel since these functions are implicit prototype in any of my and they have mangled it is impossible to add my asmlinkage attribute to are 3 possible solutions which come to about all those 2 support libs same flags as the be annoying and know if be cleanly isolated from the and toolchain upgrades very but should make the compiler when calling code found in a particular option 3 my gut feeling is but i figured that i would ask since there are a few gurus on here do i make ignore for certain

 a pointer again instead of a usually uses pointer arithmetic when they want to get a pointer to get a pointer while using an array you are calculating the pointer then getting the value at that memory then you have to use to get the address more typing and less clean say you need a pointer to the 512th byte in a buffer cleaner more efficient is cleaner pointer arithmetic as an pointers with and decrementing with is useful when iterating over each element in an array of it is cleaner than using a separate variable used to keep track of the can use pointer subtraction with pointer this can be useful in some cases to get the element before the one you are pointing it can be done with array subscripts but it looks really bad and especially to a python programmer where a negative subscript is given to index something from the end of the	
 a pointer to a function is very useful in a variety of it allows you to refer to functions as which lets you at which function you will use for this is in say i want some background process to work for a and let us know when done we can update the or but we may want this background process to call one and we want it to call a different rather than writing two versions of this background we can write it so that the background process receives a pointer to the function we want it to when the process is it calls whichever function it was given in the first it just lets you have a heap more flexibility in deciding which method to in that quite similar to in behind the i believe uses pointers to functions to facilitate polymorphism storing a different table of pointers to functions for each

 a pretty cool but i know enough about your requirements to know if it will work for you or i am thinking first of all if i were using a chat i would like to simply click on a message and have it be copied into the after i think of anything else need to click on a message it would be great if hovering over a message caused it to be and clicking caused it to be that works for your then the question is how to achieve i am thinking that you could use a label to show the username who sent the and a readonly textbox to show the message every time a new message is added to the you insert a new label and a new textbox adding these controls to the controls collection of the probably should wrap the label and textbox in a so you can highlight the entire div when they how do you make clicking cause the text of the message to be copied to the it will take some if using a javascript see what it if here are some the javascript code would need to get only the contents of the which it can do by looking for the right css class or the right and copy that text to the clipboard as described in these for copying to 2nd link about javascript for copying to 3rd link about javascript for copying to 4th link about javascript for copying to the maybe you have the requirement that users should be able to select the text of many in that perhaps clicking on a message and you can have multiples a button for all selected the only thing this handle is selecting part of the text of a so it may or may not be right for your

 abstraction i mean what should i call them and what kind of icon should i use to represent it in the the concept of tags should be familiar to most users right but not so sure hierarchical tags nor does the abstraction of tags completely i have is actually something between folders and in that each subtag is a proper subset of its to get the contents of a you take its contents plus the contents of its and do that in a way like where i just partially answered my own question in the process of asking what do you guys think of calling them what kind of icon would you give since a category is an abstract concept rather than a physical object that can take a wiki if for what looking for is an abstraction for an like aunt sally that easily grasp the ideally there is also a graphical representation that can be easily associated with that one thing i did forget to mention is that an item can exist in more than on category like how google doc allows you to add an document to multiple i guess kind sold myself on calling them it just fits everything you can do with something can belong to a more than one subcategories make most subcategories people normally create lend themselves to an relationship a windows user might have say a folder called resumes in their my documents because a resume is a it would make sense that in my documents as well if you think of the folders as i still figured out is the icon sure going to be using some kind of treeview to display them i could just use a folder icon i maybe a custom icon unless anyone else has a better google calls them so i guess it be too bad clarify my target audience will be people technical enough to know how to download and install the but about kind of abstraction should i use for hierarchical

 add a little to and your difference between a resource is that the garbage collector is aware of managed resources and aware of unmanaged i know that answer very concrete but the difference is help draw the line in the sand here is the short probably riddled with little version of how gc runs and cleans up garbage collector is aware of all managed objects but when garbage collection runs it initially know if any given object is still in use or is elegible to be it determines whether or not it can cleanup an object by initially marking all objects as then traversing from the application root to all referenced each object that has a relationship back to the root either direct or gets marked as reachable and is no longer considered after the gc runs through every reachable object it cleans up the rest since they are no longer in almost all cases working with framework objects you can be assured that objects are managed provides managed wrappers of nearly all unmanaged resources to ensure they are properly cleaned other third party components which hook into the win32 api your components which do are the objects which may be cause for are some objects which can be considered to be somewhat components of the graphics library are one memory really memory leaks in the true typically they occur when you you have removed an object from use but in fact the object still has some reference to the a common example is adding eventhandlers onsomeevent addhandler addressof and not removing are technically not memory leaks since your application is still technically using however if there are enough of them your application can suffer severe performance impacts and may show signs of resource issues unable to attain window an intermediate developer and unfortunately know about these problems i recommend playing with ants profiler to help become familiar with lingering references is a free trial or if you want to get a little bit more research using windbg and to look at the managed if you decide to look into the latter i recommend reading tess she has a lot of great tutorials and advice on using windbg

 addition to answer i totally like to suggest you consider defining the attribute map in this will make your program extremely flexible and will factor out a lot of code you even realize you an attribute can know what field it binds to on the what field it binds to in the a list of actions to execute when the attribute changes recalculate might apply to both strength and it this you have no code per attribute to write a class out to the db or display it on the you simply iterate over the attributes and use the information stored same thing can apply to attributes and skills would probably derive from the same base you go down this probably find yourself with a pretty serious text file to define attributes and but adding a new skill would be as easy 20 coordinates probably the best some adding a skill like this would require no code change it could all be done in data pretty and all the data is stored in a single skill object attached to a you of define actions the same weave you attempt to weave a basket from case weaving you have the case weaving you make a lame subtract 10 create basket value improve skill weaving case weaving you make a decent subtract 10 create basket value improve skill weaving case weaving you make an awesome subtract 10 create basket value improve skill weaving case weaving you made the basket of the subtract 10 create basket value this example is pretty you should be able to visualize how it would be done with absolutely no imagine how difficult it would be to do anything like that without code if your were actually member

 addition to what others have already there are also benefits specific to using cloud services by companies like what some might is not inherently in most quite the opposite this is because most companies do not have the resources to provide the level of reliability and redundancy that like microsoft or amazon unless you are hosting source code for a defense project or other projects where the threat of espionage is very the greatest threats to your code and your business are more mundane things like cloud services provide levels of redundancy that most businesses simply cannot obtain on their this includes data redundancy hardware redundancy and geographical redundancy server locations across the if a natural disaster hits your is your data going to be each small business by itself cannot afford support staff and dollar but pooling their resources together through a cloud service affords them centralization and better resource access to a much higher level of related to by centralizing the data of thousands of this allows security resources to be much more tightly it should be noted that most commercial hosting providers offer and dedicated and even cloud service providers allow customers to configure their however they and whatever applications on it they so you can have a great deal more freedom than that offered by web

 addressing the specific problem you asked but this is likely to come up what point is this video displayed in the page or downloaded by the what does the generated html that the browser uses to get the video look the browser has to call that video somewhere using a separate http and you might do better by creating a separate http handler to handle that and just writing the url for that handler in your for storage or view elsewhere you should consider just saving the information needed to create the video at this point and deferring the actual work until the video is finally

 advantage of growing down is in older systems the stack was typically at the top of programs typically filled memory starting from the bottom thus this sort of memory management minimized the need to measure and place the bottom of the stack somewhere	
 advantage of oracle is the tuning in oracle you can pretty much change i know if you get that level of customization in sql the tools side sql server its very easy to work with limitations but still very well it if using then sql server though you can use oracle with it if using java then oracle can also connect to sql server using you ask me which one to say since you get pretty much the same quality and advanced technology with free database servers like mysql or postgresql since i use and they integrate pretty one should you i try it take you more than a day to install and play with them both have advantages and both are reach the point that it matter which dbms you pick 4 big mssql or	
 advantage of storing data in the db is taking advantage of db security mechanisms and reducing maintanence cost the disadvantage of it is increasing db load and consuming connections might be expensive for licensed database if you are using sql server might be a nice the for web apps any other apps that might need streaming the usually more sensible to store data outside	
 advantage of using generics is that it increases the type safety you can only put in the correct type of and you get out the correct type without requiring a the only reason i can think of for not using generic collections is that you need to store some arbitrary am i missing what other reasons are there to not use generics when dealing with would you not use generic	
 advantages of an abstract class to specify default implementations of invariant checking to slightly more control in how the methods are to provide behavior related or unrelated to the interface for are merely data passing contracts and do not have these they are typically more flexible as a type can only be derived from one but can implement any number of	
 adventures in python continue and my favorite books are silent python offers a way to test if a variable is inside an iterable using the in print is definitely is it possible to test if more than one item is in the list using the syntax but it is kinda in stxt or in stxt or in stxt or print course regexes can but using regexes will take lots of verbose of code and be as clear as in are there any other pythonic in how about multiple

 agree it should be kept simple but most of the scrum framework can be used had several people working in this fashion both on projects as well as on still an owner thats in charge of defining the business value and the backlog should still be part of a bigger scrum enterprise then he probably needs to feed on part of a bigger product team its either a 1 or so its really but thats daily yes between the 2 or if its just that 1 person at good time to go over tasks and think about what impediments need to be surfaced to the scrum of scrum or to the product still a good especially if part of a larger scrum enterprise thats working in but even without good chance to catch up with demo what you energize retrospect and see what you can do plan for the next that in case of working outside of a scrum enterprise scrum of sprints can benefit from being shorter than usual since the scope is probably smaller and the planning overhead but it depends on the it can be held i think killer programmers need to retrospect on their own and take action on things that hold them even keep a chart in your workspace to help you with making board burndown you need you can have them in your work space on the they can be but they really help even if one can gtd things help a single person and a if that person is doing project work then a sprint burndown and release burndown provide a lot of if doing work its still a way to verify on track or and apply relevant measures master the person should be his own scrum if the organization had a coach helping the then he should also help this scrum sum up its clear to me that the values and principles underlying apply for person teams as also clear that most of scrum can be applied as questions is what the individuals involved the the the po are all on board and believe that the make and strive to it will they then first get to the point where the overall thinking makes then deal with the individual	
 agree that it could be more in for all of these are acceptable entry void void int int versions returning use the return value as the exit code for the if you care about receiving any you can use one of the versions which take any arguments given when the program is launched are it be more flexible but never struck me as a significant problem in	
 agree with answer except he claims it about improving the quality of the i think it absolutely to do with as well as the usability he mentions in his first you can have a wide you will realistic data than qa is likely to use that wider of data than qa is likely to by sheer force of certainly fixed bugs found in dogfooding plenty of where the situation just been tested by in many situations you really test all but dogfooding helps to test as many people to dogfood as you can set appropriate expectations about potential of it certainly be a thing building a of this take away from the valuable work of qa it adds to depends on what developing been in one company where the employees would never have any cause to use the product in everyday so dogfooding really in another company we were building a web so it made sense to get a large chunk of the company to browse through the recently been working on a synchronization product aimed at so again it makes sense to dogfood

 agree with devin and would add that dealing with special values may look good in small example cases but a few notable nan in fpus and null in it scale nearly as the only time it works is typically got lots of nested homogeneous processing math or care about distinguishing error care where the error operations are pure with no side can be given a reasonable meaning at the higher level rows	
 agree with however if your dealing with a string that i would break muliple lines to assist in you are litterally trying to create 257 then why not use the dupestring function in the strutils easier to and maintain if you are doing this in a loop and therefore are worried about then assign the function result to a local variable and use the slotsofas ix slotsofas for ix 0 to 1000000 slotsofas

 agree with the application you build with vs2008 is using dynamic whereas the dev is linking hence the larger size and why one works and not the if its a plain win32 application project got you to distribute it with a you be able to get it to run on another machine without redistributing the crt by getting vs2008 to link statically for you its just the standard lib i have a copy of vs2008 to so describe how to do it in vs2005 and hopefully translate up configuration properties for the project click the project then select from the then then click the for your particular configuration select the version of the library for debug builds you want debug and for release builds you want and see if that obviously get a much bigger final binary now the library is statically

 all your services are part of the same application there seem to be any reason why you share the cache directly via a shared object the simplest way of doing this is via a static you choose this one thing to be very careful about is thread if your cache is concurrently accessed via two wcf you must ensure that the two sessions are not going to interfere with each other by both changing the cache at the same if the cache is your need to do this is but you still might need to synchronrise initialisation of the

 already initialization lists get completely executed entering the constructor so it is completely safe to use members in the constructor have made a comment in the accepted answer about having to to the constructor but not the member inside the constructor you is possible that you mistook the fact that you refer to parameters and not to member attributes the initialization as an given a class x that has two members and of type the following constructor may be int a a possible problem here is that the construction of the elements in the initialization list depends on the order of declaration in the class and not the order in which you type the initialization if the class were defined int a int int regardless of how you type the initialization list the fact is that will be executed is initialized since the declaration of the members is first and later that will create a bug as your code believes probably on being twice the value of and in fact contains the simplest solution is not refering to the int a a correct regardless of how x is this pitfall is the reason why you are suggested not to use member attributes as part of the initialization of other

 am designing an and like to ask a few questions about how best to secure access to the the api is allowing access to artists have that have users of the api have access to a subset of all the if a user calls the api asking for some it is easy to check if the user is allowed to do if the user asks for an the api has to check if the album belongs to an artist that the user is allowed to accessing songs means that the api has to check the album and then the artist before access can be database i am looking at an increasing number of joins between tables for each additional layer that is i want to do all those and i also want to store the user id everywhere in order to limit the number of work around i came up with the following api gives the user a reference to an for instance an artist the user can then ask that artist object for the which returns a list the list object can be and album objects can be obtained from from an album object a songlist object can be obtained and from the individual song the api trusts the artist it also trusts any objects in this that the user gets from without further and so forth for all the other so i am delegating the to objects down the would like to ask you what you think of good or bad about and of how you would solve this how would you approach this if the api should be my approach seems less applicable in that do i secure data access in my new

 am developing a java web application that bases it behavior through large xml configuration files that are loaded from a web as these files are not actually required until a particular section of the application is they are loaded when one of these files are a query is sent to the webservice to retrieve the corresponding as some of the configuration files are likely to be used much more often than others like to setup some kind of caching maybe a 1 hour expiration to avoid requesting the same file over and files returned by the web service are the same for all users across all i do not use jsf or any other fancy just plain question what is considered a best practice to implement such a static cache within a java web is a singleton class or will there be weird behaviors due to the j2ee should i expose something somewhere through what shall i do so that my cache get screwed in clustered environments but not to have one cache per clustered the informations would it be a correct implementation to put an object responsible for caching as a servletcontext i do not want to load all of them at startup and be done with it because that would overload the webservice whenever my application starts the files might change while my application is so i would have to requery them i would still need a globally accessible so my question still using a caching proxy as may be a good but each request to the webservice will send rather large xml query in the post which may be different each only the web application really knows that two different calls to the webservice are actually for your web how to implement caching

 am developing a restful web have a bunch of entity classes jpa but also other are gazillions of object binding and whatnot libraries out looking for a one that will enable me the entities to xml and must support using not only object must support by views i mean a way to specify a subset of the properties of the which are to be for an see partial in the social platform i also want it to recurse indefinitely view should define properties to be exposed in the entity and a view for each of them entities the entity might have views and when requesting a view of a only properties and would be when requesting a the properties and are would also be but only with the view it recurse to json serialization must be what would make sense in that means i want proper booleans and nulls and i want extra object wrappers or something that tries to capture the entire xml it must be possible to configure the serialization to use for serializing not xml arrays must be serialized using nested elements so possible to differentiate between empty arrays and properties which present in a given property present in person has no xml and json and merge the data into existing this is the difficult the next two are of must be possible to but which properties are present is not defined in into existing not creating new is a bit tricky to most libraries deserialize into java but at that the distinction between an undefined property and a property it exists in xml as described is being given this being passed a the library touch the entities clear for course with lists this should be more i would expect to configure an id by which it would decide whether to update the nested entity or create a new are a reason why the library must not just return a because at that time a might either mean or been saying a i realize now the library actually provide but there must be a way to add the functionality in a clean fashion not in a way that would make rewriting everything bean serialization and

 am having to use triggers in mssql for the first well triggers in having read around and tested this myself i realise now that a trigger fires per command and not per row deleted or entire thing is some statistics for an advertising our main stat table is rather large and contain the data in a way that makes sense in most it contains one row per advert viewed and as a user one is more inclined to want to view this as day x has y amount of clicks and z amount of views and so we have done this purely based on a sql query so getting this sort of report from the main but as the table has grown so does the time for that query to because of this we have opted for using triggers to keep another table updated and hence making this a bit easier on the sql issue is now to get this working with multiple what i have done is to create 2 stored one for handling the operation of an and one for a my insert trigger to work with a single then graps the data off the inserted and sends it off to the stored the delete trigger works in the same and the update trigger does the same as a delete an issue is now how to best do this with multiple i have tried using a but as far as i have been able to read and see this performs really i have considered writing some as well as in checking to see if there are multiple records in the commands and then go with the and otherwise simply just avoid my solution with a and im wondering if a way of doing this trigger on after set nocount declare date declare declare declare declare declare declare declare declare declare declare insertcursor cursor for select id from declare open fetch next from insertcursor into while select from where id select from advert as inner join campaign as t2 on where advertid from inserted where id exec procstatinserttrigger fetch next from insertcursor into close deallocate stored procedure is rather big and intense and i do not think a way of having to avoid looping through the records of the inserted table in one way or another maybe there but like to be able to read the code too so not gonna bore you with that one you like to think so pretty is there a better way of doing and if well after the procedure procstatinserttrigger set nocount on added to prevent extra result sets interfering with select set nocount declare select 1 from cachedstats where and campaignid and customerid if is insert into cachedstats values select declare declare declare declare declare select advertisercost publisherearning from where and customerid and campaignid if 0 if click add one to the select if select select if update cachedstats clicks uniqueclicks uniqueclicks publisherearning advertisercost publishercpc advertisercpc where and customerid and campaignid else if 1 or 4 lead or update cachedstats leads leads publisherearning advertisercost advertisercpc publishercpc where and customerid and campaignid else if 3 update cachedstats leads leads publisherearning advertisercost advertisercpc publishercpc advertiserordervalue publisherordervalue where and customerid and campaignid else if 2 update cachedstats uniqueviews uniqueviews publisherearning advertisercost publishercpc advertisercpc where and customerid and campaignid my final posted in case others have a similiar trigger on after set nocount insert all missing insert cachedstats select inserted inner join advert as a on inner join campaign as c on and not exists select 1 from cachedstats as where and campaignid and customerid and update all affected records at update clicks clicks select from inserted where and and and and uniqueclicks uniqueclicks select from inserted where and and and and and select from inserted where and and and and uniqueviews uniqueviews select from inserted where and and and and and leads leads select from inserted where and and and and and in publisherearning select from inserted where and and and advertisercost select from inserted where and and and publisherordervalue publisherordervalue select from inserted where and and and and 3 advertiserordervalue advertiserordervalue select from inserted where and and and and publishercpc case when select from inserted where and and and and 0 select from inserted where and and and cost clicks select from inserted where and and and and clicks advertisercpc case when select from inserted where and and and and 0 select from inserted where and and and cost clicks select from inserted where and and and and clicks end inserted 1 set nocount looks slightly different now because i had to index it per advertisement too but thanks alot for the help sped everything up from to 30 sec to generate the cachedstats from my own development stat table multiple records in a ms sql

 am pretty new to mvc and i am trying to get my head around some of the design concepts at the one thing i am currently stuck on is how to handle a situation such as that described i have a page that needs to render a number of for on the left hand side there is a list that is data driven and then the selected item in the list displays a further list in another section on the for better understanding lets suggest the left hand list is a list of movie categories and the other list displays a list of movies that are contained within that along with the various movie i have some form of orm such as entity linq to sql or whatever that maps the tblcategory and tblmovie database tables into category and movie entities these entities live in the i then use a repository pattern located in the namespace to encapsulate the queries against these entities to return our model is where my first question should the repository be returning view model entities or domain entities which are then extended to produce view model in my naive mind i see the entities returned from the orm as simply containers for the data with domain entities containing the business so surely there should be an abstration back to my now lets assume i wish to present the two sections described at the beginning of i am assuming that what should be happening here is my domain entity model would contain a list of categories and their associated so something like a list each of which contains a model would have been populated this is my second say my assumption above is correct and it is simply data entities are returned from the now i have a called the with some domain entities such as the movie and category entities mentioned in the previous do these entities have methods on them to retrieve the data from the orm and populate or does the repository retrieve these populated entity and another question on this if i have a movie and customer entity in my orm is it acceptable to be having domain entities named the i assume the controller now has this populated list of category and movie objects and passes it back to the i am guessing it is best to have each of the sections described at the beginning as partial views and passing the populated model to it may be the indexcontroller which retrieves the populated categorymovies passing this to the categories partial view and the movies partial i would then need to somehow determine the selected category and display the appropriate list of movies in that category within the so if anyone has got to this point in my ramblings i will take a deep i hope i have explained my mixed up thoughts and questions in sufficient detail for someone to provide some kind of for partial models and

 am trying to understand how to implement a code coverage tool using the win32 debugging thinking has been to utilize the debugging to launch a process in debug mode and track what cpu instructions has been after having tracked all cpu instructions i would then use the map file to map it to what source code lines were far as i there would be two ways of knowing what cpu instructions have been be to launch the process in debug mode set all threads in single step mode and let the debugging app note all instructions that has been executed be make a more intelligent approach where you would know a lot more about x86 instructions and basically replace the next branch instruction with a then keeping track of the delta instructions between the two new suggested approaches inspired by with the map file and insert breakpoints for the beginning of each line and let the debug framework be notified every time a breakpoint with the map file binary instrumentation to insert a that get called at entry of each source line avoiding the callback through the debugger a vm technology such as vmware to find out what instructions in a particular process was executed i fully understand this someone validate one of the approaches above or maybe suggest an alternative please note that the use case is code coverage and not performance profiling thus we need to know if each single source line is primary goal no particular plan is in would be to create a simple code coverage tool for delphi to implement a code coverage tool using win32 debugging

 am working on a group senior project for my university and i have run into a major hurdle in trying to get my code to compiler that we have for our 8 bit atmel microcontroller does not support the new or delete and it does not support the i could program it in but i have to implement an algorithm which i have never done while i have tried c initially i soon realized that i never did pure c trying to model objects with structs and functions is slowing me down since i am so used to the much cleaner the exact wording for my compilers shortcomings can be found overcome them and still use i have considered the following allocate just use templates to generate fixed arrays on the allocate and find some hack to call the constructor for objects once i have allocated the space for placement new an option since new an just use c and suck it its a microcontroller why am i getting find a better compiler which will probably cost second option is the hardest but it would have the biggest pay off in terms of how i can write this i imagine that debugging it could be a huge pain if i get it thinking of creating objects on the copying their bits into the allocated and then zeroing the bits in the object so it call its to do that i would access the bits directly with an unsigned char pointer and the sizeof operator to get the byte sounds terrible and i know if it could work but i am considering i know vtables can be a problem but i intend on having any vtables since it is just an 8 bit can you do when your embedded compiler have operator new or stl

 amount of memory your process can address depends both on whether it is running on a bit machine and whether or not it it running as a cpu agnostic or cpu specific default a process is cpu agnostic so it will run with the process type that is natural to the version of in 64 bit it will be a 64 bit and in 32 bit it will be a 32 bit you can force a process though to target a particular cpu and say make it run as a 32 bit process on a 64 bit you exclude the large address aware the following are the various bit process can address bit process can address is a link to the full breakdown of addressable space based on the various options windows

 an arbitrary real either an integral type or a floating point type is only going to provide an the integral approximation will never be off by more than in one direction or the other that the real number fits within the range of that integral the floating point approximation will never be off by more than a small percentage assuming that the real is within the range of values supported by that floating point this means that for smaller floating point types will provide closer approximations storing an approximation to pi in a float is going to be much more accurate than the int approximation for very large the integral approximation will actually be better than the floating point consider the value which is only off by when represented as 9223372036854775807 as a but which is represented by when stored as a is just an artifact of how printing the values and cannot be exactly represented as floating point values the denominator a power of just as be exactly written as a decimal get where the repeat regardless of the language you the internal representation of this value is going to be the but different ways of printing the value may display it note that if you evaluate in the result is displayed as least on my type you use in scientific calculations will depend on exactly what trying to your answer is generally only going to be approximately how accurate do you need it to what are your performance i believe that the decimal type is actually a fixed point which may make it inappropriate for calculations involving very small or very large note also that includes arbitrary precision rational numbers the bignum which may also be appropriate depending on your

 an example that dates back to my own university days it was used both as a database design challenge and as an object oriented design all information was revealed at once part of the challenge was to see how to adapt a design to handle new and how proper normalisation made this you have to design a database for a situation and want to handle have the each course has a title and a regular timeslot each course has a who presents the course has many who study the course has one or more who help students with their you need to track which tutors help which courses have multiple regular courses have multiple and tutors are which means we need to track some information for tax the tax department care what they were paid for they expect us to have a single record per some the lecturer works as a tutor as to get a close up view of how some students are handling the tutors are also on other be a tutor on a you have to have been a student on that course at an earlier every student will receive credit for passing the course some are just auditing the course without a need for student who fails a course may attend the course again later we need to keep records of every	
 an excellent book that is not as widely but is full of deep software the cooperative by alistair so special about clearly everyone has heard the term and it seems most are believers these whether you believe or there are some deep principles behind why the agile movement this book uncovers and articulates these principles in a scientific some of the principles are these are my not hardest thing about team software development is getting brains to have the same we are building complex systems which are invisible in the tangible the better you are at getting more brains to share deeper the more effective your team will be at software is the underlying reason that pair programming makes most people dismiss it i did too but with this principle in mind i highly recommend that you give it another you wind up with two people who deeply understand the subsystem you just built there many other ways to get such a deep information transfer so it is like a vulcan mind always need words to communicate deep understanding and a too many and you exceed the meaning the understanding transfer attempting does not consider that children learn how to speak language by being and not just language either he gives the example of some kids playing with trains on the along comes another kid who has never even a train before but by watching the other he picks up the gist of the game and plays right this happens all the time between this along with the corollary about too many words helps you see how misguided it was in the old days to try to write 700 page detailed requirements is so much more in there shut up but i highly recommend this

 answer is about as good as but not likely to be too if someone wants to look at your images and they know anything about image open it in a hex editor and most likely recognize what they see as a jpeg with the magic header you really want to keep someone from viewing your construct your own image not as hard as it and put as little metadata in as and then hope that or encrypt or put them into an your own archive format for best and hope anything encoded has to be decoded before it can be and any hacker can trace their way through your decoding routine and figure out how it why are you trying to hide things from your users	
 answer is based around which is the normal programmatical way to look up it relies an a ptr record being set up for that this is often but not always set up to something example look and get but since there is no ptr record for return anything many server farms will just give you a generic hostname like yougetsignal is doing is dns they run some dns servers people are and remember every hostname that was looked then you can query their records of past lookups by the address that was put into yougetsignal and get a list of hostnames that previously resolved to the dailywtf server when people queried not anything to do with the reverse dns ptr

 answer probably depends how critical it is for you to receive support and possible customization for this can certainly do look into their xml and geocoding you should be able to craft an xml message asking google to return map coordinates for a given if the address is not found you will receive an appropriate a useful that aim in providing the maps api is to plot addresses on actual while you can certainly use the data for other you are at the mercy of google should one of their maps not exactly correspond to your legal or commercial address validation if you paid for one of the services you you would likely be able to receive support should certain addresses not resolve the way you expect them other you get what you pay for if you have the why not try implementing a solution then going from the api looks pretty and after

 answer to your question is both yes and if you look in the going by version in section see that a stream within a pdf document can be represented by an so you can go ahead and specify that a pdf its image content in the specified problem will be that when you specify an image within you are specifying a particular image that must have a particular data length and simply specifying dct compression and url is not images are contained in streams of a particular if the stream is too long or too it is considered an you can have images dynamically served provided that they are always exactly the same byte i and i say this because the specification is somewhat ambiguous as to what happens when you set the length to 0 in the stream is doing this maybe need a fairly strong pdf toolkit in order to be able to author these and if you have i think be better off authoring the entire pdf document that your clients want on the fly rather than trying to substitute an image at read

 answer your what software do i need to download and there are a number of subversion clients for including that integrates with visualstudio and one that is very popular with our which integrates with windows the server recommend going with a hosted solution if your corporate policies just put into google and compare the available if i recommend installing the windows binaries from the what do i need to install the software windows subversion is available for all major platforms from the above so if a windows windows 2003 is if you are you may have a bit of an easier time configuring it behind apache on subversion is and has instructions for configuration on all platforms should i have a dedicated server or is an existing file server i recommend hosting externally over hosting it any hosting provider worth using will provide the following securely from anywhere via https need to configure corporate firewalls to work from home or a client backups need to set up new backup procedures for that dedicated server or file server in your need to worry about the box melting down or having some other issue that your team will have to deal with setup rather than having to learn server side configuration your company requires hosting it and there is sufficient space carved out on the file i would say not a problem to use an existing if you have a dedicated server that will be better just from the perspective of not having to with other parts of the organization assuming a shared how quickly will developers get up to is the integration similar enough to just carry on as there is a slight learning curve for but chapter 2 of the bean as well as the documentation for the clients explains how a regular work cycle if your developers are familiar with cvs be up to speed in no if they it may take a little while to get used to the notion that you have to lock files to work on them has a locking mechanism but not designed to be part of the standard work feel free to contact me directly if you have any other

 application often connects to different king of over web proprietary over and other kids of we already have a number of implementations that let us connect from our application to these and while all of these implementations implement the common java they do not share anything have realized that there are signification portions of code that are common for all of these particular connector implementations and we have decided to streamline the development of future connectors through one universal this connector will be capable of formatting messages to a format expected by and sending them using the available transport for message format over mq or over of the dilemmas we are facing is the most appropriate technology for this kind of so our connectors were basic java classes that implement the common java since we generally host our applications in some java ee application it seems that java connector architecture would be the most appropriate technology for this piece of implementing jca compliant connector seems to be relatively what are the palpable benefits of going with the standard jca and do benefits justify additional are the benefits of	
 application such as this would require a fairly complex data model to account for the different kinds of schools would have different a university might let you add or drop but an elementary school typically does a university needs to schedule courses into whereas an elementary school needs to put students into grades and split grades into classrooms based on available space and design needs to take into consideration all of the requirements it is expected to solve and then implement the more generic you make the program the harder it is to satisfy your the question says the code if you want to write a single program that solves every it will need hundreds of in some cases some schools will require an opposite feature from another for example some schools will need to enforce one teacher per subject or classroom while another school might require multiple the more requirements you expect to the more complex the application industry big applications tend to be written so that they can be a core set of functionality is provided but the application is meant to be changed and customized for a particular this makes it easier to develop because you need to anticipate every in fact you need to anticipate many needs until you have a customer with those but with you are not writing code only most important step is to come up with a data model that is flexible enough to extend later but so flexible that it is impossible to develop the hardest part is usually getting the cardinality of relationships for you might say a class has one then when it turns out a class needs two you have to rewrite a lot of code and fix up a lot of these kinds of changes are annoying and in the end you can always fix mistakes given enough programmer

 are a number of things that most frameworks although the definition is a basic bootstrapper setup check for compatability issues between php routing how to define rules for which urls point to which orm manipulate objects instead of writing sql queries usually involves creating a for template logic to avoid having php code in the template most frameworks also include a slew of libraries from simple to advanced web service would recommend two frameworks to look recommend this because a framework that works out of the it also has a great lots of 3rd party ci has a bit of trickery to get the framework to play nice with both php4 and which is also good to know for some a lot of people still use you should also take a look at which is a branch of codeigniter that has been rewritten as a strict php5 is a instead of dropping everything in a directory and churning out you pick the parts you need and glue them together since zend is made by the folks behind the engine behind php it uses latest and of php5 everything is and it uses type very clean if a bit think the essential stuff is the bootstrapper for the as well as how each framework implements a system to support libraries and the rest you can find as applications

 are talking about two separate but intertwined things coding you have several look at each one easily scans an existing tree to find its dependencies and create a configure script that will run under almost any kind of the configure script allows the user to control the build behavior as well as doing checks to ensure that the system can compile the generates a file a which programs can include to work around portability for if is not use forks personally use autoconf on many it usually takes people some time to get used to it does save can have makefiles inherit some of the values that configure finds without using providing a short template that describes what programs will be built and what objects need to be linked to build makefiles that adhere to gnu coding standards can automatically be this includes dependency handling and all of the required gnu people find this i prefer to write my own is a very cool tool for simplifying the building and installation of shared libraries on any sometimes i use other times when just building static link i do it by are other options see stackoverflow question to autoconf and you really should use kind of portable build configuration system if you release your code to the what you use is up to gnu software is known to build and run on almost you might not need to adhere to such sometimes extremely recommend giving autoconf a try if writing software for posix if you need documentation and update your fear m4 there is always the macro plenty of or drop in write your own or use autoconf is far too often confused with they are two separate

 are three advantages of splitting time between projects that cannot be doing or consulting on work that requires similar specialised knowledge in both and knowledge bringing consistency into the way two separate products are built and spreading knowledge accross the team on a rare occasion when one of the projects is temporarily on hold waiting for some further time between several projects is beneficial when it does not involve a significant change in a developer to work on multiple software development projects negates the benefit of specialisation any in the consistency and knowledge leaves just the advantage of time however if contexts differ significantly and there is no considerable overlap between projects the overhead of switching will very likely exceed any time switching is a very interesting contrary to its name implying a discreet change the process is always there are various degrees of having context information in context it takes less time to as opposed to however there is a direct correlation between the amount of context loaded on the and output possible to fill your time entirely working on multiple distinct projects relying on reduce the lead but the output quality will inevitably at some point not only aspects of quality that will but also functional failing to accomplish its functional

 are two separate problems do you maintain local forks of remote do you keep a copy of remote projects in your own 1 is pretty easy by just do something clone remote add upstream remote rm remote add origin push can then work on your forked repository when you want to merge in upstream pull upstream for problem one option is to use for cd into your main and submodule add i use git what do i need to may find git submodules to be a little bit tricky at here are some things to keep in commit the submodule before committing the push the submodule before pushing the sure that the head points to a branch before committing to a bash i recommend using to put the current branch name in your run submodule after switching branches or pulling can work around to a certain extent by using an alias created by one of my config pull git submodule update then git submodules are so what are the can check out the main project without checking out the this is useful when the submodules are and you need them on certain you have experienced git possible to have multiple forks of your and link them with different forks of your main somebody might actually fix git submodules to work more the deepest parts of the submodule implementation are actually quite just the tools that are submodules for what you want to use git you might want to look into subtree this keeps everything in one if the upstream repository uses is pretty easy if you know how to use git svn clone remote add origin push set up a local tracking branch in push origin checkout to merge from svn merge tested this but how we maintain one submodule with an upstream svn use git svn because it will make it very difficult to use git submodule in the parent project without losing just treat the subversion branches as mirrors of and merge from them you need to access the upstream subversion repository on another svn init svn should then be able to merge changes from upstream as

 are undoubtedly better than just firing up phpmyadmin and changing the schema i did during my php but after using them for i think fatally control is a solved the main function of migrations is to keep a history of changes to your but storing a different file for each change is a clumsy way to track you create a new version of a file representing the when you want to add a new attribute why should you create a new migration when you want to add a new another just as you check into version why not check into version control and make the changes to the file is functionally the same as keeping a file for each but much easier to work my mental model is want table x to have such and such columns i want model x to have such and such why should you have to infer from this how to get there from the existing just open up and give table x the right even the idea that classes wrap tables is an implementation why i just open up and class you went with a model like have to make a decision about what to do with existing but even migrations are overkill when you migrate going to lose fidelity when you use a my question if you think of a better migrations kind of use database migrations instead of a version controlled

 aspect oriented programming to check for if these fail throw an an action is actually check if the necessary privileges are if not cancel the an action has some optional task that need special check the necessary privileges before executing the optional task and react as your business rules if you forget to do the your aop code will do the check and throw an which is because it really should never come to as to the question posed in the comments on how to communicate the reason why an action is not use if the set of possible reasons is a fixed set at compiletime use a if not just create a little that can contain all the relevant

 assigning a default to a field false to a fxcop initializes field of type to remove this initialization because it will be done automatically by the i know that code as a or ok is introducing some but to me it seems a very good one that my teachers insisted on righteously in my only is the performance penalty very more relying on the default is relying on the knowledge of each programmer ever to use a piece of on every datatype that comes with a i think this is very the very program that should protect you from making all too obvious is suggesting here to make only for some increased talking about only executed programmers who care that can of course omit the initialization should probably use c or assembler fxcop making an obvious mistake or is there more to updates is not just my but what i have been taught at not that i like to use ad just to show that it just and concerning i just found this i initialize object fields to default does fxcop think initializing fields to the default value is

 attempt to remove object from itself it is a bad and in as3 you do it for be deleted garbage only if there are no references left to that since references always get passed by value and object is generally not aware of which references to it you delete object from the only useful thing you can do is to create a method which will clean up all resources used by an such method will serve as a but have to call it forget that event listeners will also prevent garbage collection unless you remove is also a difference between a property and setting it to effectively will remove a property from an instance of dynamic whereas setting property value to will not remove the but erase any reference that was stored therefore both actions will destroy the reference that was stored in some that you an only a are certain hacks that can be used to initiate garbage collection in flash players 9 and older however recently call got which does the same that you really rely on the fact that gc will actually be this is up to the flash to your throwing event and notifying parent that something went wrong is actually a good you should stick to it is better if parent will know of such event that and not when it will discover that some properties got magically reading grant skinner on in flash player is actually a good

 back some xml for presumably to update the model or the strength of wicket is that you have to worry about the rendered in you set up the controller to correctly modify the and wicket takes care of the separation is not in fact you can view or change and that can be seen as altering the what you generally have to do is directly manage the browser or wicket takes care of if you take care of making your changes in the java the ajax will call a method on your ajaxbehavior with an ajaxrequesttarget that method in methods called from you do whatever you need to updating models or and then you add to the target any view component that that has wicket takes care of updating the an taken from some code i but just to make explication the idea is dropdown where the options in the child change when the select option in the parent as in the series of the actual the model change is passed to the which decides for itself if it has and adds itself to the target if it then passes the target to its removed most of that to make a clearer the which just adds to itself an anonymous subclass of an elided for ajax work without new public void ajaxrequesttarget tell child to update its based on newly selected when the ajax is my owning is already note we could just type making explicit that calling on the enclosing class a inner class has a hidden ref now add the child to the wicket javascript will receive the new options and the child could also have hidden or or added behaviors like css or even swapped one panel for as long as for each changed component called so that the javascript can find added it to the that different types of ajax behavior have different callback so be sure overriding the right one an annotation so the compiler can complain if you got the name the basic wicket idea is that instead of sending raw data for the client to parse and act you update your model and and tell wicket to what by adding the chnaged components to the only reason i can think of to send straight xml would to be to feed it to let me know if your and i completely missed the

 been designing and developing software for windows mobile and windows ce in and for quite a few years i been doing so for honeywell hand held purchased by honeywell in where worked on nearly all aspects of the from drivers and services to line of business guis and of i tell you one language is better than the i probably spend a split of my time with and each platform definitely has their own place in the mobile will give a suggestion that you likely stay away from any device that runs an os as old as wince especially if you are even considering the reasoning for this is that only at cf embedded in rom of the os rom meaning that you would require a cab file to install at least cf you could develop with cf not worth the pain of using such an old most wince devices these days come with cf installed in the rom so i would at least look for that same you may even want to consider using a device with windows mobile or as they are easy to program with and will always have cf in case wondering why i have not mentioned cf or cf just because the first mobile platform to be release with those versions will be windows mobile which is not out though you can always install the framework if you want wince definitely gives you a more look and feel to its gui over its windows mobile so that is all a matter of your programming preference and what your end users want and comments on sdks being only a thing this is just not if you have a proper sdk you should have all of the same access to any devices or drivers that you would in but with the ease of for honeywell provides an extensive sdk for all of our devices in vb and and the portion of the sdk actually has functionality than the you will have to do a with our code from you want to take a look at the sdk talking freely available to download and has some great i would actually consider the provided sdk as more important than the hardware in many cases most of the the hardware for the devices is pretty much the they all have arm laser or image based i looked at the intermec link you posted and it look like that unit actually has a built in you using an external scanner hooked to the a look at the honeywell offering if you want got devices with probably the best imager based bar code scanner in the built into all of our and we have a rock solid sdk should i wrote a lot of and the sdk provides extremely access to all of the hardware on the stop my sales pitch for one language over the really all depends on what exactly you want to and services be written in anything but native c or so is out for anything like and can absolutely be your friend on mobile devices in terms of keeping things since you need the whole framework to run the

 been going through head first design patterns came in and i was reading about the strategy and it occurred to me that it might be a great way to implement a common way of calculating taxes on all of the particular objects i use at but i had a question about what i was interface decimal provincialtaxrate canadian decimal public decimal provincialtaxrate public provincialtaxrate new public decimal return provincialtaxrate subtotal federaltaxrate public decimal provincialtaxrate public provincialtaxrate new public decimal return provincialtaxrate subtotal federaltaxrate may have noticed that there is no declaration of federaltaxrate and what i wanted to where should that it in to the constructor for each concrete itax seems redundant and would allow for incorrect behaviour tax calculators must share the exact same federal tax creating a member of itax would allow them to be inconsistent as all tax calculators inherit from some other class where defined statically as well as class public static decimal federaltaxrate new with strategy

 been on a team that uses the fj and i know of on one team it was used as a replacement for a library that was less on another it replaced google i also know some folks that copycat the source code from fj to roll their own my if you must use you should be using something like functional java to make your life it increase code quality or written in a functional style is more hence more the library comes and encourages the use immutable data which improves the library also encourages composition over which improves the reusability of your developers with more powerful tools are more in my experience developers feel that functions make programming easier and more happy programmers are productive potential points of more functional style of programming discourages mutable which eliminates a large class of more powerful abstractions lead to less which reduces the number of places where something is no reason to believe that performance would be impacted one way or the the provided datastructures are designed for ease of use and expressiveness rather than but written optimally for what they as with anything how you drive is more important than what for is a linked so it has random access and therefore you avoid it for those has by

 been reading through misko writing testable definitely buy into dependency injection as a great tool to improve and use it a lot in my when reading the first part of the guide constructor does real i find still a bit fuzzy on how supposed wire up event say i have a in order to work needs to attach a listener to one of the arguments passed in via constructor dependency according to the the constructor should only assign arguments to member and do no other in the object should be fully initialized when the constructor in this i consider the object to be fully initialized unless required listeners are hooked far as i can this requires hooking up all the listeners in the builder or though this seems very decoupled from the object and easy to get out of in addition least in which spending most of my time in these this would mean that my event listeners could no longer be since the would need to see the best way to handle is there another option missing is responsible for attaching listeners in a dependency injection

 been working on an app that handles this exact behavior for the last 2 months or it has a small subset of functions which are online only and a large set of functionality that is using sqlite for local storage as suggested here with a modified version of the sqlitepersistentobjects the base version of sqlitepersistentobjects is not thread safe so watch out if you are using out objectiverecord for a thread safe alternative but be prepared to dig into the if you are willing to develop for the sdk then core data is another possibility for a sqlite overall architecture is simple enough i have modeled local storage using sqlite and remote interaction using against a rails app and rest it can use either xml or json for data an object is modified locally the change is first saved to the sqlite database record for that object and then added to a queue which is serialized and stored in the local sqlite db as queue can then be processed at any there is a connection available any queued local changes are deserialized and added to an nsoperationqueue which then processes them in the order to make this all work subclassed nsoperation so that it can support several types of remote queue operations delete essentially using objective resource to make the remote nice thing about using nsoperationqueue and nsoperation is that they handle the background threading for you so highly recommend having a look at the apple docs for those classes and also at the apple the application loads there is a bit of remote checking done and processed in the background to pull down the latest data although to be honest i am still changing the way this behaves a a quick overview of what had to deal with so it helps a	
 been working on my project about bank account transactions check and balance using ta said that i have to use temporary this temporary file will read line by line to find what the user is looking i did not understand this temporary open file at does anyone explain what that and if would you attach example of are the project project is about writing a program to perform transactions on bank you will be given a file which contains all the accounts in the bank file is named your program is to provide an interactive menu for users to perform transactions on these your program needs to update the account file after each the user may perform transactions on accounts that are not your program needs print an error message on the screen and return to the in your program needs to print whether a transaction is for unsuccessful your program will print out the reason for the failed program needs to be able to handle the following money into an money from an cashed against an inquiry of an is a limit on how many checks can be cashed against a saving the limit is 2 checks per there is a penalty for each check cashed over the if there is enough fund to cash the check but not the the transaction should go through and the resulting balance would be is the format in the account file for one account fields are separated by exactly one s for c for checking number of 5 name of account holder name of account holder of the account in the form integer field indicating how many checks have been cahsed this month interest rate in the form of names with fewer than 15 the data will be padded to have width of 15 is an example of the account 12345 smith john 10 45834 doe jane 0 58978 bond jones 5 temporary is a way in fortran to create a temporary status is no need to provide by using a temporary you can copy the accounts from the account file to the temporary then when you copy the data back from the temporary file to the account perform the necessary your program should not copy accounts between these two files if a transaction is to be forgive my 90 open

 believe asking not safe at the very this will depend on whether the compiler produces code that will atomically set the shared memory location when you set the i know but i suspect that a shmid is 16 to 64 that means at least possible that all platforms would have some instruction that could write this value but you depend on the compiler doing this without being asked of memory implementation are among the most things there it may not matter in your but in you have to worry about even on a single cpu in some device could write to the shared

 believe it is the call to if invalidate is not needed assuming that this button is a when you change the state of any the control is responsible for invalidating so when you changed the backcolor property of the it should have invalidated itself which would trigger the you sure that the backcolor property is supported for the control that btnattachments is assuming it is a regular but it might not for more also occurs to me that because this is a that you actually have the reference to the proper control that is being used to render the the datagridview has a concept of templates for controls for a and then the actual instance which it need to show how you are getting the button for that particular

 believe that your algorithm essentially makes your cache memory what you are seeing is the effect of of reference between the three essentially because each thread is operating on a different section of data that is widely separated from the others you are causing cache misses as the data section for one thread replaces that for another thread in your if your program was constructed so that the threads operated on sections of data that were smaller that they could all be kept in or closer together that all threads could use the same see a performance as it is i suspect that your slow down is because a lot of memory references are having to be satisifed from main memory instead of from your

 believe you can necessarily do this given that writing to the output stream may result in the data being flushed to the client prior to any servlet filters being invoked as a different architecture would be to generate your xml and then regenerate in whatever output format you having read your response to if you interfere with the current perhaps you require a servlet to proxy your capture the output from the original and then munge as very however

 best advice i can give is to build to the lowest common it as a project geared towards education facilities	
 best answer is that it depends on the specifics of your your skillset in cf and in stronger in design and what is the code expected to do you expect to do things that are easier to do in are you reusing business logic from elsewhere already written in i set out with the intention of breaking the code for the app in to two introduce complexity until	
 best bet is probably to decouple the behaviors from the technology used to implement way to do this is a dsl specific come up with a format that can represent the business logic in the abstract a micro store strings of that in your and implement an interpreter for it in that if your underlying technology changes you just have to reimplement the worked on an application that used this technique in the mid and been ported several times with only minor changes to the business rules	
 best bet is to create a property if you in the base class and provides a sort of base something virtual string get return property could stay the or change to something like and you could combine and to form a complete the this probably the best way to go about what is the purpose of naming these it looks to me like using a command pattern in image manipulation and either setting up a chain of actions to or want to keep a chain of actions to such a system would be better suited to a linked list which you could display in some sort of showing the action the name of the or the as defined and the series in which they would be far as your need to use the name to instantiate the not quite sure if this is truly your only two options would be a factory pattern or using reflection on either the name of the class or a custom attribute value could also be used for providing the if if going to be instantiating them the away from guess this is a roundabout way of saying it all depends on how this needs to have to provide more concrete and comprehensive information for a correspondingly concrete and comprehensive

 best way for you to learn c is to put in practice the topics you are example if you are going through basic principles like looping and if you can build yourself a little program that simulates the functionality of counting changes on a vending you move on to more advanced topics like pointers and data structures you can build a logo like the user can input each step of the and you can store that in a linked afterwards you can perform pointer operations on your data structure by or adding the idea is to start coding to test what you you will find that some of the time you really understand even though it seemed clear in the as a good programmer you will end up having to revisit the topics until you actually know

 better to err on the side of being positive when it comes to talking about another team this is especially so if within the we all like to have our work complemented from time to let the perfect be the enemy of the programming is tough so try to ignore as much as you possibly nobody loves having their work trashed so when it comes to suggestions or pointing out mistakes less is if algorithmically sound then more often than note let almost everything else slide the goal developers that much care about improvement have something to contribute to the in mind that developers come in all some with formal training to some totally most somewhere in just because someone study cs that mean not a great feeling of working on a team and seeing its including improve over smokes this got if i manage to stick to 3 or 4 of these on any given day a good day

 biggest challenge with a lot of the billing systems is that you either end up with a lot of coding to do or they come up short with one or more critical systems such as paypal handle externally driven recurring billing for security you as a customer can agree to a subscription from a but paypal has to handle everyone having to have a paypal or googlecheckout account to conduct business may be a depending on your the traditional merchant systems like authorizenet and linkpoint give you more but you might have a lot of coding to do to push the transactions through the way you depending on your not to mention more overhead in setting up the account in the first flexible payments stands somewhere in the offering more flexibility than but still having the third party account since doing a tool that manages relationships to their you may benefit from ability to facilitate transactions between two external done development in this space using java or ruby on ruby on rails has a wonderful gem built by the people at shopify called that makes credit card processing pretty simple once you have opened your merchant account with one of the type of most of the merchant providers have decent java apis as you may want to look at something like for since it lets you put together pretty invoices and has an cloud a big fan and it lets you manage the costs of scaling more it does require in many cases that you solve problems of clustering and failover more for tasks such as batch billing that can be run through something like amazon this an you bring up what you throw it in the black and get the result for something that requires continuous such as the web you will want to evaluate whether be cheaper to run a cluster of webapp servers in the cloud or just run 1 or 2 boxes at a managed data center such as the planet or the right answer for you depends in part on the expertise you have available and the for the continuous uptime you may also want to look at a provider such as that will host a rails app in the reply if anything i said requires further

 blog post great programming industry sort of answers short the first microcomputers run and the number of programmers was growing faster than the new ones could be educated by the old the programming culture basically started over in the early 1980s on and then the microcomputer programmers had to spend the next 30 years going through the growing pains that the programmers had already gone post rescued from wayback machine and posted great programming industry january while back i bought a copy of structured programming available as a free pdf from the primarily so that i could read essay on structured expanded version of in addition to on structured it contains an essay by hoare on and one by hoare and dahl on program was this last program which ended up having the greatest impact on it describes a programming language called simula simula 67 is an extended version of algol which contains some extra simulation it has these things called which each describe the behavior of a bunch of individual it has this thing which allows one class to include all of the attributes and behaviors of another also this function and statically typed and garbage similarity to java was so striking that i was depressed for i started looking a little bit forward and backwards from java and simula and i found some interesting similarities between a progression of languages that happened since the microcomputer revolution and a progression that happened before the microcomputer trying to interpret history a good portion of which i did not live so i realize that i am entering dangerous i encourage those of you who lived through this history to confirm deny any parts of my speculation that you am more familiar with the more recent so start 4k basic for the altair you can try out on peter simh based altair began a period of popularity for followed by one for pascal and and ignoring garbage collection in the rough order in which features were added level control structures while with and and recursive noticed that i can construct a very similar progression going from fortran to algol 60 to simula with the exception that the object oriented features come more or less at the same time as garbage i realize that i am picking and choosing my comparison points making me vulnerable to the texas sharpshooter also using a progression of popular languages for the languages and a progression languages that each sort of inspired the next for the but i have often felt like history is repeating and this particular pair of sequences worked as a lense to focus my have a hypothesis that many parts of the programming industry essentially rebooted with the microcomputer and two possible reasons that may have contributed to this reason alan kay has argued that when people join a community faster than they can be a new pop culture develops where things which used to be common knowledge among the community become relatively little is it possible that the microcomputer revolution caused the number of programmers to grow so quickly that the overall more ignorant programmer communities of the early 1980s needed to repeat the evolution that their predecessors from the mainframe and minicomputer eras went reason the early microcomputers just have the horsepower to run the more sophisticated programming systems that had been developed on mainframes and trying to run a smalltalk or lisp system in or or 64k on a 1mhz processor just particularly by the mid 1980s the microcomputers were powerful enough to do some of the fancier but by maybe the new programmers had spent enough time in their impoverished environments that they were only able to be drug into higher level programming languages a little bit at a my speculations are then it is kind of depressing that we have lost so many but it is also kind of encouraging that we are making because it would mean that we stuck in an endless cycle of technology reinventing the same thing over and but instead we are almost caught up to where we were before our industry did a great and we are getting closer to stepping into genuinely new i were to continue the two progressions of languages that i made i would continue the older one into and the newer one into with the new features being something like and was actually inspired by simula i and not simula but alan team paid a lot of attention to simula 67 in the i read somewhere i find the link that simula begin was required reading in the learning research group at xerox by glomek at denatale collection is nearly as old as the use of mathematical formulas in programming lisp is of the same vintage as fortran and cobol initial conception of programming purposely left out inheritance as he like the way dahl and nygaard had done it in just wrote about concept of

 comments say that the code assumes outputting in however it seem to matter because through a lucky quirk your most significant byte is always to explain that further when your value is at its maximum value of you should be writing but the actual output from your code is which is this happens to be near the proper maximum value of but with the bottom 8 bits all it would be better to always use 32767 as the maximum and then discard the bottom 8 bits if means that even though outputting the effective resolution is only 8 this seems to account for the lack of sound made a version of your code that just dumps the raw data to a and see anything otherwise wrong with the bit shifting no unexpected changes of sign or missing but there is a buzz consistent with 8 bit sample for what worth your math will be easier if you calculate the wave equation based on sample and then worry about byte offsets samples 2 new channels int i j i int wave frequency i byte msb byte lsb for c c if

 config directives can live inside location blocks they are not and very common to do this is you should have no trouble setting this up using only 1 instance of of the great things about this is that you can set it up this way initially and then change your mind later by switching the location block to pass through to a backend server without any of that being visible to the outside go ahead and do it on one server knowing that you can put in a backend server or cluster later as you need to scale	
 conforming to the protocol set your object as the you need to do that explicitly either in the nib or in as already only one object can be a delegate at one having multiple delegates may make sense in some for example if you have a table view that displays two sets of you could make two delegate and datasource objects for and switch between them as it probably make sense to do this for the delegate since the code there is pretty in mind that sometimes an object will send notifications in addition to calling delegate a lot of time it looks like the same since the object will automatically subscribe your delegate to the notification if it includes a certain method the key difference though is that other objects besides the delegate can also subscribe to these so you can hook them up to multiple objects at

 contemplating how to go about this and i think this is one of the key pieces of infrastructure that not having around keeps us in the dark hopefully this will be a popular question on not just that you could install a single tool to collect this because not possible but ideally you want everything from the hardware up to the applications on the network feeding into this think the only approach that makes sense is a modular the range of devices and types of information is too disparate to come under a single also the collection of data needs to be as passive and asynchronous as possible the reality of running infrastructure means that there will be interruptions and you rely on being able to get the data at all think the tools pointed out form something of an ecosystem that could work together cobbler can install from and hand over to which has support for generating nagios and storing configs in a for me only cacti is a bit opaque in terms of programmatically inserting new templates but i know this is you have to sit down and work out which pieces of information are important for the business you work and design a db schema around work out how to get the information you need into the whether from or direct snmp you asked about collection of i think if you have quite disparate kit hp then it makes sense to create a library to abstract away as much as possible the differences between so your scripts just make standard calls such as when you add new hardware you can add to the library rather than having to write a completely new

 could maintain a list and an you add an item to you also add the list to the index with the string as you can get the correct list list loose some performance and memory when building the but you gain a lot when retrieving the the string is not you could also store a in the to allow multiple results per index no this look that but you have a fast and imho the lookup code is more	
 could make changestatus and add to it the call to a customchangestatus method that could be abstract class abstractincomingcall final void parameters in class abstract void abstract boolean could even implement an empty method for customchangestatus so you need to always implement the final in the changestatus you are sure that will be the logic when calling your and you still have the flexibility to add custom behavior to	
 could make this work similarly to what happens when you hover over a live variable in visual editor when in debug you get a tooltip showing the names and values for all properties of that and when hovering over any of the items in that list you get additional popups for those details as in that way you can drill down and get what you need just by moving the having the ability to lock any of these views down into your watch window would be a bonus as hope this	
 could mark the constructor that takes the argument with the verified that this works and prevents the creation of the spurious temporary object a performance anyone using that constructor could no longer rely on compiler type conversion for you function would change to char new return but i think that is necessarily a bad thing in this case as automatic type conversions can be

 could preprocess the source code files before compilation to add a random amount of random code that actually do it would be simple enough to add innocuous comments in the real source code where you wanted your junk code to be as far as what you do when you are not trying to do my suggestions would be not to loop or wait for too or allocating too much i would err on the side of not caring what the size of the binary output and letting that vary possibly the easiest and most effective way to accomplish that might be to just include some libraries that get and yet get optimized out because they were not if you have your compiler call something quick just so that the lib will get included for your final binaries would differ in size by quite a bit that but the program be appreciably any	
 could probably detect inactivity on your web page using the mousemove tricks but that tell you that the user on another page in another window or or that the user is in word or or wow and just looking at your page at this generally just do the prefetch and rely on the if you need this functionality you do something with an activex control in but ugly at

 could probably monkeypatch it if you really wanted this is a nasty habit and could cause arguably less maintainable than just patching source	
 could produce a hash based on the file contents there are two good reasons to do you to never store the same file twice for if you have two copies of a music file which are identical in content you could check to see if you have already stored that and just store it separate name is just meta from the so you would have a storage system which is indexed by the hash of the file and you then associate the file with that hash lookup risk of finding two files that compute the same hash that indeed the same depending on the size of the hash would be and you can effectively mitigate that by perhaps hashing the file in chunks could then lead to some interesting storage optimisation scenarios

 could use distributed file system which is built into the server done this to accomplish a similar you configure dfs to create a which is really just a you might create which looks like a although it is dfs leverages the dns to present it as a valid within the you might create links which are just paths to physical file shares on any number of these would be the equivalent of subdirectories under your for each you can create multiple in your it would be a share on each of the dfs will then replicate files in those shares across all paths listed as using the file replication works very well for the two servers i have it i know how well it would scale when replicating to an enterprise level but not sure that number of machines would be administratively because you are spanning you probably need to replicate at that but rather use this as a like the abstraction that it the path is a you have to have the file replication service i think also need a domain environment to really make this

 couple of ideas that leap to length you could always generate phrases by picking words from a for a good example of this in see length is more use a list of syllables and the result would be a nonsense but pronounceable you might need to filter the results to remove undesirable actual pronounceable is not but you want to be able to quickly verify a code as coming from your then a small crc of a counter packed into a byte array and encoded with or similar would you can improve the human factors by keeping the code and by picking an encoding that eliminates similar letters have and all in the the code needs to be longer than about 5 characters in then consider adopting a standard punctuation scheme that breaks it into is much harder than to read and the number five here is a wild there is probably literature on the best this is really a crypto if there is significant real value to be had from forging these then consult a crypto expert for a best practices answer because rolling your own will cause grief

 couple of source not for the it matter what you we tend to spin up an subversion account for each client so they have a place to log bugs as but the critical first step is getting the full source tree of your site into version when changes are made on the testing server or staging you see if they you then you update on the live rollbacks and deployment gets a lot for clusters of multiple webheads you can repeat the or rsync from a single you use you can also use cvs checkouts of drupal and other and the metadata will be able to live beside each other bulky folders like the files use a symlink in the location to point to a directory outside of the that lets your source control repo include all the code and a instead of all the code and all the files users have are cleaning up the db and pushing it to live is easiest for the initial rollout but there are a few wrinkles when doing incremental db updates if users on the live site are also generating did a presentation on deployment best last feel free to check the slides

 created a crossplatform installation tool after some frustrating experiences with installanywhere and specially its cousin installshield more than half of our clients use our tool to package software but the tool is not that means we have a number of advantages such as native look and feel and no need to do previous to installation less space to mention a to answer your specific calling java code as part of the installation at multiple points in time as when a certain page is files being at uninstall the code is not compiled in the but it can be called externally and the result used in the if you are more specific about which kind of code that you need i can provide specific sample we have a lot of actions for functionality that needs to be manually added to other so you may not need to write that code in the first support all versions of including 64bit and windows 2008 customers have certified on those platforms using our support bundled applications including jboss and take a look at for examples of such stacks that we have support copying and moving substituting values in config unpacking files and most other common installation one of our principles is that the installer should provide support for common installation actions and have an clean interface for invoking external code that is specific to a support bundling as you mention is often enough just to bundle the jre directory and setting the appropriate value for in the launching can take a look at some of our such as installbuilder is a commercial but we offer free licenses for open source projects and discounts for small business and

 creating the dictionary to handle the lookups of the various cases in the switch statement instead of making several branching ifs out of it to set the return trust me you want to change how doing it unless you want to make the map i had originally assumed that the dictionary stored a map from each case to the an index into another map for the return according to it actually stores an index to a label for the code that should be executed for that this makes absolute sense when you consider that the code that would be executed for each case may differ and may be much longer than in the given based on your i think i might be tempted to store the mappings in an external configuration read them in during start and construct the actual map either a single level map from key to value or a similar multilevel map from key to index and index to i think it would be easier to maintain these mappings in a configuration file than to update the code every time you needed to add or remove a particular

 current solution to the problem is to use stacked git and maintain these local changes as separate when i need to dcommit into i do pop naming the patches that should not be commit the rest of the patches to svn push naming the patches that are used nice thing about maintaining these as separate patches is that i can easily have patches that modify my unit tests to test different database so normally i test against but if i want to check against i push if i want to test against i push and are the patch maintaining separate patches of work is very easy with

 decision process for me is pretty all new development will be done with existing sites that need minor modifications will continue to be existing sites that need major modifications will be candidates to move to basic reason that making the switch has to do with testability and imo mvc web sites are significantly more i can test everything but the view logic with unit tests by using and testing htmlhelper extensions i can even test a fair amount of view with webforms i had to jump through lots of hoops to test codebehind and as a result left a lot of the app for manual also feel that the architecture is simply better from a design because of the clear separation of concerns less tempting to insert business logic in the wrong place the it makes conceptualizing and understanding the application much also able to reuse even view code with less effort because i have extraneous bits of logic from other layers hanging around to get in the only real downside i see at present is that not as mature and you already have as many reusable components built for i expect that to over even though it is possible to intermix mvc with i see retrofitting existing apps as a viable alternative unless there is significant other work to be just my but i would rather start from scratch with mvc than try and get an existing app to work with i suppose it would depend on the size of the but anything with any significant number of pages is going to have a lot of routing

 depends on the character encoding you are in character or a single byte inside a character can never be mistaken for another then as long as the string you are searching in and the string you are using to search are in the same encoding then you can continue to use the regular string search you are using a encoding other than which does not prevent single bytes within a character from appearing like other then it is never safe to do a string search using the regular string search you may find false this is because string comparison in functions such as strpos is and with the exception of which is specifically designed to prevent this encodings suffer the problem that any subsequent byte in a character made up of more than one byte may match part of a different the string you are searching and the string you are searching for are of different character then conversion will always be otherwise find that for any string that would be represented differently in the other it will always return you should do such conversion on decide on a character encoding your app will and be consistent within the any time you receive input in a different convert on the way

 depends on the regular expression itself if it is efficient or what it makes inefficient is and to avoid the regular expression has to be as distinct as take the regular expression as an example and apply it to the string the algorithm will first match the literal in to the in next the expression will be in the normal greedy where multipliers are expanded to the it will match to the whole rest in than the last literal in will be but as the end of the string is already reached and a mulpliplier is in the algorithm will try backtracking to match the whole the match of will be decreased by one character and the algorithm tries to comply the rest of the but the in match the in so will be decreased by one more character until it matches the empty string is repeated zero and the in matches the in you can applied to needs 6 backtracking approaches for until the whole regular expression but if we alter the regular expression and make it distinct by using there is be no backtracking necessary and the regular expression can be matches within the first if you now consider using lazy modifiers to tell that this rules apply to every both the greedy and lazy the difference is instead of first expanding the match to the maximum and than doing backtracking by decreasing the match one character at a time the lazy modifiers will first be expanded to the minimum match and than be increased one character at a

 develop and operate a blogging application in which user data a scattered across many 50 other are able to close their and their must disappear from the site right we also must be able to undelete their for a given and also to make those data available for juridic authorities for another the years and different we used different flag everywhere each table has a which is updated when data is very nasty because it slows down every list generation creates a lot of updates upon it does not handle the two stage deletion described in fact we never used this but worth it for each we create a second table with the same schema plus two extra fields the extra fields are used to know if the data is still accessible for when to delete and it was deleted in the first this version is just a bit better than the previous but can be very nasty performance wise too when tables are you have to change the schema of some tables remove unique which makes the system harder to for new administrators and mentally healthy people in same approach as but we move data on a different database which allows to browse those data without impacting the for this the uniqueness constraint is done at the java so all the schemas are the the double data retention constraint is done by having a dedicated db for each which makes things have to admit that none of those approaches satisfies even if they can work up to a certain amount of i have also imagined that we could just delete some key rows in the and let the rest inconsistent scheduled for a more controlled deletion but it scares me you know other ways of doing the same keeping the same level of features could align the two durations to simplify the not looking a solution for my existing but would like to improve the next input will be highly appreciated to efficiently unpublish all datas from a particular user on a blogging

 difference is that if you get that result into a reference yourself you can track the changes of the integer member variable in your own variable name without recalling the x might have probably not the best design and very dangerous to return a reference or in case a variable that gets freed from scope is so if you return a be careful to be sure it is not a variable that goes out of is a slight difference for the modifier but again probably not something that is worth doing or that was int 1 or something else another thread could have changed int x return the end result is that you obtain changes even after the parameters are

 does sounds like fragmentation is caused by you allocating objects on the then deleting some now have a hole in the memory that is if you allocate another object too big for the the hole will remain eventually with enough memory you can end up with so many holes that they waste you way around this is to try and decide your memory requirements up if got particular objects that you know you are creating many try and ensure the same can use a pool to make the allocations more efficient for a particular or at least let you track it better so you can understand going on and come up with a good way of doing this is to create a single bool byte need to tune the value 20 to what your program need to pick a good pool size the pool up front when your program starts and it so that it is as big as the maximum requirements for your you may want to heapalloc it the equivalent in your os so that you can control when it appears from somewhere in you application override the new and delete operators for a suspect class so that they return slots from this your objects will be stored in this can override new and delete for classes of the same size to be put in this pools of different sizes for different go for the worst offenders at done something like this before and it solved my problem on an embedded i also was using a lot of so i created a custom allocator for stl custom allocator there are loads of this was useful for records stored in a my program

 domain of interest is string assume i have a structure like char int end of list are a fixed number of strings in the they are hard coded as in the the table there would be a need to the quality of the hash want to apply a hash function to a and if the string matches one in the call the a perfect hash function is needed for no collisions are purpose of requiring hashing is to get performance on the ideas do you have on designing a function to do would you go about designing a function for a perfect	
 done a brief google around and found nothing but i feel i ought to not really expecting there to be but would rather ask a question with no answers now than ask the question when all going wrong and discover that everyone knew about a make overall life easier to madexcept about to take a app written in d5 nativedb to connect to and port it to eventually to turn it into a console app a present gui is little more than than a glorifed button and an activity a classic tserversocket listening on a specified port and to do various things when clients not expecting any huge problems with the nativedb side of but i wondered if there were any changes between d5 and d2007 as far as tserversocket use blocking indy etc just tserversocket from the scktcomp straight out of the d5 enterprise not looking to change the code significantly unless there is something very wrong with tserversocket under gotchas moving tserversocket app from d5 to

 done one answer on but now like to add another from a broader sounds like the thing that make this a hard problem is that each driver is basing their actions on mental predictions of what other drivers are going to for instance when i am driving i can tell when a car is likely to pull in front of even before he based on the way he is lining himself up with the gap between me and the car in he in turn can tell that i have seen him from the fact that backing off to make room for so its ok to pull a good driver picks up lots of these subtle and its very hard to the first step is to find out what aspects of real driving are not included in the failed and work out how to put them all models are but some models are suspect that the answer is going to involve giving each simulated driver one or more mental models of what each other driver is going to this involves running the planning algorithm for driver 2 using several different assumptions that driver 1 might make about the intentions of driver meanwhile driver 2 is doing the same about driver is the kind of thing that can be very difficult to add to an existing especially if it was written in a conventional because the planning algorithm may well have side even if its only in the way it traverses a data but a functional language may well be able to do the interdependence between drivers probably means there is a fixpoint somewhere in which lazy languages tend to do better	
 done some reading on the service locator concept it is a way of helping to reduce but requires code coupling to the locator not the container backing the but the locator it is a but can be beneficial in the right situation where it can be helpful is when you have code that does not make use of such as legacy code i am in this boat pulling in required objects via rather than directly creating allows the addition of some i see it as an intermediate step between sl and

 drawing the meshes are you doing if using opengl then there is a much better way to go and save yourself all the all the polygons are always two only reason why you would want to use lighting is if you have an open or partially inverted mesh and you want to somehow indicate what part belong to the inside by having them the problem posing is an open problem in geometry processing and afaik there is no general way that can always determine the as you there are heuristics that work almost approach is reminiscent of a famous choose a vertex on the mesh and shoot a ray from it in the direction of the if the ray hits an even number of faces then the normal is pointed to the if it is odd then the normal is towards to notice not to count the point of origin as an this approach will work only if the mesh is a closed manifold and it can reach some edge cases if the ray happens to pass exactly between two polygons so you might want to do it a number of times and take the leading

 dynamic array is declared the same way regardless of the number of dimensions in lotusscript can have up to 8 according to your example i think it is a two dimensional array you where the first dimension is limited to three you first declare the array as can then specify bounds according to the following 0 to 0 to 9 a two dimensional if you need to enlarge the array later keep all the you can do it like preserve 0 to 0 to 99 keep in mind that only the bounds of last dimension can be changed once the number of dimensions of the array has been

 e built a basic dal which can retrieve data and a businesslayer with several objects using this once i mapped the data into the business objects and done something with i also want to write the data back to the some of the business objects have a lot of so passing every value of a business object as parameter to a method of the corresponding dataservice is not a ways been thinking the business object to the the corresponding data there execute a sp with all the values as because i have to pass a business object to the dal the and probably end up with sps with an empty dataset within the business fill it with the values from the business pass that dataset to the data service and update the db via a i thought of creating an empty dataset with a where would that be a good is the first time i do something like the latter sounds better to but maybe there are better or the first one is better for some reasons i you very i use cuz i use express only supports querying local while mine is a remote db from layered best

 easiest way to implement a synchronous method asynchronously is to put it into a and use the and methods on the resulting this will run the synchronous method on a threadpool and will return an so you have to implement the guts of you do need to smuggle a little extra data into the returned by you could do that easily by creating an implementation of that delegates everything to an inner but has an extra field to contain the so that when the instance is passed to you can access the delegate to call on after closer reading of your i see that you need to use an explicit thread with com settings you need to do is properly implement almost everything follows from since the will contain all the bits needed for a very but not terribly implementation of it encapsulates all the essential passing a synchronization callback propagating exceptions from async task and returning myasyncresult object object new manualresetevent new asynccallback exception bool int int public asynccallback object arbitrary public int x get return public void lock never invoke any delegate while holding a if public void lock if public object get return public waithandle get return public bool get return public int lock complex to for memory model lock if throw return public bool get lock return static void myasyncresult ar int x simulate lengthy demo work double catch static iasyncresult asynccallback object thread th new myasyncresult ar new return static int myasyncresult mar return will throw exception if one occurred in background static void demo calling we need state or callback for iasyncresult ar int result important for correctness that client code see the otherwise they might access methods like inappropriately or read the class can be made more efficient by not constructing the implementation in the if not but this is tricky to get the and can and should be disposed of in the as should be done with all objects that implement and should check to make sure that it has gotten an implementation of the right class to get a nicer exception than a cast left these and other details out as they obscure the essential mechanics of the async

 error message maps to source code is available at for limitations on using an sqlite3 database handle from more than one you are allowed to reuse a database handle and statements across threads but one thread must be completely done accessing the database before the other thread starts overlapping access is not that sounds like happening for you and is consistent with the error you need to access the same database from more than one i recommend instead opening the database separately from each thread and setting a timeout using sqlite will then handle contention for blocking for a short time in one thread if the other thread is writing data while still allowing simultaneous

 event is roughly but you can run into performance issues using this event to access rows because of the memory it this is essentially a scheme where the datagridview tries to minimize its memory footprint by sharing some state when possible between rows you access one of the shared which causes it to unshare state and possible performance a lot has been optimized but run into issues with using this event for one reason or if rowsadded works for you with no degradation of if you still have lots of you can derive from the datagridviewcell and datagridview to add custom cell types to the this is probably the most complicated way to customize the but it would allow pretty much any kind of cell manipulation event gives you a hook into the painting of a particular cell if you wish you paint something with before also a event which gives you special event as well but never used that so not sure if the shared memory state issue applies for the painting event it does

 everything described your best bet would be to use the datalist you can specify how many columns wide you want things to be by using the repeatcolumns property and you an even eliminate any sense of by setting the repeatlayout property to will also allow you to not worry about column counting and you could even bind a collection of images for since you requested an it would be as simple as first create your grid and make sure to have a placeholder for the in your code all you would have to do is a simple data not sure how your images are but for the sake of say you had a database query that gave you the urls to each image you wanted to your page load would look something like dtimageurls this is where folks will differ on i prefer to do all my rowbinding type methods in code as opposed to so i then consume the rowdatabound event of my datalist and simply bind the url property protected void image targetimage datarow datasourcerow datasourcerow targetimage that should get you up and note you would need to change your datasourcerow object to whatever type of item you were databinding i was using a datarow since that is the most common scenario i usually

 example suppose i have a class vehicle and i wish for a subclass convertiblevehicle which has extra methods such as i wish to instantiate as convertible new i still have access to common method such as how do i designed such a clarify my two initial neither of which i am happy with dummy methods which i override in convertiblevehicle leaving them to do nothing in other abstract methods and force each subclass to provide an implementation even if it will be blank in all instances other than above seem slightly convoluted since they both pollute the base class as i add an increasing number of subclasses each with their own unique reading some of the responses perhaps there is some type of fundamental flaw in my suppose i have a class vehiclefleet which takes vehicles and instructs them to drive as for i this works for dozens of subclasses of vehicle but for convertiblevehicle i also want to fold the roof before to do so i subclass vehiclefleet as for i leaves me with a messy function stuck in the base class where it really belong which is overridden only in the case of convertiblevehicle and does nothing in all the other the solution works but seems very does this problem lend itself to a better using java although i would hope that a general solution could be found that will work in any object oriented language and that i will not need to rely upon language specific do i design a sub class with features not available in the base

 explanation may not be too academical but this is how i understand it go to university first step involves algebra that proved in the century that any mathematical operation can be expressed using a series of symbols and some associated thus the base 10 arithmetic with the common operators can be expressed in using just two symbols and logic operators or leading to the boolean logic that is the mathematical foundation of digital second step is work that constructed a mathematical model of an imaginary machine that could process the naive description of a turing machine would be any automaton that has memory store operates on a series of symbols that represent state and interprets another series of symbols that define the transition from one state to modern digital processor is an implementation of a turing machine that uses logical algebra as the symbol and operator base a look at a how stuff works explanation of logic at the reason for this is that the logical states can be easily mapped to electrical signals and their associated operators can be implemented in transistor circuits that given a binary input can output the result according to the boolean so any modern computer is a machine that has store state in binary and an array of circuits that accept electrical impulses and operators processor and output results accordingly at a very fast every program written in any computer language is eventually translated by the compiler or runtime into a series of boolean operations for the processor to

 expressions allow you to write a custom machine in a compact to process a string of there are at least two reasons why using regular expressions is software development involves a lot of paper and careful regular expressions fit into this model very because to write an effective expression properly involves a lot of staring at visualizing the paths of the software developers would much rather hammer out and use a debugger to step through to see if the code is regular expressions do not support this working style very one of a regular expression is effectively an atomic hard to observe stepwise execution in a too easy to write a regular expression that accidentally accepts more input than you the value of a regular expression really to match valid to to match invalid techniques to do for regular expressions are not very or at least not widely goes to the point of regular expressions being hard to just by looking at a regular it takes a lot of concentration to visualize all possible inputs that should be but are mistakenly ever try to debug someone regular expression a resistance to using regular expressions among software developers i think chiefly due to these two

 fastest solution going to get will probably involve storing your dictionary in a create a queue of triplets where each element in the queue corresponds to a prefix of a word which can be spelled in the ending at location initialize the queue with x elements is the size of your one element for each square in the the algorithm proceeds as the queue is not dequeue a triple for each square with letter c adjacent to if is a output if is a prefix of a insert into the you store your dictionary in a testing if is a word or a prefix of a word can be done in constant time you also keep some extra metadata in each queue such as a pointer to the current node in the so the running time of this algorithm is of words that can be an implementation in python that i just coded def if parent is not dict root for word in curnode for letter in if 97 nextnode if nextnode is nextnode curnode return rows cols queue words for y in for x in c node if node is not while node del for dy in y2 x y if 0 x2 cols and 0 y2 s2 s node2 if node2 is not if return this program output or filter by word length at easy to add but not really relevant to the it also outputs some words multiple times if they can be spelled in multiple if a given word can be spelled in many different ways every letter in the grid is the same and a word like is in your then the running time will get horribly filtering out duplicates and sorting is trivial to due after the algorithm has

 few although i think any of them will help main thing is that painting off of the awt override and instead call on the this can cause all sorts of problems recreate colors every this may or may not be one of those things that you want to i think though that having a constant for your colors is likely to screw up gcing and will make things easier to keep straight when you want to reuse colors redraw the entire window every you just need to repaint the sections that need to draw the set the background color and let the parent take care of a design the bodies should be in charge of drawing their owner should notify them that they need to be drawn rather than drawing bodies recreate their state every consider having them store it between times and mutate them as you may be spending a lot of time doing trig calculations in the to consider is setting up a timer rather than using a sleep in a while this will get you a more consistent frame but you need to make sure that you can actually meet your obligations coalesce multiple frames into one if you miss a or end up creating too many using a to do the then update the state in the finishing by calling are just a few you should experiment to see what works and what been a while since done java graphics

 find this question to be a little bit assuming using a version control such as you will have a repository on the central server and work in progress on how do you back up the how do you back up work in the answer to those questions is exactly what you have to do to handle your distributed version repositories on servers are just work in do you want to back it then back it as simple as have an automated backup system that grabs any directories off our our machines which we so i add any repositories and working copies on my machine to that including both git and cvs the if you are using distributed version control in a company releasing a then you have a central the one you release it might not be on a special it might be on some hard but the repository you release from is the central suppose if you you might not have i kind of feel that all projects have one or more central really if they have more than two projects and one is a this goes for open source as if you have a central the solution is the back up work on you should have been doing that the fact that the work in progress is in distributed repositories instead of cvs working copies or straight nonversioned directories is

 first assumption is your second it depends on whether it is a post back or not if you are binding if it is not the post back and binding happens automatically roughly the value of the controlparameter is retrieved when datasourceview calls select on right before onselecting the sequence for the gridview any given control for that is as from either sqldatasource or is where values get retrieved using almost for each control in a control the framework recursively calls which then triggers retrieval of data and it is a then those parameters will get loaded from a viewstate on the in the order they are this what you were looking assume controlparameter is bound to property c1 of a control i would imagine that on postbacks controlproperty would always be able to get value from no matter of what type c and even if c has viewstate not entirely how it on post back on initial request for that view state is evaluated only to see if it changed so that the onparameterchanged event could get the actual value of the controlparameter is evaluated against the control it points to in your case be when it reads its value is most likely read from a view but at no point does the controlparameter read view state but may i ask if a page is created for the first a value for controlparameter also be retrieved from the moment lstcities retrieves data from data has its value the at that point first time page the lstcities did not retrieve any data the first time a property evaluation happens is on but before any databind happens shortly when gets the crude trying to place it in a life cycle of a subscribes to loadallstate view state gets raisepostbackevents handle your that following sections assume that you did not do any data inside your is where parameters at this point none of them are data bound if it the first there are no the viewstate is empty for the databind you parameters evaluate their control c would be bound at this controlparameter evaluates and thus retrieves value after c has been controlparameter retrieves values whenever it is which in this scenario happens in two onloadcomplete and databind by on the c is not on after the c is both times controlparameter is asked to read maybe following will are classes and methods of interest in a place them in perspective of the page cycle and hopefully it will be class controlparameter public string controlid in public string propertyname in protected override object control control sourcecontrol using return internal void control or read stored value initial load it is object storedvalue the actual value for this parameter from object actualvalue received a change event if if null storedvalue null actualvalue class sqldatasource by private void eventargs simply calls the updatevalue for each class sqldatasourceview private sqldatasource method gets called by databind on protected internal override ienumerable dbconnection connection dbcommand command is where controlparameter will read values this will be already populated by its own sqldatasourceselectingeventargs e new if return data from data or private void parametercollection idictionary exlusions parameter values from for the iordereddictionary values parameters collection using commandparameters and retrieved so controlparameter checks whether its viewstate to the updatevalue method above to see how it uses i assume controlparameter checks whether its viewstate changed only so that it can fire onparameterchanged but why is handling that event so know that it is i like any other it allows you to track changes in properties and act accordingly to your it gets fired in many but i see where anyone subscribes to property evaluation you mean controlparameter checking its own thus you mean controlparameter evaluating which i assume happens after c has been bound means that the gets which checks viewstate for stated then calls which then finds a control and retrieves data using reflection see presume that by update you mean if is called when data binding takes then what that means is that when on next postback is called in and controlparameter will already have same you are forgetting that the view state is loaded on loadallstate and between it and the onloadcomplete there are six more steps page each of those may modify the source you have and did a post the view state for all controls is loaded if stored value in the view it will load on you decide to set here may decide to store in its view state or not then other events next comes since sqldatasource subscribes to this it will evaluate all associated parameters since you did change but view state did null storedvalue null actualvalue return true and onparameterchanged will be by the there is at least ten other places where this event gets it play big role in data binding and property retrieval	
 first bit of advice would if you ever find yourself saying using can create a then you should immediately start looking for a get out of the procedural mindset when using are still a few fuzzy parts to your does a call count as being during a minute period if it simply has any portion of the call during that for if a call starts at 1923 and lasts 62 seconds is it considered to overlap with all calls starting at going to assume yes on that but you can adjust the code below if not it should be a minor the breakdown to minutes i would usually use a table with time spans a start time and end time for each of the slices in which in your case since you are dealing with exact minutes and your start times are in minutes if the data type is screwed just going to use a single column with the exact minute in set up that table int not constraint primary key clustered insert into values 100 set if set set we can select for the outer join r between as as as carryover to as 60 need to either use that as a subquery to get the averages over a given since late on friday leave that step up to you one last i account for time spans that cross day boundaries go past hopefully the code points you in the right direction for a better approach might be to create a view that turns all of those nasty strings into actual datetime then this becomes really trivial with the minutes

 first example is functionally the same as the second this syntax should be avoided for several first it is much easier to accidentally get a cross join when using this syntax especially when there are mulitple joins in the if you see a lot of this type of query with the keyword you probably have someone who is trying to fix the cross the left and right join syntax using the older style is deprecated and will no longer be it work correctly now sometimes it misinterprets the outer join and sends back the wrong results so any queries you have using or in the where clause should immediately be ansi standard joins are easier to understand and an understanding of joins is one of the most critical basic skills that anyone querying any relational database needs to it has been my experience that some people who use the older style really understand joins and how they work and thus write queries that do not actually do what they

 for know that a ref parameter in passes a to a allowing the external variable itself to be changed within a called but is the reference handled much like a c pointer the current contents of the original variable with every access to that parameter and changing the original variable with every modification to the or can the called method rely on a consistent reference for the duration of the the former brings up some thread safety in written a static method in which passes an object by static void definition caller provides a completed but and after some consistency checking we the definition they if there is already a definition with the same it register the new one and instead their reference is updated to the for that want this to be rigorously but a pathological scenario comes to suppose the client our shares the reference in an such as using a static member rather than a local static definition riskyreference one thread sets new fills out the and calls our while another thread also decides to set new are we guaranteed that in our register method the reference handling will not be modified on us by other threads the reference to the object was copied in and will be copied out when we or can that other thread replace the object on us in the middle of our execution referencing a pointer to the original storage and thus break our that this is different from changes to the underlying object which are of course possible for a reference type but can be easily guarded against by appropriate locking within that we guard changes to an external variable space we would have to make our own copy of the parameter at the top of the method and overwrite the parameter at the bottom but that would seem to make more sense for the compiler to do for us given the insanity of handling an unsafe tend to think that the reference may be copied in and copied out by the compiler so that the method is handling a consistent reference to the original object it changes its own reference when it wants regardless of what might be happening to the original location on other but having trouble finding a definitive answer on that point in documenation and discussion of ref anyone assuage my concern with a definitive for confirmed it with a code example and thinking about it it makes sense that it is indeed the behavior which i was worred one point of is to pass large structs by reference rather than copy another reason is that you might to set up a monitoring of a variable and need to pass a reference to it which will see changes to the variable changing between null and a live which an automatic would not allow to make our method robust against client we could implement it static void definition definition thedefinition copy sanity actual changing thedefinition to a new definition newdefinition copy still have their own threading issues as far as what they end up but at least their insanity break our own process and possibly slip a bad state past our ref parameters or vulnerable to unsafe multithreaded

 found a zsh developers do not think that zsh should define the actions of the and ubuntu fix this by defining the normal actions the average user would expect in the global pasted the relevant code messed up when i paste it as code in stack it is the same on debian and if you are connecting to a debian or ubuntu you have to do everything should work automagically see if you are connecting to another box their might be no user friendly default the solution is of course to add the lines from the zshrc to your own sends xterm as terminal type to the remote but messes up somewhere and send the correct control codes for that one would expect from an or an xterm terminal expected to send those or key does work in xterm if you configure it in also notice that your num pad keys act funny in vim for example with xterm solution is to configure putty to send another terminal tried and fixed the but the num pad was still setting it to fixed both can set terminal type in putty under connection do not be tempted to set your terminal type in your with that is just the terminal type should be specified by your terminal so that for you connect from a mac box with a mac ssh client it can set own terminal that term specifies your terminal type and has nothing to do with the host you are connecting i can set my terminal type to linux in putty and connect to freebsd servers without fix both these things and you should be fine

 function timotei posted will give you the length of the string as long as the part of the string you are interested in only contains if you are assigning the values in the program should be true as fortran is supposed to initialize the variables to be empty and for characters that means a if you are reading in from a file you might pick up other control characters at the end of the lines carriage return line feed depending on your you should also toss those out in the function to get the correct string otherwise you could get some funny print statements as those characters are printed as is my version of the function that checks for alternate white space characters at the end besides function integer character i do while i i strlen there are other characters in the section this still work that it does work for your you can then change your write statement to look like it will print out just the actual to whether or not you should use another array to hold the lengths of the that is up to the function is whereas looking up the length in a table is if you find yourself computing the lengths of these static strings it may improve performance to compute the length once when they are read store them in an array and look them up if you need if you notice the i worry about

 gauge it based on how difficult the form was to fill out in the first if a lengthy process information for a mortgage or and you have user you may want to provide them an opportunity to save the uncompleted form and come back to it session is only good for on your tasks that will take less than an manual input of data that is easy to start and easy to finish will be perfect to store a if the person has to stop and root around for some documents in the case of a mortgage or an online tax have a really irate person if the session times out and they have to retype avoid directly injecting content into a since the data is passed for subsequent requests you already have access to basic session you go with a you need to timestamp the access you just leave it around with some saved name as determined by your like 2008 mortgage so you can clean it up if the user does save it just leave it around until they complete the form or delete

 general way it is done is that the number of references to an object are kept track of in the and when that number goes to the object is subject to garbage however the gc will not fire up until it is explicitly needed because it is an expensive what happens when it starts is that the gc goes through the managed area of memory and finds every object that has no references the gc deletes those objects by first calling their allowing them to clean up after then frees the commonly the gc will then compact the managed memory area by moving every surviving object to one area of allowing more allocations to take i said this is one method that i know and there is a lot of research being done in this

 get a similar effect in unix when you sigstop although this depends on your a i believe it stops the process from executing totally and the address while not swapped to disk en can be paged out discarded if reloadable from the due to will restart the possible solution is something we implemented in unix a while make the program responsible for its own start and by passing a parameter to secondary copies of the program would not do any real only communicate to the primary there were four primary copy with or no this would just start the program and let it primary copy with this would start the program which would initialize then send a sigstop signal to itself to secondary copy with this would send a sigcont signal to the primary copy to start it running secondary copies with no parameter would simply complain that a primary was already running then secondary copy with this would send a sigstop signal to the primary copy to make it used shared memory for communicating with the primary since there were many other things a secondary could pass to the but if all you want is stop and start go for storing the pid in a known file and checking to make sure the process name is gives you a nice idiom for a program that can pause and restart just by seemingly running it again with different

 give you the ability to combine two bad traits in one wrong in pretty much every singleton gives access to an guarantee that no more than one object of this type ever be one is globals are generally we should never make objects globally accessible unless we need two may sound like it makes but think about when was the last time you created a new object instead of referencing an existing since this is tagged use an example from that do you often accidentally you intended to course we need protection against this because that kind of error just if it the correct response is to go home and sleep for hours and hope you feel only one object is simply create one if one object should be globally make it a but that mean it should be impossible to create other instances of one instance is constraint really protect us against likely but it make our code very hard to refactor and because quite often we find out that we did need more than one we have more than one we have more than one configuration we do want several our unit tests may want to be able to create and recreate these objects every to take a common a singleton should be used if and only we need the traits it we global access is because globals are generally we to prevent anyone from creating more than one instance of a class sounds to me like a design the only reason i can see for this is if creating two instances would corrupt our application state probably because the class contains a number of static members or similar in which case the obvious answer is to fix that it depend on being the only you need global access to an make it a like but constrain the number of instances that can be you absolutely positively need to constrain the number of instances of a class to and there is no way creating two instances can ever be handled then enforce but make it globally accessible as you do need both then make it a and let me know what you need that because having a hard time imagining such a

 go two links trying to explain you how things i will try to explain it as shortly as i most of what happens inside a windows forms application happens in a single usually the same thread runs if you open you will see that has a line that looks like the you debug the application at any moment and examine the call you will see it will trace back to that run this means that a windows forms application is in fact a continuous run of the run what is run run is eating a message queue through which windows sends messages to run then dispatches those messages to the correct which themselves do things like add text which corresponds to the key being redraw notice that all this happens during and endless loop running alongside a single so weather you are typing or simply moving the window loads of those messages are being passed onto the which in turn is processing them and reacting all in that single controls can also send messages to themselves through the queue and even you can place messages in the pump via one of the things those controls do is to raise events according to what if you click a the code written to handle that click will ultimately and indirectly be run by the what is happening with your code is that even though you are changing the visible status of your progress bar to visible and then updating its you are then changing its visibility to all in the same this means that only after you leave the will be able to continue iterating and consuming the message effectively asking the progress bar to update its when that already left the progress visibility to the last thing you did before exiting the is a quick and dirty workaround to your problem as it reads the messages in the queue and processes i really feel comfortable using it as it can bring reentrancy threads is a good but i would recommend using a threadpool thread instead of a custom thread in this kind of as i tend to use custom threads only in cases where i have a limited number of long lived threads and i need to control their life the easiest and most practical way to use threads is to use the backgroundworker even though i would recommend going through the pains of understanding how to do windows forms multithreading with delegates if you want to really understand what is going

 going to add some words of advice about using a trigger for it is possible to do this with a unlike i think it should be a database issue because all records will need the uniqueness not just ones added through a specific putting logic like this in the application is a bad idea from the standpoint of data ata minumum make sure the filed has a unique most inexperienced trigger developers think that triggers work on each row individually and do not design their trigger to handle multiple row you may think that there are no multiple row you would most of the time be at some point you are going to want to import a group of the trigger must be able to handle using your it can handle only one record at a this is a huge flaw because the only way to handle it in a trigger is through the use of a cursor or while this is extremely slow and could end up locking up your customer table for hours if you have the need to add a lot of customers all at think idea of creating a pool of possible unique passwords is a good one because then you can use logic in the trigger to fill it but to work it you would need three columns identity field to use for grabbing the next 300 rows for you should also schedule a nightly job to generate more potential passwords if the number unused is below a certain that way things will never fail because you unexpectedly ran out of potential

 good example comes from order an order from a customer typically has an order number that identifies the some data that occurs once per order such as the order date and the customer and a series of line each line item contains an item number that identifies a line item within an a product the quantity of that the price of the and the amount for the line which could be computed by multiplying the quantity by the number that identifies a line item only identifies it in the context of a single the first line item in every order is item number the complete identity of a line item is the item number together with the order number of which it is a parent child relationship between orders and line items is therefore an identifying a closely related concept in er modeling goes by the name where line item is a subentity of a subentity has a mandatory identitying relationship to the entity that subordinate classical database the primary key of the lineitems table would be some of designers would give an item a separate that serves as a primary and is autoincremented by the i recommend classical design in this

 good info to change of file versions and assembly versions need not coincide with each i recommend that file versions change with each change assembly versions with each build just so that you can tell the difference between two versions of the same use the file version for deciding when to change assembly versions takes some discussion of the types of builds to shipping and builds i recommend keeping assembly versions the same between shipping this avoids assembly loading problems due to version some people prefer using publisher policy to redirect new assembly versions for each i recommend against that for it avoid all of the loading for if a partner your they may not know to install publisher your app will be broken for even though it works just fine on your if there are cases where different applications on the same machine need to bind to different versions of your i recommend giving those builds different assembly versions so that the correct one for each app can be used without having to use builds for whether a good idea to change that version for shipping it depends on how you want the binding to work for do you want these builds to be or are there many changes between the two are they going to break some do you care that it breaks them do you want to force users to use your important if you should consider incrementing the assembly then consider that doing that too many times can litter the disk with outdated you change your assembly versions change hardcoded versions to the new i recommend setting a variable to the version in a header file and replacing the hardcoding in sources with the run a during the build to put in the correct i recommend changing versions right after not right so that more time to catch bugs due to the

 good to be in good have a similar situation on my in my a task and trying to find the other people in my role in other whenever i meet the experience is and i learn a lot of good tips but i want that to happen more company also has so good to hear that other people have the same problem connecting with this tool that is theoretically about connecting and sharing trying a collection of things to see what so the person to person ennabled with email and our internal im system are the best connections but that involves a person to person stuff i had in via still a since anything public involves a certain amount of care and and the things i want to connect with others on do not lend themselves to the necessary level of corporate diplomacy needed to for a topic area our company has a see how well they it seems best when there is a group that is the who provides some basic level content for everyone else to feed off someone has to be bulletin we actually have mostly they have notices for one time but one thing we have are and sessions about specific technical a similar session for a roundtable on an issue or technical area might be valuable although it will only catch people in the local i started doing a lightwieght version i have lunch monthly with a friend who is a and we are inviting sooner or i hope be the software task manager suport and a natural place for like minded people to come hang social been prevailing upon the sharepoint portal people no to suggest that the difficulty with sharepoint is the lack of human social networks like and facebook all have the concept that you have through people form traversible webs based on interests and shared this is what i think sharepoint is most the really ambiguous need of finding people who know something about my current tasks and who might be able to help at least i think that last one is the big as we thrive on not just getting the info we but also being able to judge it against what we know about the source of a wiki is great for factual but the reason to interface with other humans to have that particular quality of interaction that is much messier than bare to get that in an online context you need connection to lightwieght topic and a chance to make some things access controlled so that people can speak their minds without corporate

 had a similar compiler that implemented a bizarre version of the we had which would call constructors for us and destructors were called most the vendor went and implemented and using and as a to the the problem was that they never mentioned that a would not cause destructors of local objects to be our group inherited the code base after someone wrote an application acting like it was standard using raii techniques and all of the other we ended up rewriting it in what a number of us call you might want to consider just biting the bullet and writing in straight instead of have an explicitly called initialization destructors become an explicitly called termination there much of that you mimic in c pretty mi is a pain in the but single inheritance is pretty take a look at for some it almost describes the approach that we i really wish i had written our method down

 had implemented this for a however it was not too complicated and a simple one my clients budget was quite i displayed related articles based on score the better the chances of showing an article as score depends upon few simple match the tags of any article with existing articles in database has the highest so if 3 tags i multiply with that way score match the title of article with subjects of existing articles in database after removing common words i used sql server free text to give me rank for i multiply this rank with so if 3 words the score then add the scores from above 2 and display them in high to low 1 very important point here i also allowed my client to explicitly specify related so if my client explicitly specified 2 then i would show those 2 first and then run my algorithim to show remaing 3 on the list in know its a simply not perfect but i had to build this keeping my clients budget in you can always add a lot more factors to this matching the date to oldest popularity of comments and etc this

 happens because always queries the this is a design they do it this because else they would have to execute the query against the against the local cache and then merge the as one of the developers pointed out in a blog remeber where they were unable to handle this you can imagine there are a lot of corner an edge cases you have to handle you could just find a id you created created by someone else in the this would force you to be prepeared to handle conflicts on every maybe they could have made methods to querry the local cache and methods to query the but that is not to may have a look at lazy loading for entity this replaces the normal code generator and you get entites that populate their related entiy collections and entity references automaticaly on this avoids all and you can query the collections because they are always implicitly but this solution is not there are some for if you create a new entity and access a collection of releated you will get an exception because the code is unable to retrieve the releated entities from the there is also an issue concerning data binding and may be some more i am not aware good thing is that you get the source code and are able to fix the issues yourself and i am going to examin the first issue if i find some but i am quite sure that it will not be that easy to because i exspect some case were just not hitting the database if the entity has just been created is not the exspected

 hard answering this since you already link to articles that explains the let me try garbage collection you have memory and since gc will run your you have but resource is in the sense that you know things will be cleaned it is since you know when it will if you open a file and lock it while you have it not knowing when the file will become available to open again later on is but the guarantee that at some point it will be closed is and idisposable serves that bad part by adding deterministic resource you choose when to dispose of your closing the the network the database your and you will typically dispose of the resource when you no longer need when you no longer need the you dispose of the object keeping it the object will stay in memory memory for a while but the file will be closed when you say ready to be opened again right you gain deterministic handling of and couple that with memory management and you got the best of two

 have a application written in a small but growing amount of it has evolved over the years with many features you would expect in a large files that make it hard to isolate testable that are too complex to be easily this code is targeted for embedded a lot of overhead to run it on the actual so we would like to do more of our development and testing in quick on a local but we would like to avoid the classic strategy of into a file on your fix if developers are going to to go the trouble to do like to be able to recreate the same tests and run in an automated our in order to refactor the code to be more we need it to be more but in order to introduce automated unit we need it to be more problem is that since our files are so we might have a function inside a file that calls a function the same that we need to stub out to make a good unit it seems like this would be less of a problem as our code gets more but that is a long way thing we thought about doing was tagging to be source code with then we could write a script scan source files for testable compile it in a separate and link it with the unit we could slowly introduce the unit tests as we fix defects and add more there is concern that maintaining this scheme with all the required stub will become too much of a and developers will stop maintaining the unit so another approach is to use a tool that automatically generates stubs for all the and link the file with only tool we have found that will do this is an expensive commercial but this approach seems to that all our code be more modular before we can even since only the external calls can be stubbed i would rather have developers think about their external dependencies and intelligently write their own but this could be overwhelming to stub out all the dependencies for a horribly line it might be difficult to convince developers that they need to maintain stubs for all their external but is that the right way to do other argument heard is that the maintainer of a subsystem should maintain the stubs for their but i wonder if developers to write their own stubs would lead to better unit of add another whole dimension to the have looked at several based unit test and there are a lot of options that look but we have not found anything to ease the transition from of code with no unit to here are my questions to anyone else who has been through is a good starting are we going in the right or are we missing something tools might be useful to help with the since our budget right now is roughly our build environment is so we use any do you introduce unit testing into a legacy

 have a nsis installer that we previously built using nant scripts that copy some files around and run via a exec task to build the installer after the nant script i have the compelte structure for our cd and also our was just doing a get from sourcesafe onto an unused desktop and using it as a build compiling sometimes we would have a couple of files checked in that fix something in those cases i would go to the build and very selectively get only those to avoid getting other changed files that we ready to release basically i am able to allow development to continue and selectively include certain changed files into the installer for we no longer have a free and need to build from our so i am setting up ci factory so that the developer can kick the build off without remoting into the the one issue i am struggling is the best way to continue to allow this selective change control to the default concept of ci that ci factory implements is fine for internal development i also want to setup a ccnet project that is run only on demand via a force build for this type of is what brain stormed so without being sure how well this will if at figuring out what ccnet and ci factory are all the ccnet project would be setup such that it would get modifications would trigger a since the other ccnet project that is using the default ci call it the of getting latest when changes are then these two projects share the same working so the would need a different working so that its files get updated when the ci build is the developer would need to remote into the one selectively do a get into the working and then force a build through ci i see with this having to remote in to selectively do i have no idea how to allow a single ci factory project to have two different working copies of the product so that each project configuration block has afraid of what kind of strangeness this might not quite sure yet how to specify a source control block in ccnet project config but prevent it from doing a get latest when it still gradually figuring out what things are in scripts and can be easily taken out without breaking other versus what is not meant to be mucked around with is not would really like to hear about how others deal with this issue of selectively releasing if you have a similar i am constrained to so my immediate need is to solve this with that in but at the same time be interested in hearing how you manage this with other source control i guess you would probably have a branch that is your latest developments and then merge changes into the trunk whenever you want to release i really trust vss for and i think the branching concepts might be a little too much overhead and learning curve for this like i said stories with other source control systems would be useful future knowledge for in integration of changes with continuous

 have a project involving a web voting the current values and related data is stored in several historical data will be an important aspect of this project so also created audit tables to which current data will be moved to on a regular find this strategy highly even if i only archive data on a daily the number of rows will become huge even if only 1 or 2 users make updates on a given next alternative i can think of is only storing entries that have this will mean having to build logic to automatically create a view of a given this means less stored but considerable final idea is a bit less since the historical data will be for reporting no need for web users to have quick thinking that my db could have no historical data in db only represents current the entire db could be loaded into objects of is relatively and then serialized to something like xml or these files could be diffed with the previous day and in svn could do this for when i want the data for a given past the system has to retrieve the version for that day and deserialize into this is obviously a costly operation but performance is not so much a concern considering using linq for this which i think would simplify the serialization procedure would have to be pretty organized for the diff to work approach would you controlled database with efficient use of

 have a question regarding wpf binding and converting the data types seen by the ui objects in have a user control that i would like to reuse in different the user control displays a thumbnail image and several textblocks to display person demographic information such as name and the user control is used in an mvvm so bound to a viewmodel specific to the user typical mvvm design the viewmodel for the user control is often embedded in other viewmodels to make up a larger user control view model expects a certain type as its binding the viewmodels in which the vm in embedded have entirely different object so they cannot simply their data to the there needs to be a conversion of the parent data model to the uc data question is is there a sanctioned way to perform this looked at ivalueconverter and imultivalueconverter and these do not look like the way to guess what i need is a sort of shim between the parent vm and the embedded uc vm where the parent data is converted to the format required by the uc does it basically come down to i have to write a custom uc vm to handle whatever types the parent vm data binding and type

 have a set of call detail and from those supposed to determine the average concurrent active calls per per hour a precision of one if i query 7pm to i should see the average concurrent calls for the hour the concurrent calls for each within that hour each i need a way to check for a count of active calls for etc then average those a call is considered active if the time and duration fall within the current minute being makes this even more difficult is that it needs to span sql and sql 2000 functions in 2000 available in such as if i can just get 2000 working be approaches to this problem can i thought about looping through minutes in the hour being checked and adding the count of calls that fall between that minute and then somehow cross referencing the duration to make sure that a call that starts at pm and has a duration of 300 seconds shows active at but i imagine how to approach the i tried to figure out a way to weight each call against particular minute that would tell me if the call was active during that minute or but come up with an effective data types here are the same as i have to query i have any control over the schema than possibly converting the data and inserting into another table with more appropriate data provided some example data that i know has concurrent active table seconds time date dur system port is an stime the difference of seconds from utc to the current utc we use it as an identifier is the time the call was is the day the call was is the duration of the call in is the system is the port on the system particularly relevant for this into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into can i check for average concurrent events in a sql table based on the time and duration of the	
 have a set of javascript functions i use with a table of input elements to enable things like keeping track of the currently focused and overflowing from the end of one row to the start of the i have scrollbar support with a fixed first column by creating one table that is only one column wide as my fixed column and having a scrollbar for the other i have been noticing that the default behavior of the scrollbar is a bit when i navigate to the last firefox leaves that column partially obscured by the scrollbar instead of scrolling far enough to see once i scroll over so i can see the other part of the last when i move on to the next row and the nav code sets focus to a cell in the first column frozen firefox change the scrollbar so i can see all of the first of been looking into how to modify scrollbar positioning using my table use a vertical only a horizontal so i stumbled upon reset scroll to this seems to only work once in a when i enabled firebug and traced through my navigation code where this line it seems to work once in a but most of the this line will run but the tables scroll left property is unchanged and i see a change visually also set scrollleft to a high number so it will be set to the maximum as is described in the and that also does not work once in a use the following code to set up the scrollbar with my to this seems to be something that originated in ie but now works in does this actually not work in firefox as the inhouse project this is for will be firefox trying to figure out is scrollleft known to not work or should i go back and see if screwed something up in my definition of the scrollbar or something along those scroll positioning with javascript

 have a similar situation to you and our solution is to use a our cms app stores the actual files in a database and notifies a publishing service when a file has been created or this publisher then notifies all the subscribing web applications and they then go and get the file from the database and place it on their file have the subscribers set in a config file on the publisher but you could go the whole hog and have the web app do the subscription itself on app startup to make it even easier to could use a unc for the we chose a db for convenience and portability between or production and test environments simply copy the db back and we have all the live site files as well as the

 have a site an application that creates mail merges or based on a couple of user it can generate cartesian joins worth of data without a but in comes the needs of enterprise to make life a bit more have to build the application so after verifying zip codes of remote it creates emails to media targets based on how far from that employee the media target say for instance employees are well known volunteers where they the enterprise wants to email media within a 5 mile radius of these employees a message about the work the employee is this is where things get i have several choices which i will outline the attempts and the largest radius is 20 i create a database table that holds records of every zip code in the joined to every zip code within 20 miles of that zip the dataset looks something like names are different this is for the sake of as an ny has 350k records from the above dataset other states are average load time on that 6 not i verified this by setting it is during the stage that the disconnect one was never implemented due to a logistics i make a database connection for each employee zip to media target zips with a distance of x or except that the source files and the media targets combined can reach upwards of 34k individualized 34k db even if i could devise a way to reuse zip code i did some test checks in the db and found that there are 500 distinct zip codes in ny where employees 500 db i doubt that would work but i could be latest scheme to get around the problem is in that hoping the web server runs a better game then the dataset object by getting a new dataset looks doing a distance formula to figure out if the data this relies heavily on the processors on the web is this a worthwhile or will i find the same load time damage on this attempt as there a better appreciate any even if it confirms my fears that this project might not i have control of the and running sql2k programming the site in visual studio framework might get upgraded to sql2005 and vs2008 within the next few months dataset to long load time

 have an online game where i record lots of gameplay these stats tables get large very and i have to be careful because simply recording more stats can cause the performance to get pretty once the table gets big which a very good is to keep the stats tables i have an automatic process that creates a new table every 24 preventing the performance from getting too but my solution is ugly and is a sort of of stats i use innodb and have set up a couple of indexes to improve and then i just keep 30 of these tables around one is 24 so saving a month of every 24 my automated process deletes the then renames all the numbered tables to have a higher and then it creates a blank table called simply this is the where stats are actively being recorded tables basically record every transaction between every player and every other player in the game that they interact thus an exponential explosion of when a new transaction it checks to see if there is already a row for the transactions between these two players during that if there it updates the row with changes to their it creates a new a pair of players who interact 1000 times in a day and a pair who interact just a single time will both have just a single row in the table for that each action on the database involves a select and then either an update or an so it is pretty even between reads and writes as currently the reading of data in a larger for analysis of stats and multiple players is done very relative to the single updates and there are about rows created per know this could be i easily reduce the amount of data but concerned about and i could increase performance even more by having a new table created every 4 for but then i have to mess with 180 i could make it simpler by just using one and then everything comes to a screeching that i do need to update rows in these so i use something like the archive storage but i only need to insert or update on the stats is also the minor issue that when the daily rotation process any queries coming in at that moment may be it is in the process of renaming all tables and creating a new new entries may losing a few inserts is not a big but a solution where this error or could be done would be for any ideas that might idea for of	
 have an order class which goes through a series of defined to aid with i have implemented the state pattern such that the order object has a currentstate member which implements an iorderstate i then have concrete implementations of this interface such as orderstatedelivered etc question what is the correct way to transition the order object between is it acceptable to have an method which allows an external service to set the the criteria which determine the state changes are stored externally to the order object so this seems the obvious answer but slightly uneasy about having a public method on my object to change something as fundamental as thought it might be useful to add some more detail about my implementation because i wonder if actually using the pattern correctly in the first the pulbic api for creating and authorising an orderfacade as new order add lines this will validate the order and transition it to status valid this will commit the but only if it is at status result function looks something like function originalorder as as if dim validator dim valid if end return end end you can the currentstate member is the current iorderstate implementation which determines which activities are valid for the i wonder whether this should be responsible for determining the transition rather than the should an object using the state pattern be transitioned to the next

 have at least these five options for modeling the type hierarchy you table one table for all product with enough columns to store all attributes of all this means of most of which are null on any given table one table for storing attributes common to all product then one table per product storing attributes specific to that product table no table for common products one table per product storing both common product and one table for storing attributes common to all product one extra column stores a blob of in or some other this blob allows you to store the attributes specific to each product you can use fancy design patterns to describe such as facade and but regardless you have a blob of attributes that be easily queried within you have to fetch the whole blob back to the application and sort it out one table for and one table that pivots attributes to instead of eav is not a valid design with respect to the relational but many people use it this is the mentioned by another see other questions with the on stackoverflow for some of the thoughts about although many people seem to favor i it seems like the most flexible and therefore the keep in mind the adage here are some of the disadvantages of way to make a column mandatory of way to use sql data types to validate way to ensure that attribute names are spelled way to put a foreign key on the values of any given for a lookup results in a conventional tabular layout is complex and because to get attributes from multiple rows you need to do for each degree of flexibility eav gives you requires sacrifices in other probably making your code as complex than it would have been to solve the original problem in a more conventional in most an unnecessary to have that degree of in the question about product much simpler to create a table per product type for so you have some consistent structure enforced at least for entries of the same product use eav only if must be permitted to potentially have a distinct set of when you have a finite set of product eav is class table inheritance would be my first

 have been developing an application that works with the google maps api to assist in logistics and planning for a small shipping company in our one of the features is for the company to input a list of customers and the system will package up all the customer addresses as a series of send it off to and get back the direction information for the problem that we have been having is that many of the addresses in our database are not great and will often times are not able to be processed by google when we do this we receive back an error but i would like to be able to determine which waypoint was the one to fail way the client can then go and fix the address in the here is a chunk of the code that handles the initialization and current error if map new gdir new if function var waypoints new var str waypoints function if corresponding geographic location could be found for one of the specified this may be due to the fact that the address is relatively or it may be else if geocoding or directions request could not be successfully yet the exact reason for the failure is not error else if http q parameter was either missing or had no for geocoder this means that an empty address was specified as for directions this means that no query was specified in the error else if given key is either invalid or does not match the domain for which it was error else if directions request could not be successfully error else unknown error problem is that the method in the gdirections object seem to return status based on each individual but from just the entire list one fails it all only real solution i can think of performing checks in other areas of the is to send each waypoint off to google maps in a separate request and check validity that way prior to sending off the entire waypoints list for the gdirections but that seems incredibly inefficient when dealing with a larger set of customer maps api finding waypoint that caused

 have found that generators are very helpful in cleaning up your code and by giving you a very unique way to encapsulate and modularize in a situation where you need something to constantly spit out values based on its own internal processing and when that something needs to be called from anywhere in your code not just within a loop or a block for generators are feature to abstract example would be a fibonacci number generator that does not live within a loop and when it is called from anywhere will always return the next number in yield yield while yield you have two fibonacci number generator objects which you can call from anywhere in your code and they will always return ever larger fibonacci numbers in sequence as lovely thing about generators is that they encapsulate state without having to go through the hoops of creating one way of thinking about them is as which remember their internal got the fibonacci example from and with a little you can come up with a lot of other situations where generators make for a great alternative to and other traditional iteration

 have objects representing folders and wondering if they should be represented in the the one hand it seems like the easiest way would be to not represent folder objects and just store a path value for objects contained in a problems i see with this is that you persist an folder whose descendants do not contain any which too big of a also i have a clear idea of how to load the folder hierarchy to display as in a without loading everything into memory which would probably be a performance alternative is to have a table with references to its parent this seems like it should but unsure how to allow folders with the same name as long as they do not share a should that even be something the db should be concerning itself with or is that something that i should just enforce in the the business folder hierarchy in relational	
 have one costly function that gets called many times and there is a very limited set of possible values for the return code depends only on arguments so the obvious way to speed things up is to keep a static cache within the function for possible arguments and corresponding return so for every combination of the the costly operation will be performed only always use this approach in such situations and it works fine but it just occurred to me that gcc function attributes or probably can help me with anybody have experience with how gcc uses and attributes only at compile time or at runtime as i rely on gcc to be smart enough to call a declared once for the same parameter or there is no guarantee whatsoever and i better stick to caching my question is not about but gcc function function attributes vs

 have plenty of answers that explain well how to do but for the sake of completion repeat and add to is only ever useful for interactive use you know all your filenames are plain no spaces or or when used with the break is a very useful put using it to pipe filenames into with is rather convoluted as can do it all itself with either command or command depending on what you somecommand somecommand former runs with for each file recursively in that matches latter runs with many arguments as fit on the command at once for files recursively in that match one to use depends on if it can take multiple filename arguments then the latter option is faster you run far less if takes only one argument then you need the former so look at man on is a statement that iterates over if you do something like foo in giving argument to iterate over the if you do something like foo in asking to take the contents of and tear it apart wherever there are tabs or newlines whatever characters are in and use the pieces of that operation as arguments to is not assuming that the result of a tearing long string that contains filenames apart wherever there is whitespace yields in a pile of filenames is just as you have just answer use obviously the wrong the above commands all assume that is an executable in if a need this construct instead over like you but read somebashstatement uses a loop that reads parts of the string outputs until it reaches a byte is what uses to separate the since bytes be part of filenames tabs and this is a safe you need to be part of your script it change the script environment by keeping a counter or setting a variable or some then you can still use to run your bash bash do somebashstatement the executes a command with three or more bash statement to will put this in you can put anything you like filename or filenames on whether you used or the up in if more than of statement in the first command here runs with the filename as statement in the second command here runs a loop that iterates over each positional parameter what the reduced syntax and runs a with the filename as the difference here between the very first statement i showed with is that we run only one process for lots of filenames but still one for of those this is also well explained in the page linked

 have spent a lot of time recently reading the http specification and relating it to i have found that there are two interpretations of the http delete method in regards to its and here are the two you delete a resource with http and it succeeds and then you try to delete that resource n number of you should get back a success message for each and every one of those delete this is its you delete a resource with http and it succeeds and then you try to delete that resource you should get back an error message because the resource was specification says delete is but it also says that sequences of idempotent events can still produce side i really feel like the second camp is and the first is what have we introduced by allowing clients to think they were the cause for deleting a resource previously are a lot of people in the first including several authors on the so i wanted to check if there was some compelling reason other than emotions that lead people into the first the correct way to view idempotency in terms of http

 have suggested very good ways to prevent your css from affecting the as well as making sure that your css takes but you seem most concerned with the css affecting you that adding a unexpected style making all divs have a pink only way i can think for you to prevent their styling from affecting your injected code would be for you to sandbox what like in an otherwise simply too many things that have to define have to define every single style the list goes on and on the selector better so you just override your own just so that you can guarantee absolute control over your i realize that the latter solution necessarily be too if using the to reset everything to a found who has written up such a if you scroll down far enough on the see it it look but is a good start for would be interested to know if a good way to prevent written greasemonkey scripts before that injects code onto the and have had to write css to override the but in those cases i knew who my target was and could tailor my css directly towards the

 have the right you call your request gets queued on the main run so if the main thread is executing somewhere else at the time that processing will finished once your main thread code returns back to the run loop the request from the background thread can be looked at and know what determines the priority if there are other events queued for the run loop to process but in general i think you can rely on it even being the next thing is another reason you should try and keep your main thread sequential processing to a minimum try not to have long running sequences on the main thread but probably why using a background thread in the first

 have to be good at finding and fixing bugs when i program like i of i have to admit that the bug is when working with a group it is easy to blame someone else for a when i get that i start by collecting enough evidence to prove that the bug is about half the i collect enough evidence to determine that it is by that time well on my way to a otherwise i approach the other developer explaining what my code what the response and what surprises me about that that makes it easier for them to either point out where my expectations were wrong or where their contributions may not be working i do determine that the problem is i approach it with relentless application of i collect all of the information i can about the then i examine it and the code side by trying to figure out what could cause unexpected usually this points to some part of the code that becomes at that point i try to instrument the code saving copies of variables or logging critical based on the further information i evaluate and refine my original hypothesis and go several such iterations usually nail down the bug or point to a new area for i guess that boils down to analyze instrument test when i find the i always go through at least one more instrument test iteration to make sure the bug really is others have ask coworkers for that helps in two you will understand your code better when explaining it to even if your coworkers are not at your this can they may see things you did not notice or ask questions that did not

 having a small problem with request caching using nsurlconnection asynchronous connections on the i know if i understood something or if cocoa is doing the opposite to what supposed to documentation for nsurlrequest says that the data for the url load should be loaded from the originating no existing cache data should be used to satisfy a url load that not only should the local cache data be but that proxies and other intermediates should be instructed to disregard their caches so far as the protocol if i send an nsurlrequest with nsurlrequestreloadignoringlocalcachedata is supposed to ignore local but use remote cache if the headers that are sent basic the status is 200 but if i use which is supposed to ignore both local and remote as the name one additional header is the response is 304 not checked the http and for it says any of the entity tags match the entity tag of the entity that would have been returned in the response to a similar get request the on that then the server must not perform the requested method if the request method was get or the server should respond with a 304 it seems that if i use instead of ignoring the remote cocoa tells the remote server explicitly that it use remote and if i use it add that line and in effect the remote cache is not what exactly is happening did i miss or is cocoa setting a wrong nsurlrequest and remote

 having some trouble getting a indexing program to i have a form that automatically downloads urls to index from a database server and sends back responses containing the indexed page over i have a static class called udp that keeps track of incoming and outgoing there is an event that fires whenever a message is which the form that contains all the indexing code hooks to keep track of messages sent from a program on the server that holds the database of urls to was all working until i added another form that appears before the indexing the indexing form opens on another thread and a second the problem the event handler is no longer called when the event is the question what is going on and what can i do to fix pretty sure it has to do with some safety mechanism that call event handlers on another thread than the one the event was fired does anybody know of a different way to do this or a way to circumvent thanks in can i get an event handler to be called from a seperate thread than the one it was created

 header file is included in every translation unit in which there is an include directive for this is and will happen even with inclusion guards every translation unit that uses your struct needs to know how that struct is defined so that it can be laid out in memory the same way throughout all the translation units of your the inclusion guards just prevent it from being included multiple times one translation include files will be included in the order you include them within that translation unit be recursively included if include files include other as others have the order of translation units being compiled is up to you your to specify to the it matter what that order since every translation unit is completely independent until it gets to the linking phase of the build

 hope you mind me editing the subject of your question but i think that you be so worried about the vst part of your software and the nature of your question is more about driver development than vst you are essentially trying to write a normal midi but you actually need to connect to any so writing a virtual driver is really not as hard as you you just need to find the driver the edit to my answer on your previous more thing i should add is that the best way to accomplish what you are trying to use a separate application with so that is to you write an application which initializes a midi device when and connects to the sequencer via your users would start up the sequencer then your then send the audio on a bus track to your and configure their sequencer to receive midi from the device driver which you would the streams audio from does some type of fft to get the pitches whatever you want to do to the audio and then pushes those events out to the host through the midi driver probably the best way to solve this problem if i understand your project

 hunch here is probably this task will be easier to accomplish by writing a virtual midi device instead of a vst it is possible to send midi events to a sequencer using the but the problem is that the documentation never specifies how the is required to react to these many hosts simply ignore and i certainly think of one which allows easy routing from a plugin to a midi channel plogue might be able to accomplish this with audio units with the plugin though never written such a my impression was that this is what use to generate midi to the but the problem here is that not sure how the host would allow you to route audio to the plugin and accept midi from any your idea implemented as a plugin will be the most difficult to implement when you want to standardize its behavior for the most widely used i think that a far easier way to accomplish what you want is to create a virtual midi as thought of and then use rewire to route an input signal to your some resources on writing midi drivers for various device driver programming in os midi driver api

 i assume that by pl you mean presentation not persistence implementing a layered application the main question should always can i replace the implementation of a lower layer without impacting the implementation of the is usually best illustrated by the persistence if you switch from sql server 2008 to mysql for the persistence layer changes but are changes in the business layer also for does the business layer catch sqlexception instances that are only thrown by in a good the business layer needs no changes at same principle should apply to the separation between business layer and presentation your i would say that the should not be in the presentation it has nothing to do with the implementation of processing a request is not a concern for the presentation compare it with a web presenting a to a client is the concern of the web retrieving an instance of is the concern of a layer below the presentation whether to have a facade between your business layer and persistence layer is i usually do not implement a facade because it adds an extra layer of i do not see a problem in calling persistence layer methods directly from business layer if only you take the same principle into can you change the persistence layer implementation without affecting the business layer

 i had a very bitter experience with mq series partially due to the fact that it was pushed on to us microsoft by the partnering the use of mq series any messaging was an integral part to the we were building a process that handled supply chain fullfilment for backorder if our partner a distributor have the items their customers they would send a message into a b2b that would target potential companies that could fulfil the had built two different flavors of the first was an ftp approach where fixed width files were sent back and forth at regular and we had added all sorts of rules to help ensure we miss any second was using mq series where the messages were placed into a queue using guarenteed then we would pop the queue and process the the queing system was great benefit here as it allowed us a reliable way to transmit critical messages that resulted in real money being moved the flip side with the same mq series we had to implement a synchronous query to get we wanted it to be synchronous because our users accessing this via the web would wait to get the doing this over mq series was a very interesting and painful the only reason mq was used here was because it was an existing line of communication and the query functionality already second example and this time was using msmq was a site that collected information from dialhome code injected into client the dialhome code would collect feature usage statistics like sqm when the messages came in to the web service we would drop them on a then we could have any number of application servers popping the messages and pushing them to the database to be rolled into the here ensured we could handle bursts of messages by quickly placing them on the this help the scalability and reliability of the

 i just finished watching an episode of so try a differential diagnosis you know that it works with the thin driver from both but expiring in the jboss you say for sure very but it would appear that you have a jboss instance on compb and on and your code runs happily when it runs in the jboss instance on compb but core dumps from the i infer that when you run on talking to the oracle instance on have you tried running the code on compb but talking to have you tried running the code on but talking to the oracle on actual errors indicate a fault occurring in native code in a dynlib module and we know that you have different versions of the oracle stuff on compa and so my first suspicion would be that you have incompatible versions of on the two i observe that you have a different version of oracle on compa and i predict that the code on compb talking to oracle will and that the code on compc talking to compb will want to check the versions of the oracle oci driver software on compb and you can using oci and to both compa and compc connect using but can using to both compa and so it be a server you have this narrowed three connection methods and and three and the only one that fails is using oci from that fails talking to both compa and follows the problem is a configuration problem on compc still failing the since the same code works against compa and compb when running on it has to be a compc not a problem in your against the from compb and from confirm the rcp the compb onto compc and out what went wrong with

 i know this is a common question but there just seem to be any good answers for have a bucket with gobs have no clue how number of files in they are all within 2k a how do i figure out how many of these files i have used the and jets3t stuff and the best i can find is a command to count the first 1000 records performing gets on been using applet as well cause really nice to work with but even that i list all my objects cause i run out of heap cause it is peforming gets on all of them and keeping them in how can i just delete a the best thing seen is a paralleized delete loop and that has problems cause sometimes it tries to delete the same this is what all the commands that ran across do you guys do who have boasted about hosting millions of what happens when you want to remove are there alternate answers to all of these files are files so not even sure s3 is such a concern maybe i should move this to a document database of it boils down to is that the amazon s3 api is just straight out missing 2 very important operations count and there is a delete bucket command but it only works when the bucket is if someone comes up with a method that does not suck to do these two operations gladly give up lots of to answer a few the reason i ask this was i have been for the past year or so been storing hundreds of more like millions of 2k txt and xml the last a couple of months i wished to delete the bucket it literally took days to do so because the bucket has to be empty before you can delete this was such a pain in the ass i am fearing ever having to do this again without api support for rocks the a good couple gigs worth of files within you steve do i objects in a s3

 i the bounds rectangle actually is always the same size as the frame and has the origin relative to the frame rectangle coordinate for some reason the bounds rectangle appears to be smaller than the frame the content will be clipped while the frame rectangle uses larger space than what would if the bounds rectangle is bigger than the frame it valid to think about frame rectangle and bounds rectangle in the way of an html div container absolute positioned and has an and in css see any reason why it would make sense to have a bigger bound another problem raises up from the positioning of the bound relative to the frame rectangle coordinate so even if both have the same if the bounds rectangle is not positioned in the origin at do we have a big problem what it make sense that the bounds rectangle of an uiview can be bigger than the frame

 i think html and css are very and while the w3c certainly i think probably fair to say that a has been holding back design on the web more than the technologies has support for fantastic things such as web fonts with javascript engines are becoming increasingly speedy and allowing for things like john which would have been unimaginable years need to see users adopting new browsers at a faster and we need to see vendors getting behind efforts to encourage their users to think a mistake to think that abstractions are a negative and indicate some problem with the base technology technologies naturally evolve through some inconsistency in your post in the sense that you decry the need for but then mention that you desire consistency that consistency across clients is achieved through i no longer have to worry about how different clients handle the dom jquery does this for css hacks by the same token really and quite acceptable to serve a different stylesheet to the rendering difference between the other mainstream engines are pretty also consider that still using a lot of technologies to name a because they are elegant and well

 i want to run a query on one of my users where i want a row stored and associated with that in a so say is just an arbitrary that i have a table that keeps track of a along with some info about the each user can have either 0 or 1 if the user has no there is no entry in the table for that table just an when i update this i always end up doing something like this select from cars where update cars set where insert into cars values can i make this into one elegant statement that works what happens in another the row is removed between the select and update my update statement will fail where the insert statement should have and i feel like i need to do two similar statements to accomplish the same what i need is some statement that will assure me that the data i want exists in the especially when i only want 1 row that satisfies my for it might be something like is totally of sure a row in cars where is set with if of 5 exists it will be it will be if i changed the for example to say that each user can have zero or one cars of a given then i could further specify sure a row in cars where and is set with hope my question makes how can i improve this basic or operation that comes up so thanks for any way to insert a row if not or update it if it is

 i worked out where i was going the image scan data is saved in but the actual important info is encoded as variable length bit this means that the end of the actual image data does not necessarily fall on a byte when the jpeg encoder needs to pad out the number of bits to make the byte boundary it simply adds a series of the way the actual pixel info is stored is a little too complicated least for to but basically everything is encoded within minimal coding units or these vary in size depending on the chroma horizontal and vertical sizes being either 8 or 16 for each there are dc and ac parts that make up a single component of or cb and the problem was that the dc components are stored as values in relation to the relevant dc value of the previous so when i added the new image data from jpg it had stored its dc values in relation to 0 there were no previous but it needed to take into account the final dc values of the last mcu from jpg that makes need to do an initial decode of the image data to find out exactly where the image data ends and then strip the trailing you also need to change the initial dc values in the second jpg you then need to reencode the appropriate add 1s to fit to a byte et you want to append in the its a little more you have to rearrange the mcus so that they scan in the right jpgs scan from left to then top to bottom and then adjust the dc values far only tested this on single mcu but theoretically it should work with bigger ones i only worked this out thanks to the owner of this jpg related	
 i worked with struts2 in a pretty certain it supports multiple ajax i presume you looked at various ajax the options in struts 2 on what you want to ajax tags although i used i believe would be similar to the ajax also the dojo which again provided server side tags to bind to dojo but just noticed that its been you are doing more had good success with the json which lets you send json to the server have it deserialised bound directly to your actions then serialise your results back to json for the this allows you to use jquery your javascript library of and talk to the server in both directions using json makes for a very clean simple solution as the end result allows you to effectively use your business directly in your javascript	
 i would check to see if the context returned from your call is valid make sure also check to make sure your originally loaded image is valid make sure your context is it may be because your image size is or else your pixel data format is try using you need to use you can just use the pointer you passed in in the first you should also your context before leaving your function to avoid a also note that using this means that the alpha component is not in your so you want an offset of 0 for the alpha component in your any of that

 idea complicates things but my thought would be to create one viewer per message and create only as many viewers as are necessary to display the currently visible i think the virtualizingstackpanel control would be a good tool to manage i found a series describing the implementation of a virtualizingstackpanel this implies maintaining the message buffer in a separate data i just realized that the standard listbox control uses a virtualizingstackpanel in its with this in my revised suggestion a data structure to contain the source of each a property on the data structure that creates a flowdocument from the message source the a listbox to a collection of said data the itemtemplate for the listbox with a flowdocumentscrollviewer where the document property is bound to the aforementioned data regarding i help you much with printing in wpf involving but zooming should be pretty easy to i created a zoomlistbox to test this the xaml looks like the code behind is partial class public public double get return set using a dependencyproperty as the backing store for this enables public static readonly dependencyproperty zoomproperty new an example of using

 if it applies to a table it applies to a in 12 years of doing i have yet to see a query sped up by explicitly naming columns instead of using production i use but for reasons of making code mean what it not and because order can matter when binding to a result set production use if the intent of the view i mean to is in all that recompiling a view will pick up table order matter in a only in the query that may the let me note that a view definition is parsed once it is when the view is not when it is so the tiny amount of time to get from to happens at the time the is sent to the db bringing back all the columns the will be slower than bringing back only one usually not by but a different

 if overriding you want to override the reason for this is because both are used to compare equality of your is used when checking we know the pointer likely to we can compare the internal if return mytype foo o as if return if return return is generally used by hash the hashcode generated by your class should always be the same for a classes give typically int hashcode hashcode return will say that the hashcode should only be calculated once per object but i agree with that probably the default implementation provided by unless you have the same reference to one of your they will not be equal to each by overriding equals and you can report equality based on internal values rather than the objects

 implementation of ruby and jruby have quite different threading implementations so it may be impossible to have the answer for your but it appears that you might be trying to write fast concurrent code in my experiences with ruby is that this a reasonable ruby may be but still has a global interpreter lock like you are writing ruby code where you are considering these sort of potentially unsafe optimizations to wring out some extra you should probably consider using another idiomatic ruby tends to emphasize readability and expressiveness before efficiency and trying to wring speed increases and increased reliability out of the mri has been an exercise in frustration for been working on a ruby project for awhile that has just entered the phase where we are seriously looking at running the project in jruby and replacing the bottlenecks implemented in ruby with java libraries resulted in a pretty remarkable increase in speed and reliability with relatively little effort on our is not but its java integration has proven to be helpful and if it is impossible to use jruby for your or you are comfortable with c but not and sure you can write safe c without memory writing a c extensions to ruby or may be the best apologize if this question was completely academic in perhaps if you could let us know trying to

 impossible to not knowing the size of and the call to it will preallocate the buffer just once given the length of the format string and the strings that will be inserted and then concatenate everything and insert it into the for very large this will be advantageous over separate calls to which might cause the buffer to expand multiple the three calls to might or might not trigger growth of the buffer and that check is performed each if the strings are small enough and no buffer expansion is then it will be faster than the call to because it have to parse the format string to figure out where to do the data is needed for a definitive should be noted that there is little discussion of using the static method on the using reminded me of his test results show that to be the best case you have to take advantage of specific format does the same thing in that it will predetermine the length of the strings to concatenate and preallocate the buffer slightly more overhead due to looping constructs through the performance is going to be comparable to just the plain addition since it compiles to a call to with the caveat that all of the additions are in the same one call to result a b two calls to result a result all those putting up test need to run your test cases in runs at the perform a gc between the measuring of separate test the reason for this is that if you do creating a new in each iteration of the loop for one and then you run the next test that loops the same number of creating an the gc will more than likely step in during the second test and hinder its

 in java are pretty the fundamental problem sounds as if your original are already too small so scaling them up leaves you with a real simple approach is to have the images sent along with the app to be at the larger size and only scale i would say a policy on images sizes height and is necessary as you seem to indicate that only some have course if you can go for vector you can scale infinitely and this may be a better long term investments depending upon your application and the likely hood of needing to support large output formats just screens but it may well be fairly complex to approach things this information would be needed to help you further with the points in this	
 in java facilitate by means of type you can pass arguments to just as a method like models some not just for a particular but for any string so a type like models some not just for a specific but any says that any type there exists a of so is a actually a it takes a type as an argument and constructs another type as a are a couple of examples of generic types i use every a very useful generic interface public b interface says that any two and a function that takes an and returns a when you implement this and can be any types you as long as you provide a function that takes the former and returns the an example implementation of the inttostring new public string return polymorphism was achieved by using the with we can actually do away with subclassing and use parametric polymorphism for consider a parameterised class used to calculate hash codes for any instead of overriding we would use a generic class like final class private final public public int return is much more flexible than using because we can stay with the theme of using composition and parametric polymorphism without locking down brittle generics are not perfect you can abstract over but you abstract over type for that you can say any type but you say any type t that takes a type parameter wrote an article about these limits of java source for a lot of useful generic types can be found also check out the source for the standard java if you

 is a complex piece of software that is annoying to launch by what done is to create a python script to launch the executable and attach for process launching an environment variable is a local build directory gets added to the the current working directory to where the executable expects to be my the executable with a config file the only command line option the output from the executable to a second logging pid of then launches attaches gdb to running script with one interrupt the debugee and return control to so if i with no active breakpoints i can never stop the process it has to be from another running sigint where is the pid does get me back to but it is really annoying to have to do things this first i thought python was grabbing the sigint but this seem to be the case as i set up signal handlers forward the signal to the debugee and that fix the tried various configurations to the python script instead of it seems that any way i go about if python launched the child sigint signals do not to get routed to gdb or the child line of might be related to needing process group id for the debugee credence to bug with present with python as environment delivering signals to up a file to do as much of what the script environment variables and current working directory are a problem with this executable and attaching gdb manually do you automate the of large scale tried nicholas examples on my macintosh at home they all allow to work to varrying on the production boxen i now to believe may be running they do you automate the of large scale	
 is a complex there are infinitely many ways to interpolate a set of and this assuming that you truly do wish to do and not smoothing of any interpolant reproduces the original data points and of the nature of this problem makes things more are several common schemes for interpolation of scattered data in for those who have access to a very nice paper is available data tests of some mathematics of the most common method used is based on a triangulation of your merely build a triangulation of the domain from your data then any point inside the convex hull of the data must lie inside exactly one of the or it will be on a shared this allows you to interpolate linearly inside the if you are using then the function griddata is available for this express problem when trying to populate a complete rectangular image from scattered points is that very likely the data does not extend to the 4 corners of the in that a triangulation based scheme will since the corners of the array do not lie inside the convex hull of the scattered an alternative then is to use basis abbreviated there are many such schemes to be including when used by the geostatistics inpainting is the name for a scheme of interpolation where elements are given in an but where there are missing the name obviously refers to that done by an art conservator who needs to repair a tear or rip in a valuable piece of idea behind inpainting is typically to formulate a boundary value that define a partial differential equation on the region where there is a using the known boundary fill in the hole by solving the pde for the unknown this can be computationally intensive if there are a huge number of unknown since it typically requires the solution of at least a massive sparse system of linear if the pde is a nonlinear then it becomes a more intensive problem a reasonably good choice for the pde is the which results in a linear system that extrapolates i can offer a solution for a matlab choices for the pde may come from nonlinear once such is the it is well suited to modeling the types of surfaces typically but it is also more difficult to deal as in many facets of you get what you pay

 is a found nothing interesting over the developing a memory management module for my we develop games for consoles ps3 and we consider pc a need in for our next to handle texture streaming for large game worlds that cannot be loaded all in main console memory talking about pc for are going to stream at the beginning mipmaps of textures is about of the size of world maybe in the future have to stream also smaller developing a memory manager for that focused on x360 over ps3 we can use host memory and the gmm problem facing is the we have decided to reserve a specific memory area for texture streaming example 64 and we want to handle all allocations and deallocations in that we have allocated the area at the beginning of the application and the area is physically guaranteed to be contiguous just cause we need to store textures implemented an auto defragmenting using handles instead of time is not an the problem is memory in game we continuously load and unload streaming so like to use the maximum amount of our buffer this allocator we can use all of the allocated space but the defragmentation routine works in an unaccettable time 60 more than a while the algorithm is not too there are just too meny unevitable looking for a solution to solve this like to find at least a good or a or someone who have faced the same problem of choosing between two move the defragmentation routine on a dedicated thread for x360 with 6 hw bad for ps3 with just a hw and tell me to use with all multithreading problems of locking of accessing a region who is being find an solution to defragmentation we can give each frame a time budget example up to 1 for defragmentation and the memory manager will do what it can do in the budget each someone tell me his experience memory management for texture streaming in

 is actually two questions rolled into there a particular type of java functionality that people are using jruby for or is it mainly because of the performance advantage that jruby gives versus the reason i ask like to add some java functionality to a rails project to show that ideally this java functionality would also be useful rather than which leads to my next question an example of something that would make a good demonstration of java functionality being added to a simple rails crud guess anything you can do in a ruby you could just as easily do in a java class about twice as much so i understand the question may be hard to just wondering if there is a particular type of functionality that is more appropriate to do in nothing at stake by the just playing around and testing things an example of java functionality that i could add to a

 is and afraid i offer a good solution to your current situation but brian has given the answer on how to avoid avoidance comes down to a little bit of repository theory basically it must not be possible to modify any source code for your project without a corresponding revision appearing in pointing all externals to tags or specific no changes from them can appear in the main project history without committing a change to the external but if you point an external to a moving a change to the external will not show up in the main timeline at all leaving you in the position taken the view that externals should be treated and released as independent hence all externals point to during heavy parallel fine to an external to or to have an unstable development branch temporarily pointing to an external but the mainline project trunk always points to a stable and a conscious decision to this view may be overkill for your but worth seeing other

 is detailed of why is both more efficient and less biased than from the sun forums post that gili linked uses uses twice to generate a double that has approximately uniformly distributed bits in its so it is uniformly distributed in the range 0 to uses less than twice on it uses it and if the value obtained is above the highest multiple of n below it tries otherwise is returns the value modulo n prevents the values above the highest multiple of n below skewing the so returning a value which is uniformly distributed in the range 0 to to scaling by the output of is one of possible values drawn from a uniform by 6 alter the number of possible and casting to an int then forces these values into one of six each bucket corresponding to ranges encompassing either 1501199875790165 or 1501199875790166 of the possible values 6 is not a disvisor of this means that for a sufficient number of dice rolls a die with a sufficiently large number of the die will show itself to be biased towards the larger will be waiting a very long time rolling dice for this effect to show also requires about twice the processing and is subject to

 is not directly an answer to your but i have some experience using random access for blobs in and i advise you against using if you break the sql query format if your blob data needs any kind of it will certainly at some point need whatever mechanism you have in place to deal with filtering in sql will be useless in this with binary blobs wrapped in databases opposed to binary data in raw files limits your you will not be able to randomly read and write to data at the same time from multiple which is possible with you use any tool that deals with this data and provides only a file you truncate or resize the files are simply a lot more may seem convenient to have everything contained within one as it simplifies backup and but the pain of working with blobs is simply not worth as your i advise you to write your blobs as raw files to the file and merely store a reference to the filename in your if your blobs are rather small and guaranteed not to forget my	
 is not exactly a technical since i know c kind of enough to do the things i need to in terms of not the language get in your so this question is basically a direction to i am currently taking an advanced algorithms and for the sake of up as i am required to use pure c to implement the practical assignments works pretty much any small mistake you make actually forces you to understand completely what doing in order to fix in the course of i obviously run into the problem of having to implement the data structures from the ground actually not only linked but also et am focusing on lists in this topic because typically a structure i end up using a lot in the either as a structure or as a structure for other bigger ones a hash tree that resolves conflicts by using a linked requires that the list stores elements of lots of different i am assuming here as a premise that i want to the list for every i can come up with these a list of void pointers harder to only one but having a as containing all element types i will use in the program to wastes space if elements are not all the same a preprocessor macro to regenerate the code for every in the style of stl waste elements have the explicit type they actually are when they are change in list code can be really make the question which one of the above is since i am basically in an academic i am also very interested in the view of people working with pure c out there in the i understand that most pure c programmers are in the embedded devices where i think this kind of problem i am facing is if anyone out there knows how done the real i would be very interested in your linked list implementation in pure

 is nothing special about c and other is a remarkably unambitious its goal more or less to create a portable assembly anything more advanced than has no place in the as there is to learn from in no way a difficult but it requires a lot of work to achieve even the simplest and it is of course very and unsafe compared to higher level is a remarkably complicated it has had a lot of different influences over the and has stolen ideas from a wide range of languages and programming and then in the last decade or this has been topped off by the community pretty much inventing their own paradigm as has come up with some pretty clever solutions to a lot of common all as much as people like to look down on i frequently miss it when working in there are a number of techniques and abstractions that are cleaner and more elegant in so from a pure language i think is worth i wish javas or designers had bothered to do rather than basing their languages on what can be more accurately described as with i think what getting at is that learning these languages will give you a better understanding of going on under the can see the point in gives you pointers which can be mapped directly to the underlying memory learning these languages certainly gives you a kind of intuition about going on as always with not always one of the most common mistakes in is to assume that are memory in many ways they behave but pointers obey a lot of additional constraints that may or may not exist in the actual for these why not go directly to the learn learn about the cpu learn about of the above is worth and will make you a better but learn for the sake of the language not but there are lessons to be learned from and learn about all the underlying mechanics the hardware running the by studying those whatever you go definitely you should learn the languages you actually work but stop learn almost regardless of what it more or a better understanding of the underlying all make you a better think of as the in particular may be one of the hardest languages to but that mean those who know it are the best far from

 is the correct way to represent a value such the dom level 2 call is the null value is is also used to indicate a valid element with no content even if that elements content type normally allow empty an empty tag is returns the empty string the tag is then no author tag is even this may be semantically different than setting it to setting to nil may be that the book belongs to no while omitting series could mean that series is an inapplicable element to the current structures introduces mechanism for signaling that element should be accepted as when it has no content despite content type which does not require even necessarily allow empty an element may be content if it has the with the value element so labeled must be can carry attributes if permitted the corresponding complex you have a book xml element and one of the child elements is you have several options when filling it the element entirely this can be done when you wish to indicate that series does not apply to this book or that book is not part of a in this case xsl transforms other event based that have a template that matches will never be for if your xsl turns the book element into table row you may get the incorrect number of table cells using this the element empty this could indicate that the series is or is or that the book is not part of a any xsl transform other evernt based that matches will be the value of will be you will get the same number of tags using this method as with the next described this signifies that the element is not just your xsl transform other event based that have a template matching will be the value of will be empty empty the main difference between this method and is that the schema type of does not need to allow the empty string as a valid this makes no real sense for a series but for a language element that is defined as an enumerated type in the allows the element to have no another example would be elements of type if you want them to be empty you can union an enumerated string that only allows and a or use a decimal that is

 is the easy you could just let iis handle authentication thru digest or your app can still make authorization ntlm is but hurt your ad does offer some digest authentication but i have tested code using server 2000 an option for passwords in reversible that will allow a domain controller to calculate md5 hashes of the password to compare against your presented md5 ms realized this was a bit of a security so server 2003 implemented digest authentication which precomputes the signon should select md5 digest as the authentication supply the and then supply the md5 hash of the the normal ldap clients will probably want to md5 your password themselves so have to override or craft them

 is to race to really ensure uniqueness requires additional one suggestion from the activerecord rdocs is to create a unique index on the for example by including in your will ensure at the database level that the name is but a disadvantage to this approach is that the exception returned on attempting to save a duplicate is not very one cannot be sure when catching this exception that the error was generated by a duplicate record and not just by broken as the rdocs is to parse the message that comes with the exception and try to detect words like or but this is kludgy and the message is database backend for my understanding is that the message is totally generic and cannot be parsed this way at that this is a fundamental problem for activerecord it would be nice to know if there is any standard approach to handling these i will offer my suggestion please comment or provide can i determine if my activerecord object violates a unique database

 is when the existence of a row in a child table depends on a row in a parent this may be confusing because common practice these days to create a pseudokey for a child but make the foreign key to the parent part of the primary the way to do this is to make the foreign key part of the primary but the logical relationship is that the child cannot exist without the a has one or more phone if they had just one phone we could simply store it in a column of since we want to support multiple phone we make a second table whose primary key includes the referencing the may think of the phone as belonging to a even though they are modeled as attributes of a separate this is a strong clue that this is an identifying relationship if we literally include in the primary key of is when the primary key attributes of the parent become primary key attributes of the a good example of this is a lookup such as a foreign key on referencing the primary key of is a child table with respect to but a row in is not identified by its is not part of the primary key of relationship can be or which means the foreign key column allows null or disallows also my answer to confused about identifying

 jalf suggests in the you probably want to use a variant of the recurring template that make a class template parametrised by the derived myhashingsolution typedef d void int void just for return this because you want the derived class to also be a you need to take the slightly unusual step of declaring as a class template that takes a template class state public void int requires int return key point is provided inherits from is a derived class of so the downcast in compiles and works you mess up and derive from instead and then try something that involves a call to the compiler will complain as the requirements for are not declare the concrete class you want to use like this solution has the side effect that you will need to change any other such to templates that ignore their one template in order to make them usable as template template

 java but is relevant to most other technologies as not sure whether confused the use of a plain singleton with a both of them are design the service locator pattern is used by applications to ensure that there is a single class entrusted with the responsibility of obtaining and providing access to jms service locators are implemented as since there is no need for multiple service locators to do the same it is useful to cache information obtained from the first lookup that can be later used by other clients of the service the the argument about to ensure that there is only one active connection to your false and it is quite possible that the connection can be if left inactive for quite a long period of so caching a connection to the database is frowned there is one deviation from this the connection obtained from the connection pool is encouraged as long as you do so with the same within the same http or user request is this done from the point of view of since establishing new connections can prove to be an expensive

 jon much of this assumes the risk of seeming comments like these just bother to write programs correctly is difficult and time should be avoided is practically impossible to write software that does anything significant without leveraging threads in some if you are on open your task enable the thread count and you can probably count on one hand the number of processes that are using a single one should not simply use threads for the sake of using threads nor should it be done but i believe these cliches are used too i had to boil multithreaded programming down for the true i would say jumping into first understand that the the class boundary is not the same as a thread for if a callback method on your class is called by another thread the asynccallback delegate to the understand that the callback executes that other so even though the callback occurs on the same you still have to synchronize access to the members of the object within the callback threads and classes are it is important to understand this what data needs to be shared between once you have defined the shared try to consolidate it into a single class if the places where the shared data can be written and if you can get this down to one place for writing and one place for you will be doing yourself a tremendous this is not always but it is a nice goal to shoot make sure you synchronize access to the shared data using the monitor class or the lock use a single object to synchronize your shared data regardless of how many different shared fields there this will simplify it may also overly constrain things in which you may need a synchronization object for each shared and at this using immutable classes becomes you have one thread that needs to signal another i would strongly recommend using the manualresetevent class to do this instead of using sum i would say that threading is not but it can be a properly threaded application will be more and your users will be most is nothing about asynchronous the various method in if these techniques make it easier to accomplish various tasks in a threaded if you have a gui application that does any heavy or it is practically impossible to make the responsive to the user without leveraging threads behind the the techniques i mentioned above make this possible and are a breeze to it is important to understand the to be i simply believe we do especially younger a disservice when we talk about how multithreaded programming is or how threads be comments like these oversimplify the problem and exaggerate the myth when the truth is that threading has never been there are legitimate reasons to use and cliches like this just seem counterproductive to

 just sudo like you need to setup passwordless sudo first in this can be done with visudo command for make sure you set up privileges in sudoers file in such way to constrain the apache user to that single command you wish to run your shell it poses a security because anyone could create a php script and run your shell script in so make sure that shell script itself is secure from alteration by apache second is even more you just allow apache to run killall with root you should wrap killall in another shell script and grant access to that in the do not run apache with root account and do not use both open a can of and since you are a newbie the question you you are very likely to miss some of small details that would create potential

 just written a simple web service that displays a web form containing a single type upload field and a single submit i made this simple web page with the intent that a human could use it and also that a script on a different machine could also execute it i got the human part all done and tested and now i just realized that i have no idea how to construct a url on the second machine that successfully executes this cgi script on the first machine gets a file uploaded from the second machine to the first do have some experience constructing urls that contain form but have never used the type upload input field so struggling with it a maybe using it my simple web service is a script called and if the file upload field is called and if the file on the second machine that i want to upload programatically is located in then i be able to just construct a url in a script on the second machine of the form and that file gets uploaded programatically just as if a human had clicked on the browse button on the web form manually and chose that file and clicked on the submit works fine manually when i bring up the cgi script form on the first machine and browse to the file and click the file seems to get uploaded by the web browser just but when i type in the above url into my browser to test out the file upload url manually before i program that url into a script on another the file that gets uploaded is a zero length it creates a file but completely same results if i use a known bad filename like what am i doing trying to accomplish this task on a couple of windows xp pcs with apache and activeperl and the form method is to programatically execute a cgi script form that contains a type upload input	
 jython is not a suitable replacement for for that it provides no way to implement interfaces without writing the interface in java and then writing a class leveraging it in needed is a equivalent to boo is a language targeting the clr which is roughly inspired by python but not and which fully exposes the functionality being with there presently is no pythonic language with feature parity with java and such a language would necessarily be incompatible with as python simply provide a way to express some of the relevant concepts as interface typing there have been some questions about yet me is not a replacement for java in the sense that you take an arbitrary java decide to implement a random subset of that project in jython and not have anyone else on the development team know or jython is suitable for many of the same classes of projects that java when building an interface which will be called from rather than the given as tend to have a lot of components which operate closely with each being able to build a class with an arbitrary external interface is and is something which readily done in pure

 kind of client are we talking windows client or there are two very general patterns for you can either push or pull the pushing work if your on the internet run into firewalls and so you end up with a third variation where the client initates the and the server leaves the connection open to send information back and need to provide a lot more are we talking about internet or what framework are you how many clients are you a solution that can handle a dozen clients in a push model or the third could look very different from a solution which can scale to thousands of easiest solution is to do polling from the client which unless you want the server to have instant communication to the client is the way to and a heart beat is not instant you indicated are you really sure you want to do lower level network type why not build upon existing network strategies such as you can do a simple remoting service over http which will let you bypass or even better if your server is a web server then just setup a plain old xml have any examples i can share of but there should be plenty

 kinda have to put my previous c questions on hold cause this one is more important have already coded the insert and delete functions on my binary search tree but the delete function is a couple of things i need help is my insert function good or can it be improved my delete function lacks the deletion of a node with both the left and right searched a lot in the past few hours but find a proper way to do how should i delete a node with 2 child as in the first is the delete function good or can it be this one i know it can because repeating lots of code in those ifs but i see how can i improve i need help on that struct sclientprofile struct sclienttree struct sclientprofile char int int struct sclienttree clientprofile char clienttree clienttree clientprofile clienttree new else else char int ncompare else else clienttree cliptr cliptr else clienttree cliptr else clienttree cliptr else missing delete probably notice but let me just make 2 tree uses strings instead of the normal int why i use all the i think using it not using i rather pass the pointer a structure pointer in this and work with it looks more clean somehow and in the future i want to return a success value if a node was already did my iterative version of the delete function but i like some things about maybe they can be improved but i see also tried to code the case it was deleting a node with 2 but not working as it commented the whole code where i think the code can be improved and the also named those problems as b no b c and d so we can reference to them char return clienttree currptr clienttree prevptr int ncompare prevptr currptr else prevptr currptr else the following cases have 3 lines in the calls and return is there anyway to this code and make it more of the are to be return else else return else clienttree tempptr tempptr this has a big if you take a look at the clientprofile in the first see two and one the problem is that the following code line is copying the integer not the for the string remains the old i tried to use directly on clientname but it still why everything is being copied but the is there anyway to not call the function and make the while loop once again and delete corresponding return return to properly in a binary search tree in

 know how to to use the default platform ui they know what they look how they and the platform ones work really know how to use your and even if you try and copy the platform one except for your widget will behave as a cheap it will be missing features the user your scroll thumb to show the length of the with a minimum size such that its always but only on platforms where that is scroll to the position scroll down and scroll up and each in proportion to where clicked on the scrollbar on the platform where this is clicking in the blank space between the thumb and up or down arrow does it scroll by the amount the user is which varies by scrolling go at the speed the user expects when the scroll buttons are held is the user dragging the thumb handled when the mouse goes outside the or on the your custom scroll bar follow the visual theme the user selected because he needs widgets due to answer to most of those is probably at been my experience with web sites where the designer decided the platform scroll bars cute

 know kinda subjective if you were to put yourself in my shoes would you invest the time in want to write a web app which deals securely with relatively modest amounts of peoples private a few thousand records of a few kb each but stuff that needs to be kept phone numbers done several web projects in and have handy though it is i really like php and want to do another large project in such i figure best learn something new and so i am considering 2 options happily entertain others if you have having terrible trouble deciding they both look quite involved so rather than just jump in and potentially waste days getting up to speed enough on both of them to make an informed choice i thought come here and canvas some the two options considering of the python web turbogears seems well of all the languages i ever tried python is by far and away my loads of frameworks to choose from and i have done quite a lot of non web python coding over the last few loads to choose from so hard to need to run single server or which i like the sound what i do like is the notion of process separation and if one users account is compromised it gives an attacker no leverage against the rest of the not clear to what extent a python solution would handle it as a seaside which i guess runs on a squeak app from what heard it would permit good compartmentalization of users as each would have their own little private vm independent of all the systems other users which sounds wonderful from a scaling and redundancy not done any smalltalk since uni 15 years back and i never dug too deep into it i see much entry level help for seaside or that many projects using i suspect setting a server up to run it is hard for the same reason not because inherently hard but just cause there will be less help online and a presumption you are already rather au fait with what do people would i be able to efficiently get the kind of strong separation and compartmentalization after with a python is seaside as good as i think in terms of insulating users from each might i be better security sticking to the languages most familiar with so i make any n00b mistakes or will seaside be worth worth scaling the learning curve and prove more comprehensible and maintainable in the long at the end of the day not a life or death decision and i can always bail if i start with one and then hate it so pls nobody get all holy language war and start flaming for any replies this should i learn seaside or a python

 know that the codeproject detection mechanism is all that if nothing else you wrap up that code into a method to make an initial stab at when a better detection method comes along you change the implementation to that but i understand the issue in that you are only guaranteed to know that there are at least 2 this of course depending on the threading you want to do is less performant on great other yuck thing to do is to allow the user to adjust the number of threads they want run in your app like 7zip if you detect you could then expose a spin control to let the user decide how many threads they clunkier than an but at least in the case of cores you have the hope that the code runs more

 like you hit on a hot as a designer i think the best way to improve your ability in that regard is to look at a lot of good actively seek them pixeline not a lot of objective knowledge to be learned there is more about improving your aesthetic if you look at high quality designs all the then your tastes will become more refined and your web designs will naturally conform to your acclimated i work at an indie metal so from time to time called upon to work on band album magazine so always flipping through metal magazines and looking at ads designed by other or admiring the merch designs of other or checking out the sites of other not only serves as a source of inspiration when helps me to gauge my own abilities and find areas for but it also helps me track the trends and fashions in my particular sphere of as we all fashion is and tastes are always a good designer knows how to stay just ahead of the curve all the this means that your designs deviate too drastically from accepted aesthetics your designs will be rejected by but you also want to employ design elements that are overused and played you can ride the edge and innovate enough to stand but not so much that the audience is unable to accept then you will have mastered the art of web a good designer can identify emerging trends and capitalize on while making it their own by adding their own twist to just starting to venture into be afraid to emulate others and steal good and give credit where credit is but just as making copies of famous is an essential training technique in figure drawing so too is emulating quality designs an effective tool in learning graphic like web and are excellent places to immerse oneself in quality designs and i would highly recommend scanning through these sites in your free time to flood your mind with examples of good i also want to emphasize that talent is not as much of a factor as most people would more is what people confuse as if you truly have an interest in you will be motivated to immerse yourself in it and practice this in turn leads to better and if started at a young age builds which leads to an ability which leads to more confidence and more which in turn leads to more consider myself a decent graphic designer can check out my portfolio via my profile and an alright and people often comment on how talented i but they realize that i have literally spent thousands of hours honing my while other kids were out playing with their i was in my room the only reason i excelled in and when i first started building they looked just as hideous as most myspace so get discouraged when you see the work of they all started from humble beginnings as

 looking at improving the performance of page load and render time of a rather complex to the use of a lot of controls that themselves include javascript files simply using the certain pages load the same javascript up to 10 some javascript must be loaded early in the while others is better included at the some i would like to dynamically load after the onload event instead of explicitly include in the way thinking about is to let all the different controls register their need of a particular javascript file in a central place that in turn controls the generation of avoiding and where they are inserted into the generated this would also make it easy to dynamically switch between minified and full javascript files appending to the query string would make files load by instead of this solution it would also be possible for it to basically generate a javascript array of filenames that are used by a custom onload javascript function to dynamically load the is the best way to accomplish use or extend something like make a custom override the page to best control loading of multiple javascript files in

 main difference when it comes to oop and programming is that you would like your new thread to have as its function a method of an there are a few programming models for implement a interface is the most common used your class implements a standard interface that has a method which is usually a virtual method called you put your code in that virtual method and when you need to spawn a thread you create a thread object called and you pass to it an object of your class that implements the then you call the method of that object and that will take care that the code you have written in your class will be run a a new in this example both and are provided by the chosen threading library or by the standard of the programming language of your also please note that the names of these two classes can is a big difference between and java when it comes to has not support for as opposed to java which has support for for you will need to use a specialized threading library such as pthreads or more general purpose libraries such as poco which already have support for the least recommended way is to call directly the related services of the no matter what edition you are using you will already have the support for programming

 make sense to talk about variables in because nothing analogous to a declaration in the languages designed for compilers have declarations because the compiler needs to know in advance how big datatypes are and how to access different parts of if i say in the compiler knows that somewhere there is some memory set aside for and as big as it needs to be to hold a pointer to an eventually the linker will hook all the references to but at least the compiler knows out there typically set an initial value for something least in the familiar compiled if exist before the then i guess you could call this a since that is when ruby has to assign a value to the symbol is a specific term that people typically use to distinguish the static assignment of a value to some variable from that in you have that kind of you typically just say a variable is if been assigned a value somewhere in your current and you say if it usually talk about it having a because in ruby that just amounts to no special context that would justify you saying like there is in other brings us can definitely call this an since it is assigning a value to the symbol i think anyone will disagree with

 methods are not code i think the opposite a lack of private methods to that there is some good opportunity for refactoring in a other thought for many of your private methods have no dependency on class you can make them static private many tools such as resharper suggest this by since it makes it obvious that they have no dependency on the data in the and enforces that by the can help you understand which of the methods are touching your class and using data at some mean that there are more likely synchronization issues if

 minor point about function declaration keywords in if got a class method should the keyword come before or after the visibility keyword assuming all your static or have a visibility then want the visibility keyword to remain in the same place relative to the function function function function pretend a couple are function public function function private function if a method is you want that to be the thing because that has more of an impact on what kind of method it is than even the visibility keyword is strictly a readability as it obviously has no functional or design i can think or

 miss having overloaded operators in especially in the following class that is an algorithm or a chain of the natural thing is to overload every programmer comes up with incompatible and thus names for so clarity is because these names forced to use make their meaning class that has a conversion to another in operator and works both for actual conversion and for yielding an internal member of the desired the second case comes up a lot in java when a class is unnecessarily final but you want to add operations to decoratedstringbuffer stringbuffer as string is private string public string final string public string other forwarding decoratedstringbuffer before it leaves your code and returns to the client it needs to be converted presumably by a function that finally applies the suffix and it would be great if we could call that operator even greater if like could apply one because no we have to give it a name that is necessarily more is one obvious but to many java imply a corresponding which we even if it imply the is the stringbuffer getting the one we operate or something is a better and the pattern i tend to but then someone reading the code wonders why what looks like a getter is called except in designing numerical classes or cocatenatable little use for overloading and as java like not much use for java trying to make everything act like a primitive int value and the conversion operators i

 my experience there are only two kinds of error those specific to the application developing and those generated by an api your application depends first type you will almost always need to write the second type depends on whether you want to show it to the some are worded simply enough you can just pass it along to the user but in most cases the error messages produced by an api are intended for developers and would only confuse an end instance most operating systems have a not error message or something assuming the file you attempting to open was chosen by the user it makes sense to pass this error from the os directly to the while a by error would not help the user unless you application performs calculations directly entered by the for most circumstances this error would mean a programming application specific the error message is only useful within the context of where it this is why you find a collection of generic error generic error messages usually give the user enough information to know how to	
 my first year as a cs i took a java course in fall which was the general the professor teach pointers but he did teach the concept of and why you can modify objects and not when primitives when either is passed in an my 2nd i took the next course in the which was about and this class heavily relied on an intro to programming say just mention but not pointers	
 my google maps application i can place markers on the and i keep a reference to each of the markers along with some extra information in an array called markers is i just the newly created object onto the array when it comes to removing an arbitrary marker from the given an index of the it behave as my function if if you really want to remove this marker from the marker have no previous experience with the but looking at description it seems to be pretty i get the following does so what am i doing when is 0 no confirmation box is at first i assumed the lengthy evaluated to false and so the whole code block was using firebug to step through the calls i found out that the condition holds for index 0 when array is next step reveals that the and are and is called nothing this behaviour is so strange i decided to open this anyone please clarify going thought that deleting markers will be the easiest bit of functionality one could i can add edit their even all markers off the array until and all works an arbitrary element from a javascript

 my internship on interfacing i need to generate some very fast flickering squares on a crt monitor alternating between two the refresh rate is 85hz and we would like this to be the which means that repainting all squares can take at most language of preference for programming is so i tried making a prototype with because synchronous i now seem to have two the first is that time measurements show that the repainting of even 9 squares simply takes too my algorithm takes the desired frequency and calculates the times at which the system should repaint in advance and then uses a loop no that checks everytime if the next was reached and if loops through all the squares to repaint the way i implemented it now is that the squares are panels with background color a and are contained in another panel with background color b and the flickering happens because the visibility is i figured that this would be faster than one panel that has to draw rectangles all the have a decent profiling tool get eclipse tptp or netbeans profiler to so i be but i have the feeling that the bottleneck is actually not in the but in the looping conditional checking can you recommend anything about what i should second problem is that it seems like the squares are rendered like they unroll really but still this is what wondering is what causes is it or or just me writing a slow you recommend some things for me to i prefer to use but i will use c if i in this are there any for this sort of 2d programming that you can to generate simple 2d graphics in real

 my point of view you are in the wrong way to do what you will read token stopping each time it reads the finding the token it will discard it as it begins with next iteration in its loop it will handle token one on the then the next it reads the next one which is please note the end of line character in the middle of the the i am not sure it is what you the behavior you want is your program to skip commented lines with a better read a whole line instead with in a first do not specify any character as the third parameter when calling must be taken as the delimiter to get the this first add a first check to see whether a character begins the if so call the continue otherwise enter in a second nested loop to interpret all tokens in your this time using method to find the loop until you read the whole could either considering boost tokeniser while never used it a very long time ago when i was i remember it was quite appropriated to do that kind of job in a very simple believe there are also good libs to read a file and discard commented maybe in boost a shame i really have to get a deeper look in this lib

 my this approach is really only beneficial if one of two things is whatever extenuating your argument signature is i kinda go by 6 as a maximum not for any specific reason though just seems right but i freely admit that this number is or many of your arguments are and sometimes you only need to set a value for the 5th one or some such annoying to write 1 either of these is true for faking named params with an associative array might be the right aside from knowing when to avoid extract avoiding it i immediately think of other being oftentimes both of these problems can be solved through refactoring as

 my understanding of your have a point on the specified as direction is the direction that a person at that point would travel to reach the north pole by the most direct possible that the north is tangent to the surface at your chosen point and points directly parallel to a line of direction of the motion will be tangent to the surface at your chosen have an angle in degrees from true north which specifies the heading at which this point is going to angle is the angle between the north and the direction of motion of the want to calculate a vector that is tangent to the surface at that point but perpendicular to the direction of motion of the understood all that you can do it as north at latitude longitude is given by vector perpendicular to the north which points along a line of latitude the is given by these two vectors identify the plane tangent to the and the vector specifying the direction of motion of your point is also in that your motion vector is a linear combination of the previous where is your heading find a vector perpendicular to that motion you can just take the cross product of the radius vector the vector pointing from the center of the earth to your with the motion math would be best to let the computer handle

 names in php start with so is the name of a is a special variable in object oriented programming in which is reference to current is used to access an object member properties or in like the syntax in your code means the value of variable into the entryid field of this operator in means pass here is a output is note the output is the above because we used a reference to where is pointing is stored in so is actually a pointer to arguments are passed by value by default by so when calling a when you pass in your they are copied by value not by this is the default in most however there is a way to have pass by reference when defining a what ever you will affect the actual parameter outside the output is are many functions that behave like like the function that sorts an array will affect directly on the array and will not return another sorted is something interesting to note because mode could result in more memory and php is an interpreted language programs written in php are not as fast as compiled to make the code run faster and minimize memory there are some tweaks in the php one is not sure about the which means you are coping a variable into php will copy a reference to the first variable into the second so your new is actually a reference to the first one until the value is not copied but if you try to change any of these php will make a copy of the and then changes the this way you will have the opportunity to save memory and if you do not change the points to equals to now php will copy 3 into and places 4 into all if you want to place the value of into property of your the above code will do and will not copy the value of until you change any of results in less memory if you actually want them both to point to the same then use

 nightly build process was broken for a long such that it generated pdb files that were a few hours different in age than the corresponding image i have since fixed the i would like to start using a symbol but cannot due to having to use these pdb i work around this issue by using the method in that means i have to organize all my pdb files by and after years upon years of that adds am looking for a way to modify the mechanism that windbg uses to mark a and force it to match my image the utility does something but for pdb the developer states on the page is capable of making an executable and pdb file match if they have different signatures but the same age this article for more information about pdb signature and if the age the tool cannot make the files took a look inside a and even found what looked like the bits corresponding to the but it must pull some more tricks cause i get it to know if this but in my particular case the age difference was caused by unnecessarily relinking which would recreate the pdb files as our build process was storing the original dlls the and the pdb after the i thought about somehow recreating such a situation by forcing a relink on a but saving off the pdb in both then i could do a binary compare of the two files to see how they perhaps run some sort of patching software that does this by seeing what exactly changed in my control perhaps i could do the same to the dlls and pdbs saved in my companies build figured it thanks to one of the comments on the first i checked out a link to the pdfs of the book windows 2000 a programmers and the author goes into great detail about the pdb file as i said i had already loaded the pdb into a hex editor and flipped some bits around appearing that i made the but it after using the utility from the w2k secrets book to the pdb into the included i found out that they hide another reference to the age in stream once i flipped that one as it matched up in this is thank you so server here i can you change an pdb to match

 not advisable to try and optimize in the way you from the search algorithm article on half the the first test will be true so that there will be only one comparison of a and but the other half of the time it will be and a second comparison this is so grievous that some versions are recast so as not to make a second test at all thus not determining equality until the span has been reduced to and thereby foregoing the possibility of early termination remember that about half the time the search will happen on a matching value one iteration short of the is quite easy to make this problem still worse as in by using an order such a b then else if a b then else than detecting equality early it might appear this will force two comparisons to be performed for all but the last iteration of a like have a comparison that allows this step to be done with one comparison that branches to three different sections the tenth line of the comparison if your language support a test languages then two comparisons is the best you can advise you to check out the from the same the the

 not possible to return the values without storing the results of the original function random number generator tells you to return these values from the original you skip the first four return the skip another return the 11th now how do you return the 3rd without saving it closest thing you could get away with is creating a list and append all the values which you skip but that sound very awkward and probably not worth the it would be very slow in the case where the shuffling algorithm returns a very big and then a very small value which case you would effectively copy most values into the which you want to rest my

 not specific to new programming the book open source by karl fogel to read may be contain some hints to the issue of making a community around your new programming terms of adoption of programming languages in it seems like the trend lately has been to have a rich library to make development times there much detail on what your language is hard to determine whether adoption of the language is going to depend on the availability of a rich perhaps your language will be able to fill a niche that has been overlooked by other languages and be able to gain or perhaps it has a slick name that will draw people in there are many factors which can affect the adoption of a are some factors that come to mind when thinking about recent successful to leverage existing libraries in the new an adapter to external libraries written in other allows access to code written in c through the a platform which already has plenty of libraries available for and target the java therefore allowing the use of and interoperation between existing java design and syntax to allow increased languages have gained such as and python to name a concise and clear code can be written in languages such as as opposed to verbose languages such as features such as as and which offered in more languages such as c and community of dedicated users who also are willing to teach newcomers on the benefits of a human factor is going to be big in support for a language if people never start using your it gain more another suggestion that i could add is to make the development of your language open keep your users posted on developments in your and allow people to give you better let your users take part in the if you feel that is believe that by offering ways to participate in the bringing up of a the more people will feel that they have a stake in the success of the new so the more likely it will gain more

 not sure i am fully but when you create an event you can say that it bubbles and so when it dispatches it will believe that would allow you to attach an event listener to your city for the right types of events and that would catch events thrown by i ever tried this though so i am not i realize you are from the following and bubbling happen as the event object moves from node to node in the display for capturing and for this process has nothing to do with the inheritance only displayobject objects objects such as containers and can have a capturing phase and a bubbling phase in addition to the targeting only way i can see around this would be for you to register the child with the parent car with the every time a new one is added as a at that point you could add an event listener in the parent and then an event from the parent any time a event is handled from the child its ugly i and you would want to make sure you remove the event listener anytime that you remove a but the only real solution i can

 object is a local variable with type that variable likely gets allocated on the stack for the just like any other local but the stored in is a null it point there is no instance of type represented call a virtual the caller needs to know which object the function is being called because the object itself is what tells which function should really be frequently implemented by giving the object a pointer to a a list of and the caller just knows supposed to call the first function on the without knowing in advance where that pointer to call a the caller need to know all the compiler knows exactly which function will get so it can generate a instruction to go directly to the desired it simply passes a pointer to the object the function was called on as a hidden parameter to the in other the compiler translates your function call into since the implementation of that function never makes reference to any members of the object pointed to by its you effectively dodge the bullet of dereferencing a null pointer because you never dereference calling function even a one on a null pointer is undefined one of the allowed results of undefined behavior is that your code appears to run exactly as you rely on although you will sometimes find libraries from your compiler vendor that rely on but the compiler vendor has the advantage of being able to add further definition to what would otherwise be undefined do it

 of the problems with statics is that you have no control over when they are instantiated as your program is in debug the compiler does many things differently than it does in release one of those things is how it manages is quite likely that you are simply getting lucky in debug that your memory is not being overwritten by other processes and the value is there when your program wants approach used to great effect is a variation of the meyers is very nicely detailed in in the singleton pattern you are not after a the approach can be used to solve your problem as static const static return primary benefit is very nicely explained by nakamura in the above construction relies on the fact that objects are only initialized when the function is first being called thus we maintain the benefit of dynamic primitive variables like static int do get translated during compile time

 of them can be complicated and complex in their own can do in the grand scheme of it might not matter which you what does matter is how well you do what you are most experienced if your leading a do what the team is most experienced have done a lot of threaded and i enjoy parts of and parts of it i do not learned a and now can usually write a application without too much but it does have to be written in a very specific it has to be written with very clearly defined data boundaries that are thread whatever condition that can will and it might not be when you have a debugger laying plus debugging threaded code is like peering into by looking in other threads may or may not have had time to process it has to be written with test code that stresses the many systems only show their bugs when the machines are heavily there has to be some very smart person who owns the data exchanging if there is any way for a shortcut to be some developer will probably make and you will have an errant there has to be situations that will reset the application with a minimum of this is for the production code that breaks because of some threading in the show must go have less experience with but have recently been doing some stuff in windows the ipc is web service and it is relatively clean and but i follow some rules here as by and interprocess communication will be much more error free because programs receive input from the outside world very and those transport mechanisms are usually define clear process boundaries and communication oh tcp or web services or pipes or whatever is as long as the borders are and there is a lot of validation and error checking code at those be prepared for code forgiveness is very by this i sometimes you be able to write to that you have to be able to requeue and retry those messages without the application locking an there will be a lot more code in because transporting data across process boundaries means you have to serialize it in some this can be a source of especially when you start maintaining and changing that this

 off topic ben has the answer you are looking for but the logic in some of your code is a little if astring name really need to check safe and common practice to reassign nil over nil and to send a release message any to the runtime short circuits the latter and the optimiser will remove the if setting a nil name is an you should assert that astring is not nsstrings are very well bother optimising out the case where you are setting the name of a car to the name that is already your check which you take every time someone set a string is slower than the release and copy you are avoiding in the minority of you check what happens when you send copy to an find it just increases the retain note that this is not true for nsmutablestring for obvious reasons good rule of thumb optimise when you have all functionality and only optimise what is slow following on from comments about rename astring to acarname or something else more descriptive your future self will thank

 on march two years after i originally answered this question i come back to see that it has pretty much turned into a big i feel about time i come back to it and make my answer truly correct since it is the most upvoted the answer is wrong as it is not what the original poster asked for it is correct that it is possible to reset a form using the native but this question is trying to clear a form off of remembered values that would remain in the form if you reset it this this is why a reset is i assume most people ended up in this question from a google search and are truly looking for the but it does not work for the specific case the op is talking answer was not use answer might work for a lot of including for the but as pointed out in the comments and in other will clear elements from any value more answer not to by by the selectors by themselves is considered bad practice by jquery as they end up evaluating to which makes it take much longer than it i do prefer the whitelist approach and wish i had used it in my original by specifying the part of the plus the cache of the form this should make it the best performing answer answer might still have some flaws if default for select elements is not an option that has a blank but it is certainly as generic as it is going to get and this would need to be handled on a

 on reading your previous i think you mean to say that you want a binary encoded rather than a is used to refer specifically to data that has been reduced in size through the application of an algorithm such as lzw in your you may find that the output is in the sense that it is smaller because for a wide variety of numbers a binary representation is more efficient than an ascii but this is not in the standard which may be why you are having trouble getting the answer you are looking think you are really asking the a number in ascii format in a for how can i write this to a file as a binary encoding are two parts to the you must convert the ascii encoded string to an integer you may use a function such as which will return a long integer equivalent in value to your ascii encoded do be aware that there are limitations on the magnitude of the number that may be represented in a long so if your numbers are very you may need to be more creative in translating you must write the data to the output stream using which does not attempt to format the bytes you give if you simply use the default stream operation to write the find that your numbers just get translated back to ascii and written out that put this all together like for for for for char char use strtol to convert to an here means the string is in as opposed hexadecimal or long intvalue convert the value to not strictly but it is good note that if you do you will have to convert back to with when you read the data netvalue create an output make sure to open the file in binary write out the data using not

 on the requirements you you seem to be needing to do much manipulation of the data in the particularly it looks like some of these can be treated as lists of data associated with the user lists of addresses and the data access code you posted already seems to be structured this i think in your scenario you have a need to make the logic side of your application more names are being treated like a list of data related to the i think you want to make the first insert of it the piece that creates the you have other information you can add to the main like interfaces consider if you are getting any out of it is a nice way to break direct dependencies between the but it look you have that scenario in the also note that declaring interfaces force you to use as you can require a property with a get to be implemented by the a type property to each of the classes used in the you can use this to reduce the code in both the interface and the data access in the you can now just loop through the list and insert all of those in the same to use something that helps you with the data like linq2sql or this will simplify the data access code and make it less error there is not a single solution for all and even in specific scenarios personal experiences will affect the way each person tackles the there are practices and principles meant to reduce but even then differences do that i suggest you read some info on ddd and they are not a recipe for these but learning about those definitely helps software about questions in the linq2sql supports stored check scott series on you loose part of the flexibility of linq2sql by using but it will help you the there are different the main issue is regarding concurrent updates to the same if concurrent updates is not an then you can just leave the latest so you just save the in that case the only original data you need is the id of the and you let the data be if you need to detect concurrent you have to either keep a copy of all the original values or use a the sp code needs to check original values match when updating the can configure linq2sql in the designer to control what type of concurrency update strategy you are using and what original values you are there are probably some in so related to how you specifically hook it will depend on the use you are giving it its generated entities or rolling your attaching sp to the entities or and even the controls you as some of them can hold original values for you

 on to what veefu templates in are not like generics topic is tagged as so i assume you are comparing them in the actual code is not generated at but only at so that if you have a class with a template in you either must have it in a header or you must instantiate exactly which instances of it or else get a linker error because it find what looking because it was never actually when doing the compiler actually makes as many of your template class as you have instantiated different of the so from the if you have and the compiler actually outputs the code for 3 different this is why templated classes are defined in header files and not in compiled because the compiler needs to generate what is in contrast to generics in java where references are and you can only use what you have specified the generic to be inherited or from you need to declare that something implements icomparable to use any of the methods from or whatever other restrictions you put on when you use a a to ensure type but actually the is in that if you have a class with a templated then depending on the size of that the resultant class will be bigger or which affects the actual size of the hope that made some though it was a bit i actually know you could do templated functions as mch

 once did some research toward improving and the problem with simulating 3d audio is that so many of the cues that your mind uses the slightly different attenuation at various the frequency difference between sounds in front of you and those behind you are quite specific to your head and are not quite the same for anyone you a pair of headphones to really make it sound like a creature is in the leaves ahead and in front of the character in a then you actually have to take that player into a measure how their own particular ears and head change the amplitude and phase of the sound at different distances and phase are and are both quite important to the way your brain processes sound and then teach the game to attenuate and the sounds for that particular do exist that have been mocked up with plastic and used to get generic curves for the various directions around the but an average or standard will never sound quite right to most the current technology is basically to sell the player five cheap have them place them around their and then the sounds while not particularly well reproduced actually do sound like coming from behind or beside the player they coming from the speaker behind the some games do bother to be careful to compute how sound would be muffled and attenuated through walls and doors can get difficult to because the ear receives the same sound at a few milliseconds different delay through various materials and reflective surfaces in the all of which would have to be included if things were to sound they tend to keep their libraries under so public reference implementations like openal tend to be pretty here is a link to an online data set that i found at the that could be used as a starting point for creating a more realistic openal sound from craig craig

 one and most answers on thread assume that the whole collection can be constructed in you normally create a collection of anonymous type in a single if you need more you may end up with a pretty useless collection of different anonymous types are useful when you create them in a single and use them right if the creation of the collection or the further processing is a bit more the anonymous type loses some of for you efficiently pass an anonymous type along to a method for as the method know the type of the object and thus have to use reflection to get anything out of you are going to repeatedly look for items in this collection of anonymous you may want to create a named type so that you can put them in a dictionary for much faster

 one is similar to the way i achieved the same sort of thing is to put a couple of values in to a table in the one is the to take the system and the other is a the date field is not then block all and on every page just use a javascript alert to display the message to users explaining that the site will be taken down in x for y reason and should be back online in z this is an annoying and way to do but really quite important that they realise that they start filling in a really long after that maintenance start then boot all users on their next page for of all the clients to periodically poll the server to check for an impending maintenance period is if you do have a couple of pages which have really long then perhaps add the ajax polling just on those these sort of values in the database is easy to is quite and is perfect for this

 original question seem to recall reading that the cost of a virtual call in is not as as in the in other the question might be rephrased seem to recall reading that in virtual and calls are equally whereas in a virtual call is slower than the questioner is not claiming that is faster than under any a useless but this sparked my curiosity concerning with using no the compiler produces il that gets converted to native code by the although it is pure so here we have a way of seeing what a standard implementation does if running on the same platform as a void new causes the opcode to be emitted with the specific method passing bar an implicit void with an inheritance virtual void derived void if we new emits the opcode which jumps to a computed address so a lot of il before the by turning it back in to we can see what is going other cast the address of to a pointer to int happens to be the same size as a and take the value at that which is the address of the and then take the first item in the which is the address to jump dereference it and call passing it the implicit can tweak the virtual example to use struct virtual void struct derived virtual void override gcnew generates the exactly as it would in instance void when compiling to target the current compiler have the same possibilities for optimization as does when using the standard features of each for a standard class the compiler generates code that contains logic for traversing the whereas for a ref class it leaves it to the jit to figure out the optimal

 other answers are good either hashing you are comparing the file to multiple or a comparison comparing two single are a couple of additional check the file sizes if they are then waste time comparing these are quick to try searching from the end or the middle of the file using a binary chop suppose you have a file like it is modified to the file size to remain the and content to have been the other bytes will be so a binary chop approach might pick this up with less reads in seek to and read bytes to from both and could try to combine the if you do it over a good enough sample of the data you deal you might find that of all the different files you compare were found because the file size was different per were found due to binary chop per were found due to linear byte comparisons per a binary chop over the whole file be so since i expect the hard disk will be faster if reading linearly rather than seeking to random but if you check then then for say 5 you might find most of the differences without having to do a bytewise some instead of reading from the front of the perhaps try reading from the end of the file again you might be trading off seek time for but in the assuming a change is made halfway into the probably find this faster by starting from the end than from the

 pointed out by pete this is implementation my answer is only correct for the sun and only prior to java 7 update right about a normal call just creating a new string referring to the same character array as the original what happens on line 5 the fact that the new string object reference happens to be assigned to a variable change the behaviour of the to be you say that in line 2 the new string will still point to the char array reference inside the string will be to the same char array as one used for but is a string in not a char in other by the time line 2 has finished ignoring there are two string both referring to the same char one has a count of 6 and the other has a count of both have an offset of wrong about line 4 using a though no pooling going on it is different to the other when you call the the new string takes a of the character data of the so completely this can be very useful if you only need a string which contains a small part of a very large original it allows the original large char array to be garbage collected nothing else needs while you hold onto the copy of the small a good example of this in my own experience is reading lines from a by will read lines using an so every string returned will use a char array of at least 80 if reading lots of very short lines the difference in terms of memory consumption just through the use of the new be very that

 possibility would be to make it a process but it depends on where the bottleneck then just turn your recordset rows into a file and when create the excel object and import the entire file into a fixed probably going to be faster than a you import csv into a fixed location on the sheet the cells are not in consecutive rows or import the csv onto a new then do mass copies from there to your template ranges should also be faster than the bulk import and mass copy that should give you some good had worksheets that processed individual cells that sped up by many factors of 10 when you use the more complex excel functionality using instead of adding up each individual cell in vba and putting that value to how to do the import from i always rely on the feature to get a baseline which can be modified those not intimately acquainted this one imports into the current sheet at sure most of that rubbish in there could be deleted but be wise to do it one at a time to ensure no problems show could also modify that with something like the following to use a different ws as savealert as ws put all that other code above in move all that data just loaded into a real

 possible to create however is not about about statically based not runtime it depends if you want with methods or just with the data classes can be implemented with boost constructs like and if you want classes with you can use to bind methods to the or you can implement them on your own with a point interface like the way is to use generics so it can all be determined at for best be seen very few although i have seen that truly need runtime in most cases objects are born and die the same or at least enough to spend of their lifetime as a single class once they come out of their in many situations one finds themselves paying too much for runtime of course there is the school of thought that this provides better developer but in many each line of code will be run on hardware a few hundred million times more than the time it took to write so you can think about and runtime classes as paying up front or leasing personally i like to pay up

 probably find an assertion in on line have a look at that source file to see what checking for you be and then stop doing it you have the source then have to whoever wrote it and find out what the assertion the api docs to see if doing something assertion is a check that coder use to ensure rules are being followed or unexpected situations are caught before any real damage is things like a doubly linked list becoming corrupt something like assert which will assert a problem if node previous node have node a as a next my mythical language in case i have the c syntax at the start of a function will raise an assertion if p1 is equal to web search turns up the following at line 345 not an ole control at it looks to be a problem with the fact that trying to dynamically create a licensed activex that link also contains a kb number q151804 which says that by design means ms probably have fixed you need to create the control with a valid license other comment that i found is not sufficient to just create an instance of activex an activex control has to be properly hosted before it can be yours you need put it on a dialog and create an instance of that seeing the rest of your hard to tell if this is your specific but if line 345 is the one i think it that makes sense complaining that the control site is null the control is not final thing to watch out your activex control in a are you trying to do something to the control you call the control will only be initialized after you call so you cannot play with the control until after you should do this in the dialogs at that the control should be fully initialized and you can do what you want with trying to use parameters from the dialogs constructor to manipulate the you need to store them somewhere in the and transfer them to the control in information was gathered mostly from

 problem is that your template is going to be instantiated in more than one compilation unit as it is completely therefore in every compilation unit that uses the template you will end up creating one singleton compilation what you would need is to force global so that all compilation units reference the same template the upcoming standard will support this via what you can do now is to disable automatic instantiation in your project and manually instantiate the templates that you use this way when you use the template in any compilation unit you will generate an unknown reference to the implementation which can then be satisfied by the linker from the compilation unit where you do the explicit

 processing xml by means of standard attribute order is not guaranteed after you serialize at last that is what i just realized when using standard java xml transform api to serialize the i do need to keep an i would like to know if there is any posibility on java to keep the original order of attributes of an xml file processed by means of dom or any way to force the order by using an alternative serialization api that lets you set this kind of in my case processing reduces to alter the value of some attributes of a sequence of the same elements with a bunch of and maybe insert a few more there any way or do i have to define my own xslt transformation stylesheet to specify the output and altering the whole input xml i must thank all your the answer seems now more obvious than i i never paid any attention to attribute since i had never needed it main reason to require an attribute order is that the resulting xml file just the target is a configuration file that holds hundreds of alarms alarm is defined by a set of this file usually has little modifications over but it is convenient to keep it since when we need to modify something it is edited by now and then some projects need light modifications of this such as setting one of the attributes to a customer specific just developed a little application to merge original file to all with specific parts of each project the value of some so file gets the updates of the base one alarm definitions or some attribute values my main motivation to require ordered attributes is to be able to check the output of the application againts the original file by means of a text comparation tool as if the format attribute remains the the differences can be easily really thought this was since xml handling such as xml lets you edit xml files and apply some ordering maybe my only choice is to use one of these programs to modify the output of xml attributes after dom

 project managers necessarily have a programming they should be familiar with the stages of the software development life cycle but that the same as programming to my the natural way of evolution is into team lead or group manager which is different than project pm should be a good maanger with a basic understanding of a software development methodology and people skills to handle the execution of the project plan and its there necessarily a need for fundamental knowledge about the technology i use since in a sense that can become quite the rabbit hole to jump how much about iis and would they have to know and then the differences between versions that can add some more to the had pretty good experience with each kind of manager in terms of project some that came from a programming background gave the ease of bonding over horror stories in using this or that for developing stuff and i enjoyed working with them as some ideas ever seem to go out of others that seem to have a technical background may still be good if they have the other key attributes like attention to methodical and creativity to handle changes to the which is the same as writing to my mind is almost purely design and implementation which ignores the other elements of designing software which includes the earlier stages like requirements gathering and analysis as well as the end stages of deployment and

 question follows on very closely to one i asked earlier but i do not think they are the same thing so thought it was sensible to split them up is a little ironic when you hear the have a web application that was split into two the dll that contained the busines logic layer methods and dal they where split into different namespaces but all within the same more i looked at it and extended the development the more i realized i was very much going down the wrong i wanted to split them up into separate so that i could have a clear separation of i had the code in different i realized that a lot of classes called each for example when a list of client objects were created in the dal it would also call the and get a list of companies that the clients belonged so i now had two classes that directly referenced each this seems like a rather bad it smelt bad but i carried on and tried to separate things out where i that end i took all the objects out to interfaces and changed all references to them to the was hoping to use some sort of di learning about that at the so for each object i created a constructor that took in a factory for that factory would create a new instance of each object that the class might i also put a default constructor in that would call the di constructor with a default factory to ensure that there was always one factory all compiled so i gave it a spin and got a this is were i fully realized that if i have two classes that require each other you can not instantiate without the iclient return new icompany return new private icompany public this public public client do stuff to get client from got client object and companyid from return private iclient public this public public company do stuff to get a company out and client for each client id return i going about the di thing all is it that factory idea should i avoid the classes needed each the reason they are like that at the moment is to avoid repeated i am sure i could write cleaner sql to get it all out in one or at least in a couple of queries in the same but i was trying to avoid repeating code in different for any and all design with

 question is actually not language agnostic at in some languages you could easily decorate the but stick to even there i say apparent thing we would like to do is some sort of of the for annotate your handlers with a then scan for all classes annotated with the messy way that basically requires the class files to be loaded or using something like you are running in a context such as an even more interesting option you can get all beans implementing a certain such as the interface void then find them in your dispatcher handlers handler method handlemethod type the code above is realize i go out of the boundaries my point is that the elegance of the solution depends on your language of what external tools you are willing to use and what framework you are

 real even if it is really hard to grasp if you have not used is that you loose the language has concepts that you cannot possibly express in and they have they are part of the but lost in the translation to is not an but rather an that you have a container that is sorted on a field of the elements that are those objects are really you need to offer access to the data for readers showing the information in the in you can go in one of two either you make a copy for the caller to use that the data will not but or you return a reference to your internally held object hoping the caller will not change your data through the user gets the reference and changes through it the field that serves as then your container invariants are you can return a constant and the compiler will disable calling setter methods on the instance you you get both the security that the user will not change and efficiency in the third not mentioned before option is making the object but that disables changes perfectly controlled changes to the object will be and the only possibility of change is creating a new element with the changes that amounts to time and

 really like the ability to overload arithmetic operators for types in but only for types with for example fixed point 3d vector complex number arbitrary length written similar code in java and been annoyed by having to write things like instead of mind a mathematician by seems to me operator overloading lets you get a little bit of goodness in without having to actually implement it really annoys me when i see being overloaded with functionality which would better be done by the dodgy but well established iostream or stl for post discovering i imagine life without and smart pointers be nearly as convenient without overloaded

 really should try to convert the column to first then use to update the document id so they start from 1 and up to the document should do it in a while one at the time because if the number column is used as reference in other tables sql server will try to update the foreign keys and maybe fail because of the end just enable identity specifications for the more work now but it will save you a lot of trouble

 reason so hard to understand is not because a difficult concept but because syntax is int are first learned that the leftmost part of a variable creation defines the type of the pointer declaration does not work like this in c and instead they say that the variable is pointing on the type to the in this on an fully grasp pointers until i tried using them in they work in exact same way but with logical and consistent the pointer is a type here a pointer to an even get me started on function	
 reason that the code work is because the n variable is not evaluated during the are creating an anonymous function in the loop that you pass to the so the code in the anonymous function executed until the mouse wheel even by then the value of the n variable is or perhaps something completely different if you are using the variable anywhere else in the you instead use the function to create the function from a you can inject the current value of the n variable into the if prevent should it be should the mousewheel event for the element call

 reason you are marking those links that be validated as opposed to those that it would be much easier the second but if you need to stick to this then the you could do something like is using the selector and only selecting links that have the class internally jquery has to get all the links in the page to see whether it has the class or which is not very you would just give a class to links that be then you can much	
 reason you cannot pass is because a parameter is given special treatment by the any parameter must be a reference that can be passed to the function you are since you want to pass the compiler is refusing to allow this since you are not providing a reference that the function is expecting to only real option would be to create a local set it to and pass that the compiler will not allow you to do much more than

 recently inherited a project that includes and assessment where you are asked a series of questions and the responses are saved to a the requirements have now changed and i need to retrieve those answers later in the in other places in this project the classes have a call to a data access object in each get that seems clunky and slow to me since that is a lot of db server trips if i have to get it seems better to me to have one call to the db and then fill all the properties in i have a class like class property variables like private bool accessor methods typical public public void typical smtp public void dao and save to it make more sense to use an overloaded constructor dao and get values to fill leave the constructor alone and create a function void dao and get values to fill you use the function is there a typical or standard for this type of so far loadfromdb is the best i can think saved settings from db in constructor or

 recognize the difference between and a bar of soap i when i originally wrote this things have changed quite a bit in the years if looking for a more i would just put the whole thing in a function little that will be more concise in your code than a simple call to said rounded roundto5secs you can put whatever you want in the function and just document how it such as these are all integer return new secbase new may also need some extra checks if secbase goes to 60 datetime objects are smart enough to bump up the minute hour if minute goes to and so

 recommendation is sending simple key name value pairs if you need to stick completely to an ascii text type the key name is used to describe the name of the field that each value conveys similar to original you can send data in a binary tagged format such as tagcodenum is perhaps a byte or word and length is a byte or word depending on your the idea of this format is that the receiver can recognize fields that it understands by the code number and then can also skip tags it know how to in this the encoding becomes if you need multiple tags grouped into logical i would wrap a group of these binary coded tags in an overall message the tag above is a replication of the previous tag construction described above and length describes the byte length of all the tags combined if you think about this not a whole lot different than an xml type structure but it is a lot more concise and constrained so that it is nearly trivial to

 rule in tdd is everything that could possibly can a getter generally so i bother to test the code i test will certainly call the getter so it be personal rule is that write a test for any function that makes a or makes more than a trivial i write a test for but i probably will for and definitely will for the emphasis on pojo has a different reason behind we want the vast quantity of our code written into pojos that depend on the environment they run for hard to test because they depend upon executing within a so we want the servlets to call pojos that depend on their environment and are therefore easy to	
 rule of thumb is as there is ever a chance that i can take the core algorithm and refactor it in a way that i can use yield i will go with if my current implementation uses an array or a but i know at least i may want to and be capable of reworking it internally to do lazy return an found that the gains of returning are definitely worth the hassle of using if the in its very is going to need to fully evaluate the results before returning but does i will go with an if already computing return implements so all of the use cases still but you lose the lazy if already forced to evaluate in not a rarely return the only time i would use this interface is if directly creating a queryable data access or something the overhead of using this in most not worth the if your goal is to always use a single interface necessarily agree with this i would stick to	
 run a run a start an executable is any file with executable you just specify it by its make a script give it the necessary a file is the is responsible for figuring out how to execte for this is done by looking at the first line of the it should contain a hashbang tells the kernel what program to run this case the command is ran with the argument the script is passed to the program second along with all the arguments you gave the script as subsequent means script that is executable should have a if it not telling the kernel what it and therefore the kernel know what program to use to interprete it could be or something the kernel will often use the default shell to interprete the which is very dangerous because it might not be the right interpreter at all or it might be able to parse some of it but with subtle behavioural differences such as is the case between and note on see hash bangs like result is that the kernel will run the program to interpret the is not always shipped by and it is not always available in while on linux machines it usually there are a range of other posix machines where ships in various such as or write a portable bash we can therefore not rely on the location of the posix already has a mechanism for dealing with the idea is that you install your programs in one of the directories that are in and the system should be able to find your program when you want to run it by you just do kernel do a search for there is a program that can do a search for called nearly all systems have an program installed in so we start using a hardcoded which then does a search for and runs it so that it can interpret your approach has one according to the hashbang can have in this we use as the argument to the that means we have no space left to pass arguments to so no way to convert something like to this have to put after the hashbang approach also has another some systems may ship with a but the user may not like may find buggy or and may have installed his own somewhere this is often the case on os x where apple ships an outdated and users install an using something like when you use the approach which does a you take the preference into account and use his preferred bash over the one his system shipped

 running a fairly complex app as a portlet on websphere portal server on aix using ibm jdk on our production system i can see a strange behaviour in the verbose gc after a period of normal behaviour the system can start rapidly allocating larger and larger the system starts to spend 1000 ms to complete each but blocks are being allocated so quickly that there is only a 30 ms gap between allocation allocation failure slightly larger than the last by some integer amount x 1024 you might have 5 and then a short while later 5 mb 17 can go on for up to 10 blocks tend to grow up to 8 to 14 mb in size before it a and i assume that now spending of time doing gc with three cores waiting for the other core to complete for 10 system performance dies at this have hibernate web services log4j output and not much interpret this as likely to be something infrastructural rather than our application if it was a bad string concatenation inside a loop we would expect more irregular growth than blocks of if it was stringbuffer or arraylist growth we would see the block sizes the growth is making me think of log buffering or something i think of anything in our app that allocations even 1 let alone today i looked for logging backing up in memory before being flushed to but the volume of logging statements over this period of gc thrashing was nowhere near the mb the problem is with the excessive memory allocation rather than with the garbage which is just doing its best to keep something is allocating a large block and trying to grow it inefficiently in increments that are far too ideas what might be causing all this when the system is under anybody seen anything similar with portal for anybody interested starting to look like the cause is an occasional but enormous database it seems the culprit is either hibernate or the jdbc garbage collection behaviour with websphere portal

 second approach is more and it is clear when reading the code that the function has no preconditions on the argument does not have an and that it will actually create an object the first approach is not so clear for the casual the call implies that the object will be changed by but it is not so clear if there are any preconditions on the passed the the code you posted is not using the assignment but rather copy the defines the value that is implemented in all major if you are not sure you can run the following snippet in your x const x const x const const x return x x you will get a single line the compiler reserves the space in the stack for the then calls the function that constructs the over fact the operations inside are applied directly on being equivalent to your first code snippet by you were not using the copy constructor you x then it would create both and and apply the assignment yielding a three line so it could be a little less efficient in

 seems just like the view rendered before that the backing has completed its only way this could happen is if you did the work in another thread but it look like you are doing am but it looks like a logic problem in your backing is your keeping that phase of the lifecycle causes to be created in the request scope phase of the lifecycle needs to iterate over every fetches the rows from the persistence store and they are cached in the bean we get to the removes the target row from the persistence but does not do anything about the cached bean phase renders the stale cached bean you refresh the bean gets recreated with new cached values and you see the correct backing bean recreates the class deletefromrowbean private listdatamodel public datamodel if list datamodel new return public string if throw new rowbean row return no navigation the list while the data table is iterating over it is not a good idea get concurrent modification the easiest solution in my sample bean is just to release the reference to the cached the data table already has a reference to this for the duration of the iteration in the when the the data table will call causing the new state to be fetched from the persistence class deletefromrowbean private listdatamodel public datamodel if list datamodel new return public string if throw new rowbean row flush cached datamodel return no navigation

 seen coolest server and seen another related to which was unfortunately a serious question as on an internal applications dev team that manages the apps on a couple dozen the networking folks typically care what we call the servers as long as they know about so we can come up with whatever apps the servers deal with can be custom or they can be larger vendor ones like they can multiple networking environments that speak to each other external servers versus different physical locations office versus new multiple deployment tiers one or many functions db mail app or disaster recovery or think even possible to come up with a convention that can address all of these or significant be nice to hear a server name dns entry for and be able to immediately know what it and it works for getting new guys up to speed as is could be parsed into internal production sharepoint web server in the california datacenter the first node in the load balancing is that seems overly complicated at first thing in the back of my mind is that an old mail relay server is getting which means we have to scour through a lot of old apps to repoint hardcoded server values server naming

 server has its own built in system for security that covers logins and this is separate and parallel to windows users and you can use just sql security and then all administration will occur within sql server and no connection between those logins and the windows if you use mixed mode then windows users are treated just like sql are a number of features of each approach if you want to use connection pooling you have to use sql or all share the same windows user not a good if you want to track what a particular user is then using the windows authentication makes using the windows tools to administer users is much more powerful than but the link between the two is for instance if you remove a windows user then the related data within sql

 short answer is there is no way to lock down the people from a specific geographic location because you guarantee the location of a user that reliably using an ip even if you it can be faked through are ways to make it more difficult for people in a region to access the but the more restrictive you get with those approaches the more legitimate users you are likely to lock for turning off the server would give you assurance that no one from china could hit but it would also give you assurance that no one in the us could

 short answer solving this in the app layer is the wrong ext4 must make sure that after i close the the data is written in a timely as it is ext4 this writing to be able to collect more write requests and burst them out in one problem is no matter what you you be sure that your data ends on the calling manually only makes things you basically get in the way of slowing the whole system ext4 has all the information necessary to make an educated guess when it is necessary to write data out to the in this i rename the temp file to the name of an existing for this means that it must either postpone the rename the data of the original file stays intact after a or it must flush at since it postpone the rename next process might want to see the new renaming implicitly means to flush and that flush must happen on the fs not the app might create a virtual copy of the filesystem which contains the changes while the disk is not modified but this affect the ultimate an app know what optimizations the fs if going to make and the fs must make sure that it does its is a case where ruthless optimizations have gone too far and ruined the golden optimization must never change the end if you maintain you must not long as tso believes that it is more important to have a fast fs rather than one which behaves i suggest not to upgrade to ext4 and close all bug reports about this is as designed by some more thoughts on you could use a database instead of the ignore the resource waste for a can anyone guarantee that the which the database become corrupted by a the database can write the data and call every minute or but you could do the do sync sleep 60 the bug in the fs prevents this from working in every people be so bothered by this could use a background config daemon like the windows the daemon would write all configs in one big it could call after writing everything problem solved for your now you need to do the same for everything else your apps text i mean almost any unix process creates a this is the freaking basis of the whole unix this is not a viable so the answer there is no solution on your keep bothering tso and the other fs developers until they fix their

 short answer would be anything that you go behind the back the to obtain can be termed as memory if you up a chunk of memory in a managed class then cantstaymanaged is responsible for freeing this memory to synchronization as a thumb rule if you call winapis to obtain to a then those are now cantstaymanaged has 2 things it needs to cleanup before it bids member fields and any resources the clr this usually equates to calling dispose on your member all the sneaky stuff we pull behind its are 2 ways the object cleanup can be triggered you called dispose explicitly on your good you forgot to call in which case the finalizer should kick in and still ensure proper both the unmanaged resources should be freed up else you should only attempt to cleanup managed resources only in former the case the clr might have already finalized and collected some of your so you access them guarantee an order in which an object graph is hence you avoid issues by guarding your managed cleanup with an guard

 should be able to handle i would look at indexing and the queries you use with the you want to structure things in such a way that your inserts cause too many index but your queries can still take advantage of the index to limit lookups to a small portion of the you might consider partitioning the this will allow you to divide the table into several logical you can do it so it still appears in sql server as one table even though it stored or you can do it manually a new or yearly table and manually move over either only do it you looked at the other options because if you get that right still end up having to check every partitioning enterprise so another reason to save this for a last

 should definitely follow the advice from javier a registry of factories is the right way to go for this implemented it that way many times in the be for format translation or some other extensible based factory solution automatic gui generation based on reflection would however suggest one addition to the design the introduction of a common domain model that is targeted by all say that you have formats b and c an that you need to support transformation between each you get all the the number of format you get an explosion of a better idea is to separate each transformation into two parts lets call it an and an the importer converts a format to the common domain model while an export converts the from the cdm to some an we decompose the conversion from a to b into the cdm is an b is an when you want to add a new format you need only write an importer and an exporter but you get translation all other talk about it also allows for formats for which yo can read but not write and vice the solution would be to have a registry of importer factories and a registry of exporter	
 should definitely use the expression with the not because faster but because you accidentally use one equals sign instead of you assign the value to the variable instead of comparing the other data types the compiler can catch as an expression like has an integer value so it be used in the if but an expression like has a boolean value so the compiler has to accept old c trick is to put the literal first so that it be an but that is less readable so the operator is a better

 solution below assumes that the lower 16 bits of the unicode space will be enough for if your bitmap table say through at positions 0x00 to 0x5e and through at positions 0x5f to 0xbe and through at 0xbf to you could do something like the code below not even contains a series of pairs of the first value in the first pair is the unicode code point which the bitmap at index 0 the assumption is that the bitmap table contains a series of directly adjacent unicode code so the second value says how long this series first part of the while loop iterates through input and builds up a unicode code point in once a complete character is the second part searches for that character in one of the ranges mentioned in if it finds an appropriate bitmap it adds it to characters for which no bitmap is present are silently function returns the number of bitmap indexes way of doing things should be in terms of the reasonably fast and reasonably code below assumes but is about three from assuming an unsigned short is short char unsigned short int int unsigned char unsigned short while if while else if this is invalid do our if if our work here is done no char at this we have a complete char in unsigned short unsigned short while if return you mentioned that you need more than the lower 16 in the above code and it can then do the whole unicode

 sounds like working within a framework that was designed by someone else where you have services and a and now that you have all this stuff looking at the big pile of code and asking there an easier the short answer is there is always an easier there are as many different ways of doing data access as there are the model using is fairly complex and sounds like it follows the principles of domain driven ddd is a great methodology and it provides excellent separation of concerns and high but it also requires a lot of plumbing code and not well understood by most programmers so getting help can be i do think the best way to build enterprise but not the best model for you to follow if new to doing a small project you might want to consider bypassing the bll no services no just have a common that contains your entity classes and build a dll that contains data access methods that directly populate and save your even simpler approach is to do away with the entity classes and just have your dll return datatables that contain your entity this approach looses the strong typing of an entity class but it is much easier to approach is to use entity ef will do all of this for you and it will generate strongly typed entity it does take a little while to get used to ef but once you understand how to work with it can drastically reduce the time it takes you to write persistence for some good tutorials on check out blog

 special would you would write at some place in the middle of the allocated memory bytes apart from the 99 bytes before the end of the allocated you would free that allocated the compiler will handle it exactly as we would the memory allocated by that is completely unrelated to null terminated you could stick everything you want into that some chunk of you could even create some arbitrary object into that memory bug is somewhere for some common error is this where the constructor is called but the destructor is called a p p new delete return int a a what happens is that the default constructor is called and the created object is copied zero or more but the destructor is run for each copy you will call the destructor on the pointer more than leading to such strange the correct way to fix is to use a smart like as an you can also do it by writing proper copy constructors that copy the object over and allocate memory in the copy so that the copy and the respective original object keep distinct

 standard approach is to mock out the that means the class testing takes a parameter which provides and looks like a database the unit you actually pass in an implementation that provides hard coded are tools which can help you with for example by saving the results of a database query into a config so that you can set up the test with real but it will load quickly and never change because it is now saved in a file separate from the is one tool you can use for

 subclass use and probably the cause of your apparent block is that takes a parameter which defaults to so your call to will actually block when there are no events to iterate which can be solved there is no real explanation why you would use this hacked up loop rather than the actual gtk main if you are already running this inside a main then i would suggest that you are doing the wrong i can expand on your options if you give us a bit more detail the complete and this only came up always always make sure you have called in any pygtk application with has different code paths when running and it needs to know to use wrote small article about pygtk and that offers you a small abstraction so you never have to worry about these that post also includes a progress bar

 suggest doing it in an object oriented try using file helpers it allows you to have an object representation for each line in your you can then persist this object to a	
 suggest making a tree of letters based on the tree would be composed of a letter like you build up the with each depth adding a new in other on the first level be the then from each of those be another another 26 and so until spelled out all the hang onto this parsed and make all possible answers faster to look this parsed you can very quickly find the for each if the struct representing it on the current depth has isword enter it as an cycle through all its if there is a child of the current node corresponding to the recursively call begin on could be sped up with a bit of dynamic for in your the two are both next to an and a which the point they hit them would be i have enough time to really spell out the code for but i think you can gather the sure find other solutions if you google for	
 suggest or hint that the schema could be so perhaps my asking this question the best use of your time and do your tables to be designed this is this application already in production triggered this thought in my head was your events happen at a but edits must be associated with original creation suspect that this is the rationale for having sub2 include a fk to but this feels to me like a denormalization relational or a violation of the principle agile in either it may make your life more complicated than it needs to advice what paying for would be to remove the fk to in its you can either include a select on the creation event for the as part of the or move the creation date into the page of these options you take depends on how much additional complexity exists in the usually prefer over would think that this would simplify your updates as well as your your mileage may

 suggestion is to use firefox and the web developer toolbar to do a view generated source after the update has occurred or inspect the elements with if the table html is still on the then it could be either a style issue or an issue with malformed html in the panel causing the table not to render if the table html is then it is being removed from the dom by the ajax you might be able to use firebug to debug the actual ajax callback as well to see what and when things are actually being the generated html before and after the update in your question would also be helpful if you still figure things out and want more

 summary lists both c and which of them are you looking c and are two distinct and differ greatly in their string handling and data structures the fact that the c ones work in change do you want a perfect hash is it that you want to associate a string with a and thought that would be a good way to do is this some sort of homework do you have a reason not to use in if you do need a perfect what are the constraints on the will there be a certain fixed set you want to dispatch what about strings that match one of the are you willing to accept hits from random or is the number of incoming strings you could edit your question to include information like we could be a lot more response to the first two we should look at c since you presumably want this for both your c and you presumably want the but have you if dealing with strings coming in on the the time there is likely to dwarf the dispatch are expecting arbitrary a bit much to expect a perfect hash function that will avoid all collisions from random so you do need to consider you considered a it may be more efficient than a perfect hash function may not it should be fairly easy to implement in and it will avoid problems with redoing your list of dispatching strings or possible	
 sun started working on swing they had things like this caused problems for programs that mase use of the main if i remember was that the compiler error messages were decided to prefix all of the swing components with j to remove this swing was called jfc java foundation presumably the j came from from was the foundation for the same team developed team moved from netscape to j was there at the first source drop to licensees was the person why received the drop at my and the ifc became the which became were incompatible as i use bwt controls in an ifc response to an email from a member of the swing names were already by awt and we thought it useful to a common prefix to from other classes in already taken part does match with what i said about the but does not confirm

 surprised at how many people suggest that the os can do a better job at figuring out your caching needs than you can in this specialized while i do this for i did do it for similar processes and i ended up using a ramdisk with scripts that automated the this i think go with a modern source control at every compile it would check in the source code an experimental branch if automatically so that every compile would result in the data being saved start start the ramdisk and pull the current base do the etc all the while the edits are being saved for the final check in when and you even have to involve your regular there are background synchronizers that will automate things the issue is that they be optimized for programming and may need to do full directory and file scans occasionally to catch a source code control system is design for exactly this so it would likely be lower overhead even though it exists in your build in mind that a background sync in the case of a power is you would end up having to figure out what was saved and what saved if things went with a defined save point each or forced by have a pretty good idea that it was at least in a state where you thought you could compile use a vcs and you can easily compare it to the previous code and see what changes applied

 talking about streaming protocols like sip or rtsp then the way it works is that the udp port the client wants the server to send to is specified in the call set up server will send to that port and the traffic may or may not get through to the client depending on whether the nat has translated the choice of port to a different number or the server receives first udp streamed packet from the client and if it is on a different port to the one it was sending on then it will switch to this lets the udp from the server get through the nat since the client has already created the nat mapping by sending to the

 that should be posible with some of dealying the you can stop it before it reaches original clone it and then refire the clone after the you know how events work in the displaylist you can in flash let me first explain you click a button a mouseevent is it begin in the capturing fase where it starts on the stage calling all eventlisteners registered for the event in the order of the priority set when the listeners was if listerners has the same priority default is the are called in a random order the order that they where all listeners for the stage has been called the next displayobject in the list of the buttons ancestors is and the same thing happens continue all the way down to inner most displayobject that allow mouse events be a textfield label inside the the capturing phase ends and the target phase all the listeners on the innermost object is called in the target the bubbling phase where all the listernes are called on parents and grandparents all the way up to the stage in the same manner as before from the inside should be noted that in flash the target phase is handled as part of the bubbling how can we use when you register and event listener you specify the phase and the defaults are bubbling phase and priority so if we register a click event listener on the stage for the capturing phase with priority we would get the event before any other listerne except perhaps another identical following code would prevent click events to registered by other raises some other firstly you want to do it for solution would be be to have of all buttons that should events and it with solution would be to have that require a an interface call and then simple is third solution would be to for the events on a a since it that you would use the it reaches this parent the first two solutions you should prevent mouseinteraction for the children of the buttons to simplify detection matter what you choose next you would have to delay with a simple and then fire the event again after the raises the problem of not delaying the refired my suggestion would be to instead fire an event object that inherits from mouseevent instead of a simple the mouseevent is very simple to it only has a few so when you capture it the second time you can check if its a normal mouse click or your the solution with the inface on the it would be something is idelaybutton is code for the cloning and refiring the event might need to listen for more types of events but most of the code can be made generic enough to include that helps and sorry about the long

 the benefit is somewhat depending on what gets passed its biggest weakness at the same since so generic and you really enforce a lot of constraints validity seen this approach in many places web database schemas and they usually work fine for two or three separate but begin to fall apart the more complex they would strongly recommend creating methods for each thing you want to also extending an existing service with additional methods while not changing any of the existing interfaces can be done very easily and without any change to the too so you can always easily extend your service as your requirements without breaking backwards	
 the best of my there are no preprocessor directives for detecting strict you are using then the compiler will warn you about code that may break the strict aliasing this option is only active when it warns about code might break the strict aliasing that the compiler is using the warning does catch all but does attempt catch the more common it included in it is to the code you are working on is critical then you can disable in or if you want to disable strict i suggest looking at the asm output to make sure the compiler doing dangerous optimizations that you an akauppi said in the enables strict optimizations for particular restrict keyword does not directly but rather it gives the compiler more information and that extra information indirectly helps the compiler determine if it can apply specific optimization good explanation of the restrict keyword from dsp compiler help the compiler determine memory you can qualify or array with the restrict the restrict keyword type qualifier that may be applied to and its a guarantee by the programmer that within the scope of the the object pointed to can be accessed only by that of this guarantee renders the program this practice compiler optimize certain sections of code because aliasing be more easily

 the buffering inherent in all the stdio i would be tempted to read the stream character by character with a simple finite state machine can identify word and line boundaries if an advantage is the complete lack of buffers to aside from whatever buffer you collect the current word in if your further processing requires might want to do a quick benchmark comparing the time required to read a large file completely with an outside constraint requires that the file really be read a line at a time if you need to handle input from a then probably is your friend as other answers point but even then the approach may be acceptable as long as the input stream is running in mode which is common for stdin if stdin is on a to have control over the buffer on the input you might need to call or to force it to a buffered if the input stream ends up then using an explicit buffer of some form will always be faster than on a raw performance would probably use a buffer related to your disk at least two disk blocks in size and probably a lot more than even that performance can be beat by arranging the input to be a memory mapped file and relying on the paging to read and fill the buffer as you process the file as if it were one giant of the if performance is going to matter then you will want to benchmark several approaches and pick the one that works best in your and even the simplest expression of your problem may still be the best overall answer if it gets debugged and

 the examples you i think actually asking what the if is there between using the method and then the difference do stuff and do stuff answer is that it really a matter of the event methods are syntactically simpler and involve less as far as i know there really any i prefer to use the bind methods because you can use shorthand event binding if you need to attach more than one event to the same it also makes it simpler to understand you need to an from what the actual question the difference between the method and the a totally different should never really use the method to attach events because the and methods use the quicker css selector engine it uses the sizzle hardly ever a case where do something is better than do stuff

 the general it will be faster with the some points to data on the disk is organized in surfaces tracks and it takes the disk some time to position the reading heads so that you can start reading a now you need five blocks from that you ask for then in a different order than they appear on the physical the cache will help greatly by reading the whole track into memory more blocks than you then reindex them the head starts to it probably will be on the not on the start of the first without have to wait until the first block of the track rotates under the head and start reading the time to read a track would be effectively so with a you can read the blocks of a track in any order and you start reading as soon as the head arrives over the the file system is pretty the os will start to squeeze your data into various empty imagine block 1 is on track block 2 is on track block 3 is again on track without a loose a lot of time for positioning the with a track 5 is kept in ram as the head goes to track 7 and when you ask for block you get it files need a lot of namely where the data blocks for the file in this the cache will keep this data live as you read the saving you from a lot more head cache will allow other programs to access their data in an efficient way as you hog the so overall performance will be this is very important when a second program starts to as you in this the cache will collect some writes before it interrupts your most programs read process it and then write it without the a program would either get into its own way or it would have to implement its own caching scheme to avoid head cache allows the os to reorder the disk say you have blocks on track 7 and 13 but file order asks for track 13 and then more efficient to read track 7 on the way to 13 rather than going all the way to 13 and then come back to while reading lots of data would be faster without a this is only true if your file is the only one on the disk and all is ordered the physical layout of the data is in such a way that the reading heads always start reading a track at the start of the first

 the nat in front of the client at the tcp level will be able to determine that the connection at the udp was having said the nat on the client side will have to be configured to accept udp packets from the src server and then forward them to the internal destination ip important thing to remember if nat is who is the caller and who is the nats differ in implementation and capablity so a generic easy to implement solution is probably what you might want to depending on your are correct in i that in your case client will not be able to receive the udp stream in in your case your client will have to send its wan ip to your server to initiate the udp finding your clients wan ip can be tricky but there are websites that will aid your determing your wan ip by returning it in a text the udp connection is created after the tcp connection by the server opening a socket to the client to a known udp port upnp might be worth looking into it will allow you to automatically set up your port forwards on your that is only if your nat supports upnp as is the case of dsl would be to client to open both tcp and udp sockets to the since the client behind the nat initiated the connection the states of both tcp and udp connections will be added to the connection

 the the difference between a project and an an app is a web application that does something a weblog a database of public records or a simple poll a project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular web a project can contain multiple an app can be in multiple versus is really more of a separate but understanding the distinction django draws between a and an is a big part of good code roughly this is what the two terms application tries to provide a relatively set of related an application is allowed to define a set of models it have and to define and register custom template tags and filters it have project is a collection of installed into the same and all using the same settings in a the defining aspect of a project is that it supplies a settings file which specifies the database to the applications to and other bits of a project may correspond to a single web but have to multiple projects can run on the same the project is also responsible for the root url though in most cases useful to just have that consist of calls to include which pull in url configurations from inidividual custom custom context processors and most other things django lets you create can all be defined either at the level of the project or of the and where you do that should depend on most effective for in best placed inside an application increases their portability across

 there is a why see in msdn it will often say class is threadsafe for static something like it means when ms wrote the they intentionally used synchronization primitives to make the static members this is common when writing libraries and because it is easier to make static members threadsafe than instance because you know what the library user is going to want to do with if they made instance members threadsafe for many of the library they would put too many restrictions on you so often they let you handle you likewise need to make your static members threadsafe document that they the static are threadsafe in a the clr will make sure they are called only once and will prevent 2 threads from getting into a static marc pointed out in the comments an edge case in which static constructors are not if you use reflection to explicitly call a static apparently you can call it more than so i revise the statement as as long as you are relying on the clr to decide when to call your static then the clr will prevent it from being called more than and it will also prevent the static ctor from being called	
 there is already a significant quantity of legacy c code that will be added to the system then why move to and response to your latest edit about wanting to take advantage of any improvements in processing your best bet would be to stick to c as it runs closer to the hardware than and java which have the overhead of a runtime environment to deal the closer to the hardware you can get the faster you should be able to higher level languages such as and java will result in quicker development better yet assembly will result in quicker processing longer development

 these methods are very different in terms of what they get compiled though very much similar in terms of try to summarise the differences in is a simple private instance easily going to be the most efficient when is a property a get but no set is a normal parameterless i suspect just offering these examples purely as a point of and realise that such a function is totally useless are private in almost all the layout everything on one is also rather 2 and 3 are going to be equally inefficient compared to 1 in that they both involve the overhead of function i know by memory the cil code that they all compile to someone else can produce but they certainly involve a few more whereas referencing ought to only require a single instruction in sure i can make a very useful comment on best practice without knowing more about the but method 2 a private is generally seen as quite the third method should never be used in my opinion begging to be turned into a i think what you really want is just a plain old private so definitely go for the first public values should always be accessed as properties rather than variables in classes a backing variable to a but that is slightly unrelated to your could find plenty of resources discussing the matter in a quick search note that if your is going to be not modified at any you really want to use a const string mystring1 that helps clarify things a

 thing you can try is taking the fft of your 1d line and then removing later for in matlab i did the truncate to 250 tended to happen was that the peaks of the ifft of f were very close to peaks of they necessarily the highest points of but they were for this there were peaks at and 725 in the inverted fft of and there were also peaks in y at and global max was at which was a peak in but not a very high this only really cuts your data usage in because i converted 1000 doubles into 250 complex a further increase can be obtained by only using the real part of the only uses the space still yielded pretty good with each major peak of corresponding to a peak in y that was only at most a distance of 2 away most of the and you use the space of storing the double this still get you the results of or two double you are now packing 2500 doubles into you can experiment by cutting more but you will have to test more values by cutting more maybe you can keep the first of and find the and then look within a distance of 3 or this would reduce your 2500 doubles to a only testing will find out what works best for your you can go as low as the lowest and search 5 or 6 in either direction for the true but this still leaves you with 25 think any way to convert 2500 doubles into only 1 or and have it reversible into anything take a look at information theory texts to see suggest you get gnu or even and play around with something like this and find what results are best for	
 thing you could do is create several different methods for methods with no one for methods with one like static void static void t static void t u you can have a private method which actually does the similarly to your current but not exposed to client static void params edit this code to run it on the background report client code will call one of the public methods which will enforce the requirement that the right number and types of arguments are	
 thing you could do is make the primary key this results in the actual data being physically ordered on the resulting in faster will also mean slower but if you select much more frequently than you this should not be a	
 thing you know about the inner prism is that it will have the same ratios as the outer in other words given the height of the inner prism you can calculate the inner base length and from there the know the base will have 1 unit so that leaves calculating the distance from the pinnacle of the inner prism to the pinnacle of the outer distance is the hypontenuse of a right angled the angles in the triangle are known since they are function of the base length and one side of the triangle is of length being the perpendicular from the inner edge at the inner pinnacle to the outer final side of the triangle is where that perpendicular intersects the outer edge up to the outer is enough info to use standard trig to caclulate the hypotenuse this length plus 1 thickness the subtracted from the original height gives you the inner the ratio between the inner and outer heights can be applied to the base a probably cleverer ways to do this but this would be my common bloke	
 things come to just because you received an email with a plain text password mean stored in plain we and email out in plain bad but a step up from plain use a password manager if worried about this type of you control other password bad what you can control is your good practices and the damage done if one of your passwords is use it has a password generator that you can modify the rules to so that you can have super obscure passwords specific to the	
 things they want you to put them the regardless of where it is you think put shops have standards for a is no distribution of liability with a cpan in the shop i currently work we have such a deal with our encapsulated accounting software we call them in the middle of the night if our app is down and we need their because if our calculations mess up badly our contract with them ensures that will be paying part of the depending on their exposure with a given you get out into the real where perl scripts can run alongside old you may understand how much more at ease managers are with running the cobol than they are with depending heavily on ardent however my current shop is somewhat comfortable with perl for scripts and and will install the occasional cpan but the approval process is the sandbox testing is long but makes it i can only imagine that they could approve one or two new not new because of how many new situations it would expose them so the modules created by the just use crowd are pretty much out if any dependency says recommended for production or d

 think doing this at the repository level is a much better mostly because you in the decide to add some method of access to your repository which does not go through mvc a wcf interface to the the question how do you address the cons listed about doing it on the nhibernate out the useful entities is simple i would probably do this via a custom attribute on the entity you can tag the entities you want to or the ones you whichever is out what the controller really intended is going to dispute that you can the i think it is a good idea to do this in a because the separation of the repository should not be dependent on the one method would be to create custom methods on the repository for actions like to track this is especially attractive if there are other aspects of these edits which behave such as different another method is to examine the changes by comparing the old and new versions of the objects and derive the actual nature of the a third method is to make no attempt to derive the nature of the but just store the before and after versions in the log so that the person who reads the log can figure it out for

 think going to be better off randomly picking from a list of pregenerated colors that meet your requirements different enough from each than trying to generate colors on the to far as keeping more than one user from having the same one thing seen systems do is to just assign colors locally on the users machine using usually not that important that different users see the same colors for other i care if the colors on my screen are the same as they are on some other as long as all the colors on my screen are in fact it may be desirable for each own text to be distinct is everyone is for	
 think i got the image add the image as and the src attribute contains just the image file no any path is if more than one image files are just use to separate send email to my outlook email and it try it to my yahoo	
 think i know why this fails to work as because the initial user list is a linq it is each time it is iterated when used in and again when doing the and new user objects are this would lead to different references and so no using fixes this because it iterates the linq query once only and so the references are been able to reproduce the problem you have and having investigated the this seems like a very plausible i proved it just ran the test but outputting the collection before the call to in that and after each time the hash code for the object was output and they do indeed have different values each time indicating new as i is the output for each of the here is the modified code to show the int string user iuser public int public string public override string return id public static locallist new new new var matches from u in join lu in on equals select return public static void foreach user in static void xdocument doc new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new users new id name a objects have not been var matches var excludes excludes should contain 6 users but here it contains 8

 think it is particularly common to find genetic algorithms in they are more commonly found in code where the need to find the is less important than the need to just find a good solution to a i have consulted on a couple of commercial projects that do use gas as a result of my involvement with i think the most interesting example was at a biotech they used the ga to optimise scoring functions that were used for virtual as part of their drug discovery this with my i added a new feature to one of our products that uses another i think we might be marketing this from next the ga is used to explore molecules that have the potential for binding to a and could therefore be further investigated as drugs targeting that a competing product that also uses a ga is

 think mixing up contexts a behavior if the database available is to not log errors to the if an exception is thrown on the server or if you raise an exception via an elmah is going to let that exception pass through to either a yellow screen or a custom errors page page is only accessible to those that should be seeing it it is okay to present that error to the bottom line is that if the errors database is down you diagnose for if that were the have bigger problems since the error database sits with the production would also advocate against using xml logging for your primary logging sql server is going to give you the best performance without having to manage the with xml logging that is not the

 think overestimating the complexity of being you need to store the 3d models for the or their or any of the things that make up large parts of a of as chaos only necessary to store information about things that have been even you probably only need to for each of the new position and orientation not other variables like so two vectors for each which will be around a grand total of 24 bytes per that means you can store the information for objects per an awful lot of objects to have moved this data is no more complex than placing the objects in the first every object has to have a default defined for the game to put it so all doing is replacing the default with the stored value in the save this is not and require any significant additional

 think that everything suggested is there are a couple ways you can go about validator an could be done addressvalidator new valid address address way you recognize that the addressvalidator is coupled to the you could do this using the iscomplete in is a good oop heuristic to say that all objects should construct with valid but it just always oop maximizes the information you can take advantage force as many errors to occur at compile rather than run user interfaces will thwart this at all you kind of have to violate this think the j2ee convention is to construct objects without parameters and call a hundred for address int two you want to be technical about valid then you really have two different the state returned by your ui and the state needed by your why not make the difference for if my ui has 12 fields i could have a object that has 12 string in control of regardless of what the user i can make sure the ui returns 12 you can then create an instance of and call on uiaddress address modeladdress all going to depend on your intended but there really is a lot of flexibility for the way is to put in the

 think that test driven programming is the before actually implementing the you first create a unit test it a then gradually implement the functionality and make sure the contract is still valid as you usually i start with plain stubs and then gradually fill out the rest replacing the stabs with real keep improving and making the test at the end you end up with a robust implementation of said module plus got a fantastic test bed coded implementation of the later if someone modifies the first you see if it can still fit the test if it the contract is broken reject the the contract is fix the unit and so boring cycle of software development

 think there is a way to do not exactly like that since this is a private field and you control it you can just declare it private myclass also make sure in all your code that only objects that implements myinterface are affected to and cast everywhere you need to access it as the it looks and it is could also create the following derived class myderivedclass extends myclass implements myinterface then use private myderivedclass is much but you have to create an other just for that

 think this is a programming question so i am i have tracked it down to the dll provided by the when the app it looks like a problem with the way the dll is the call stack shows a memory free operation in the then a operation in the then a operation in and a subsequent heap then that tears down the whole still understand why it works in a windows forms app and in iis but not work in iis this has become more of a platform question than a it is probably the responsibility to fix it rather than mine to work around within two days of filing the tech support ticket with the they provided an updated set of the integration dlls that use a com object that you register with and it works in iis7 if you register it in the wow64 yea for first data technical	
 think this is completely solvable in using only you know the calling convention used by the target for there is a risk that you end up the or at least having to what if the compiler decided to build the registered function using arguments passed in perhaps due to some optimization setting what if it was built with a different also no way in general to express in c that you want to call a function with a given set of and that the values for the arguments need to be unpacked from a buffer of random could do something horrible like void const void signature case int x void case quite clear that this live on the same continent as you could of course this for some reasonable set of return types and argument still be a bit out in the cold for casting function pointers but that might be still always run the risk of someone handing you a signature that you have code

 think understood your question but you can make use of set datatype and generator schedule only accepts an even number of if 0 while team list from sql select team in keeps sql processing to a minimum and should be very easy to add to new like the ones i understand good makes more sense should have had one less in which definitely recommend take a look through the and look at consuming the teams array as you are grabbing random it would probably be best to feed the home and away teams from the home day into the away so you can ensure there that each team plays home and away each

 think what you are doing should work fine just return the number of occurrences as the exit code from the mention that will only allow numbers below i highly doubt if this is the but it would be simple enough for you to write a test program to find out for like this is really just a simplified version of you might want to have a look at that algorithm as well for some ideas on how you could further parallelize the program and maybe get some extra credit for the difference between and if you just want to wait for any of your child processes to you would use if you want to wait only for a specific child process or if you wanted to just check if a child process has exited without you would use

 think you are trying to solve the wrong sounds like you have a trunk which contains versions of maps which are not yet and when you do a you want to cherry pick which maps to update from all the possible updates on this is the create a branch called creating a new empty and copying each map version needed separate svn cp if that will be you have the current release in the tag it cp the whole with where xxx is the meaningful id for your latest as maps are approved for the next svn cp them to your release i assume you want to use because maps a discrete elements not source the time of the next you can tag you what the latest approved maps are and what was in every if you remember the latest release and you can come up with a time need to know without just looking in the tags you can create a tag which svn cp the latest then blow it away and when you do the next

 think your solution is just except that you need to use instead of in thread 1 with it actually wait for you cannot use a mutex for because it needs to be released by the same thread that locked but a semaphore based lock would using a monitor would be just more deadlocks are impossible if the initialization part of offlineworker the code before it releases the wait if there are actual deadlocks with your any other solution that makes thread 1 wait for thread 2 would have them too can imagine such after if you pass messages to thread 1 while it is waiting for the initialization of thread 2 to you have a possibility of particularly if there is some bounded buffer for messages or if the message passing function waits for in this i would suggest just abandoning the idea of waiting for thread 2 and maybe pass some callback that would be called from thread 2 when initialization

 this answer is based on the idea that need to do similar things for different entities and different properties elsewhere in your if you need to convert the list of viewvalues to a list of longs by then stick with your original if you want a more reusable read would declare an interface for the interface public result you can write a single generic conversion results new for element return you can define simple projections like static final new public long return apply it just like ids using bracing and longer lines makes the projection declaration a bit shorter all of this would be a lot nicer with lambda but never

 this should be if you need to require a default case which would require you should consider changing to a of the core design guidelines for structs do ensure that a state where all instance data is set to or null is see design just looked this section up in the design guidelines 2nd and they have an example in detail there using properties and overrides to work around as the basic concept was to save the value privately in a way that 0 is the and do some form of transform in every property and method override in their they used a positive integer as an and always save in the private so the default value is treated like a value of they added a constructor with an int and save seems like a lot of unexpected though so personally still recommend a class in this edit in response to comments as your is the way it is because 0 at datetime uses a ulong to represent ticks from that is why datetime value type represents dates and times with values ranging from january 0001 anno domini through december 9999 is the full range of ulong in a in the struct of datetime is treated as when you convert to a string the values 1 1 a single

 this type of probably use string in be the best way to do this probably depends partly on why you have to define before a string repeated a and you wanted to put it in a global variable or printf would be my or putting it in a function as other answers have the string is only used once or are you sure you refactor the code to make be defined before a bit of bland you write immediately takes the value of and puts it into the after it worried about for purposes of and even if because it contains a literal copy of the as far as a way of binding a position in a string to a the method leaves placeholders in the which the function printf replaces with values when you decide what should go in the if you wanted to only not have to call another get no way to do the closest method would be using placeholders and but that requires an explicit call to a not an implicit

 this we want to avoid having to write a special query since the query would have to be different across multiple using only hibernate we want to be able to escape special situation is the reason for needing the ability to escape special that we have table in the table contains only 1 called the field can contain characters that may be considered special in a two examples of such a name are and both the and are special at least in if a user wants to search for one of these examples after they are entered in the problems may this is the value that the user has given the application to use for its if the user wants to search for the user is going to be returned with every entry in the this is because the character represents the number of wildcard for string matching and the sql code that hibernate produces will look from foo where name like there a way to tell hibernate to escape certain or to create a workaround that is not database type hibernate is there a way to escape special

 thought i really understood and the standard just confirms my obviously wrong so now i ask following program struct int struct int char this line return the expressions and according to my interpretation of the array definition of the operator is that identical to this has type to and the value is the start address of therefore evaluates to an integer object whose storage is at the same address that and function when it is the operand of sizeof operator or the unary an lvalue that type of is converted an expression with type that points to the element of the array object and is an has type of and is as described above converted to to with the address of the first element as therefore evaluates to an integer object whose storage is at the same address that the first element in the structure and union pointer to a structure suitably points to initial member and vice there may be unnamed padding within structure but not at as necessary to achieve appropriate the first member of is the the start address and the whole object is the same as described understanding were therefore that evaluates integer whose storage is at the same address that the in the array and thus is identical to this cannot be the because the program crashes cygwin and linux with gcc versions so any environmental issue is completely out of the is my reasoning do i not do i declare to make ptr point to the first member of the vs array in

 thoughts for a framework like session object on page and set it to default to a this initialization make your session object to look for a session identifier a and validate that id against your session tracking be it database or whatever you are the session id you get your relevant user id which you can then use to populate the user control should just authenticate the user from and initialize the session by binding session id and user id on the back and by writing the session id to a a more efficient would be to authenticate the user once and write the user id to a digitally signed cookie set by the and trust all valid cookies returned by the this would make session management so much lighter and save round trips do

 threads might be running on different with different memory they might be running on the same with one interrupting the this has two you have no way of knowing whether one thread will be interrupted by another in the middle of doing so in your no way to be sure that thread1 try to read the string value before thread2 has written or even that when thread1 reads it is in a if it is not in a consistent then using it might do when you write to memory in one there is no telling if or when code running in another thread will see that the change might sit in the cache of the writer thread and not get flushed to main it might get flushed to main memory but not make it into the cache of the reader part of the change might make it and part of it without locks other synchronization mechanisms such as you have no way of saying whether something that happens in thread a will occur or something that happens in thread you also have no way of saying whether or when changes made in thread a will be in thread use of locking ensures that all changes are flushed through the so that code sees memory in the state you think it should it also allows you to control whether particular bits of code can run simultaneously interrupt each this looking at your code the minimum locking you need is to have a synchronisation primitive which is by the second thread after it has written the and on by the first thread before using that this would then guarantee that the first thread sees any changes made by the second assuming the second thread started until after firstfunctionrunfromthread1 has been if that might not be the then you need the same deal with thread1 writing and thread2 simplest way to actually do this is to have a mutex which your you decide what data and any code which reads or writes the data must be holding the mutex while it does so first you then read write the then this ensures consistent but on its own it does not ensure that thread2 will get a chance to do anything at all in between two different kind of mechanism will also include the necessary memory so if you send a message from the writer thread to the reader meaning finished you can read then that will be can be more efficient ways of doing certain if those prove too

 trying to use an unmanaged c dll for loading image data into a the library has a fairly simple interface where you pass in a struct that contains three one to receive the size of the one that receives each row of the pixels and finally one called when the load is like this managed struct public public public types starting are delegate int int the test file that using the setsize should get called then the sendline will get called 200 times for each row of pixels in the finally the done callback gets what actually happens is that the sendline is called 19 times and then a accessviolationexception is thrown claiming that the library tried to access protected have access to the code of the c library i change the and during the loop where it calls the sendline method it does not allocate or free any new so my assumption is that the delegate itself is the issue and i need to pin it before i pass it in have no code inside the delegate itself besides a counter to see how often it gets so i doubt breaking anything on the managed the problem is that i know how to do the method been using to declare the structs in unmanaged space work with delegates and i find any other suitable the delegates themselves are static fields in the program class so they be being garbage but i guess the runtime could be moving blog entry by chris says that delegates need to be pinned before being passed into unmanaged the unmanaged function pointer must refer to a fixed it would be a disaster if the gc were relocating this leads many applications to create a pinning handle for the this is completely the unmanaged function pointer actually refers to a native code stub that we dynamically generate to perform the transition this stub exists in fixed memory outside of the gc i know if this holds true when the delegate is part of a it does imply that it is possible to manually pin them and interested in how to do this or any better suggestions as to why a loop would run 19 times then suddenly to answer code that allocates the struct is as new new some other sendline protocolsize the and the variables are both static fields of the program if i understand the internals of this that means that passing an unmanaged pointer to a of the variable into the c but that copy contains a reference to the static this should mean that the copy touched by the gc since it is unmanaged and the delegate be collected since it is still in scope struct actually gets passed to the library as a return value from another but as a static intptr return there is another struct type that holds the image filename and the function pointer to this the library figures out what type of image is stored in the file and uses this callback to request the correct protocol struct for the given my filename struct is declared and managed in the same way as the protocol one so probably contains the same but since this delegate is only called once and called quickly i had any problems with it to to everybody for their but after spending another couple of days on the problem and making no progress i decided to shelve in case anyone is interested i was attempting write a tool for users of the lightwave 3d rendering application and a nice feature would have been the ability to view all the different image formats that lightwave supports of which are fairly i thought that the best way to do this would be to write a wrapper for the plugin architecture that lightwave uses for image manipulation so i could use their code to actually load the unfortunately after trying a number of the plugins against my solution i had a variety of errors that i understand or fix and my guess is that lightwave call the methods on the plugins in a standard probably to improve the security of running external code stab in the i for the time being going to drop the image feature and if i do decide to reinstate it approach it in a different i learnt a lot through this process even though i get the result i a delegate within a struct before passing to unmanaged	
 trying to use python ctypes to use these two c functions from a shared char long int first function is working i can tell by putting some debug code in the shared library and checking the problem is getting the data the rgb buffer is a pointer to a float and this pointer stays constant during the life of the therefore whenever i want to decompress an i call and then need to see at the location pointed to by i know that the buffer size is 288 so i guess this has to come into play no type so i thought try i is just guessing the actual address rather than the but even if i was successfully dereferencing the pointer and getting the it would only be the first can i get the contents of the entire buffer into a python had to then answer python ctypes to get buffer of floats from shared library into python

 two key patterns in my experience and singletons which gradually grow over this could include poorly implemented and used connection dictionaries of user seen since from objects to objects which were to be in this can happen with and the equivalent observer pattern could give the same sort of effect in basically if you ask one object to watch another then you usually end up with a reference the source the that can end up being the only but live as long as the leaks if you keep generating new code on rockier ground but pretty sure run into problems this possible this was partly due to jre bugs which have since been fixed been too long since it happened for me to remember for tests which hold onto state can last longer than you might expect because junit will hold onto the testcase again i remember the but sometimes this makes it worth having explicit in the anachronistic as that say that regularly found memory leaks to be a problem in java

 unload event is raised in the control right before since the page itself is a control the unload event is raised for it as each control you add to the page will be part of the page so if you have a control that needs to do some the control itself should handle any possible cleanup in you should not have to worry about provided the control has been added to the page and properly follows the encapsulation says that you should use this even do final cleanup for specific such as closing database my recommendation would be to avoid the unload when possible do any cleanup code sooner rather than so use if you in a like the choice between using a variable as opposed to a local the latter is

 updates are a questionable sometimes they seems in many a better application design can remove the need for bulk some other part of the application already touched each object one at a the update should have been done in the other part of the other the update is a prelude to processing in this the update should be part of the later general design strategy is to refactor applications to eliminate bulk

 url encoding is going to encode that string so that it would be passed properly in a url to a final for example you could not have urlencoding the parameter would fix that parameter i have two choices for you have access to the path separate from the if so you may be able to simply urlencode the if this is not the case then option 2 may be for this has a class will output exactly what you are looking as it will only encode the path part of the need and for this method to work at	
 us say for a moment that allowed multiple return values in the most pure where we would expect to see something sender receiver receiver that i do not have to understand the return values of the method until i actually make the method perhaps i rely on intellisense to tell me what return dealing or perhaps searching for a method that returns what i want from a class i am unfamiliar we have something like in sender the argument to getparticipants is an string this is a bit different than the above because it means i have to preempt or at least go back and code that creates a variable to hold the result of the out this is a little question is there any syntactic sugar in current that allows a developer to make this declaration in the same line as the method i think it would make development a bit more and also make the code more readable if i were doing something sender string show that receiver was being declared and assigned on the syntactic sugar for out

 use char when length of the value is for example we are generating a code or something based on some algorithm which returns the code with the specific fixed lenght lets say i found varchar one more reason to use varchar is that when you get the value back in your application you need to trim that in the case of char you will get the full length of the column whether the value is filling it fully or it would get filled by spaces and you end up trimming every and forgetting that would lead to

 validating against xmlschema in and getting saxparseexceptions thrown when i have content going to be using these exceptions to highlight where the validation has failed but the saxparseexceptions seem to be a little too for a failure on an i get the validity error that the value provided match the content model in one and the element it applies to in the thinking i need to have a utility that abstracts a little to merge related errors together and parse exception text into useable exception this a reasonable or am i just missing or maybe a library or helper thanks for the a saxparseexception i found on value is not respect to pattern key things for me to which this exception why can i not call or and why not an xpath to the element in more useful with an document than the line and column a pattern validation why can i not get something like a enumeration of possible types of failure and a reference to the appropriate actual pattern that validation has failed be another exception thrown next to tell me the value of the element that caused the problem that i need to example of what like to be able to do is have people submit a document and have the document highlighted where validation fails with a user friendly message the error message above kinda seem very having to parse by single quotes just feels like an accident waiting to happen think maybe doing it wrong with the and perhaps i should have an identity transform of the document by default as part of the and augment the transformation with attributes that i can pick out with that still help if i need to parse the messages to make them more friendly tight throws anyway not sure how i can get away from assuming the to use saxparseexception effectively in

 very convenient to have r scripts for doing simple plots from the command running r from bash scripts is not convenient at the ideal might be something i been able to make either of those option is keeping the scripts purely in and invoking it with or occasionally a script will rely on obscure command line switches at which point part of the code exists outside the sneaking things into r from bash via a local the desired switches are then everything implies except option is a bash script to store the r flags and be painlessly which then calls the r the problem is that this means a single program just got split into two files which now have to be keep in transferred to new machines option i currently despise least is embedding the r in a bash usage message to catch bad input without invoking any bash of r code goes in a single executable and easily handles the problem is that combining bash and r like this pretty much eliminates the possibility of any ide not failing on one or the and makes my heart hurt real there some better way the best way to use r scripts on the command

 view structure is based on the not the model in the mvc you should have a view for each action public in a the controller actions have to match up directly to each table in database but there is likely some sort of direct relationship between the number of tables in the database and the number of controllers and controllers are higher level is standard to have crud type actions on the when they are list the items view a specific edit an new delete an of these actions will require a view sometimes more than you can collect a large number of views if it is a large the way to minimize the code shared functionality to partial as to keep the action views as small and simple as the views and controllers simple so that they are easy to ajax to implement more functionality in one important to point out that any large application is going to have lots of whether mvc or web if there is a lot of data to work there are going to be a lot of forms necessary to do

 wanted to hear some words of advice that will help me to take control over some complicated spaghetti code code that was developed by multiple programmers that never meet each over long the features are just patched on top of each i tend to see 2 kinds of those guys will not touch anything that they have they will probably will complete the maintenance task using a quick and dirty fixes that will make the next programmer to start looking for their home address hope you will never see this code those will probably rewrite the whole code while completely refurbishing its someone has to do the dirty longer time and probably one of the most critical features will magically disappear from the will be nice to hear your personal experience from this darker side of the am specifically curious to hear any advice that will help me to dive into the spaghetti maintenance task without feeling so to save my sanity while maintaining spaghetti

 was gonna make this a but it got too seems to have hit on an important though not strongly enough in my are lots of criteria you might use to describe will it be used in a long running app or winforms app or is it a server or client library or standalone etc to me that if your code will run in a standalone app and you have control over all the surrounding then you can roll your own thread start your own and measure and manage the cost around thread thread and resource or you could use the but it kill your app either you are free to the other hand if your code is packaged as a library that may be used in a server or maybe in a sql clr or a wcf service then it is a really bad idea to create you need to use or some other mechanism that exploits the thread pool if it is to be used in apps with other once quwi is imagine that every library wanting to take advantage of computers rolled their own there would be complete chaos in apps that used more than a few rampant all competing for the same no central coordination of vs hygeine that a whether it is to be consumed in client apps or server uses the common and that means thing to realize is managed thread is either a background thread or a foreground background threads are identical to foreground threads with one a background thread does not keep the managed execution environment once all foreground threads have been stopped in a managed process the file is a managed the system stops all background threads and shuts that belong to the managed thread pool threads whose isthreadpoolthread property is are background all threads that enter the managed execution environment from unmanaged code are marked as background all threads generated by creating and starting a new thread object are by default foreground you use a thread to monitor an such as a socket set its isbackground property to true so that the thread does not prevent your process from the

 was initially going to say that i like when developers declare methods private as it needlessly places limits on anyone who would like to use their most developers would rather write their own class than attempt to use a class that is hard to use adapt to their which is what you would think a private method would but then i realized that it is really sealed classes that are more likely to cause this i gave it some thought and having a hard time thinking of good uses for protected methods than for something like the template so i looked at code from some old projects and i see if i create a method it is because simplifying a public method by creating helper i certainly want anyone to be able to change the helper method as that will almost certainly break my public be interested in knowing if there was a specific example that brought this topic up that we could or maybe someone has a good example is not the template of a good use of protected

 was wondering if it is possible to include svg content inside a panel whatever would work in be able to add more to the svg add a circle or a programmatically and handle mouse events this be in svg or tried creating an html object adding something along the lines work visible in but not sure if it was because i did it wrong or not was able to do a simple example in gwt with google linechart but like to move away from google visualization and be able to generate the svg myself and customize it looked around and many resources points to using canvas but not sure if the best route also a bit baffled about the example i tried a simple of it to try locally and it seem to work at i was however able to get another sample working with just htm with src pointing to svg l separate svg file but i been able to access it using gwt using read about svg not working with hosted browser and compiling it does work but i am uncertain how to refer to the svg i have placed into the html via if i can access it then presumably i can add to its tried in but that seem to work or did i mess guess the goal is to be able to manipulate a svg file which i linked somehow in gwt or in and be able to modify it based on been programming functionality inside of the actual svg in our our svg is an embedded object and we passed to the embedded passing information from an embed object to and from html is quite doable since the html has access to our svg functions and the svg has access to the are more transparent ways of doing so where firebug could see the svg directly which is nice but now not quite thus i think any of the solutions looked at were iframes but i could be a little svg can be pretty slow would say my issue is solved but not using nor gwt at the moment but the method i described in my answer should still work if i want to use svg in

 way should and is probably the best way to do make sure you made the proper connection in interface builder after you declared them in the	
 way supposed to form the version is like first number is the interface version of the whenever you change the public this number goes second number is the revision number of the current whenever you make an internal change without changing the public this number goes third number is a build it is the this tells you how many interfaces are so for example if interface version 4 is strictly a superset of interfaces 3 and but totally incompatible with then the lowest interface number the x and z numbers are very important for the system to determine if a given app can use a given given what the app was compiled the y number is mainly for tracking bug	
 way that you should set up your development should be as your normal development in labwindows source use and for your interface to use i have been using tortisesvn with vs2008 and vs2005 for a while and i find that it is just your normal development in vs2005 or vs2008 and link to the measurement studio libraries supplied by national you will have the option of using or whatever your heart you can also integrate other libraries or such as and you would get the added benefit of framing your questions in terms of microsoft technologies vs national instruments where the support is much can integrate subversion with visual studio through a number of addons but i prefer to use 2 is nice because you are able to use the best of all visual studio measurement studio roll your tortisesvn

 way to solve your problem is to attach a guid or similar type of data to a user and check for a valid session when the page is if there is you redirect to a page saying that this url is not available at the and that the user will soon be redirected then redirect to home after 5 seconds or so using it would work like the user is a session cookie is created with for example a the is also stored in a database in which you have one column for the primary key and one for the you also create an authentication thus logging the user on to your all datacalls etc are the user has been successfully registered and so you redirect to the confirmation the confirmation page is the user is automatically logged on you created the authentication cookie in step you can then check for a row in the table corresponding to the logged on if there is such a you delete the and display the confirmation page with all the if there is no such you display the error message and as you deleted the row when you showed the message the first the user will not be able to access the confirmation page if you use this approach some other that makes the confirmation page available only you should make sure that it is clearly stated on the confirmation page that the user be able to access that page

 what do you plan on doing with this is a windbg which can get you this if you need code to do scripting the debugger will probably be much more reliable to get this return this information to you on its since it has no idea why user mode code requested the you need to use it with other information sources to get this and there may still be some error you should filter only by memory and static allocations been should fall within that allocations should be at an address with a loaded you can use psapi to determine if the address is within a loaded for calling enumprocessmodules and then you can use the toolhelp api to determine if the memory location is in a createtoolhelp32snapshot with to get threads in the target then getthreadcontext and check if the resulting stack pointer is within the know of a good way to walk heaps from outside the toolhelp snaps a heap list but give you a good set of bounds for the heap from within the you can use getprocessheaps to walk the list of and then call heapvalidate to dtermie if the memory location is within the

 while ago we started developing a new project which internally has about different that are heavily related to each other either via or then we went with a native oodbms system basically because what it allowed us to do was to take our object model and simply add a few persistence related here and there and we were ready to over time we ran into more and more really a reasonable limitations that forced us to implement slow workarounds resulting in mediocre performance and scalability issues on the horizon and license fees have almost increased by a factor of 5 for us with no change on our end got bought by big currently starting to look for a solution in terms of as well as we had a look at other and always came across major breakers for us and therefore we started to look a little further and basically are thinking about orms which hopefully let us keep most of the focus on our objects instead of wrangling with basically my does anyone have any experience with entity framework or any other orm that keeps configuration as maintainable as possible as well as performs well in related the amount of data we store is not amazing or extensive in any sort expect a total of 100k instances across all entities within the next 3 anyone have any for an orm experience migrating from an oodbms to from oodbms to orm framework sql

 will soon work on a project about a mobile application will work on a pdt with windows mobile and we will use visual studio and to developp application will intensively use wifi and need to consume as little power as found on the internet a lot of stuff concerning embedded software and real time which deal with power but this stuff is very hardware and does not talk about software also found some interesting best practices but that mainly focus on the code of the application close handles as soon as possible or use few would like to know if you are aware of some leads concerning the architecture or the design of such also saw advice about the use of event driven is it so useful concerning power saving and is it usable with the compact framework for your so dave gave us some that we could call architecture i think i see clearly what could be done at two differents a such decisions as a low level of close to the tricks and tips that minimize the battery about at a middle level of abstraction the design is there some methodology for software design what so to design a less power consuming mobile	
 will take several weeks to change over to a new or a of you have to get away from old forms way of thinking web in that many pages we over 300 that would be you change the view of your entire you shift from old thinking of page need to create to the mvc way of thinking of function do we need to implement i myself took control of a project that has over 3300 files in the project alone the 11 supporting one thing that i am architecting is how mvc will drastically cut down the number of physical files down to around 310 or because i am moving away from one another to a the function i want to way of looking at pages as the function you are trying to you instead start abstracting pieces of that page out into common can greatly scale with this because now you have a template for the way you want it to you just need to implement another to change the look of that view you want to no 2nd no additional as for web as you this calls for a different way of there is the htmlhelper that is used for basic rendering and i use the same concept with an abstracted class called myprojecthelper that renders my onto the page i always created a server control for my displaynames in the this allowed me to control the way that displayname was especially with a switch to facebook connect and other with i no longer use a but a on a viewmodel to render that since this is only part of the ui this will render the anchor as needed with any options i wish the abstract is inherited by the collegeprojectviewmodel that picks up on the text power lies in the ability to no longer require a but instead or methods of what you want to do with your by changing to this way of you really can scale with as many method you create on your it really speeds things up on a mass scale

 windows console follows the same line ending convention that is assumed for or for that matter for physical it needs to see both cr and lf to properly move to the next there is a lot of software infrastructure between an ansi c program and that in any standard c library function is going to try to do the right assuming allowed it the this is why and modifiers for the parameter were default for most and in particular for and then any printed is converted to a crlf and the reverse happens for to turn off that use the the terminals traditionally hooked to boxes including the dec vt100 emulated by xterm also needs both cr and in the the conversion from a newline character to a crlf sequence is handled in the tty device driver so most programs need to know about and the and modifiers are both on those if you need to send and receive characters on a tty without that you need to look up or the system calls it depends your otherwise ansi c program is avoiding c library to the console because you need access to the character color and other then whether you need to send cr or not will depend on which win32 api calls you are using to send the

 with you are forced to use that or if your program has a structure some country them change that list thilos answer will be the best way to do if you combine it with the advice from hawtin you with a you are free to and if your application might get more then you might change your code to use a treeset this kind of collection sorts your entries just when they are no need to call countrynames new note on why i prefer the has some but important simply only one line worry about this list really sorted right becaude a treeset is always no matter what you cannot have duplicate depending on your situation this may be a pro or a if you need stick to your experienced programmer looks at and instantly is a sorted collection of strings without and i can be sure that this is true at every so much information in a short performance win in some if you use a and insert values very and the list may be read between those then you have to sort the list after every the set does the but does it much the right collection for the right task is a key to write short and bug free not as demonstrative in this because you just save one but stopped counting how often i see someone using a list when they want to ensure there are no and then build that functionality or even using two lists when you really need a get me using is not an error or a but there are many cases when the treeset is much

 wonder how people are kicking people out or blocking access to a site when you want to do an upgrade and you have users that are logged one thought is to just put a bool setting in a global file as the settings for whether or not the site is true is while false is when the next time the user attempts to access the site they will either be logged out or just presented with an unavailable are 2 issues i can see with this users are just finishing filling in a long form or writing a large portion of text a new question or answer on as soon as they submit the lose that always save because there maybe db changes for that table or code may have changed on a busy editing the global file if more than a couple lines it might cause php parse errors if that page is loaded while partially uploaded or while there might also be locking issues on the depending on the option is to have a field in the database with the same at the i generally have a table for so this would be the only thing in the but i could see it being faster as it avoids the second there something that used that worked well or any other working with is the best method for taking a site down and kicking out users to do an

 working on a project which is in serious need of some performance do i write a test that fails if my optimizations do not in improve the speed of the elaborate a problem is not discovering which parts to i can use various profiling and benchmarking tools for problem is using tests to document that a specific optimization did indeed have the intended it would also be highly desirable if i could use the test suite to discover possible performance regressions later suppose i could just run my profiling tools to get some values and then assert that my optimized code produces better the obvious problem with is that benchmarking values are not hard they vary with the local is the answer to always use the same machine to do this kind of integration if you would still have to allow for some fuzziness in the since even on the same hardware benchmarking results can how then to take this into maybe the answer is to keep older versions of the program and compare results before and this would be my preferred since mostly environment does anyone have experience with this i imagine it would only be necessary to keep one older version if all the tests can be made to pass if the performance of the latest version is at least as good as the former testing best practices when doing

 works really well for projects based on mvc using it on a couple of projects at the moment and finding it a very good fit with an implementation of the record that uses nhibernate under the hood in other as long as happy having one class per database do most of the nhibernate configuration for leaving you free to write code bob customer id goes here newinvoice new product id goes here very little explicit nhibernate configuration you have invoice and product tables in your of nhibernate under the migrating to nhibernate if you need to should be straightforward already have all the necessary references and there are a few aspects of nhibernate behaviour that you ignore scopes and but not too hard to work out going on with and using them in activerecord will give you a head start you need to move to using nhibernate

 would agree that individual tables is it is more scalable and better for query if in future the users want more columns on a particular lookup then you can add the application will have to create tables and constraints i normally do but then this application is already altering existing tables and adding columns to which i normally do

 would also guess that for reasoning has alot less weight with the big sites because big they get the lions share of the traffic has all the seo rank because there are so many other places that point to reasons apply to other large doesnt give a damn about seo friendly urls if following the you already know about the and most roads lead there being the or site for something means a large amount of the seo rank flows to you regardless of your url choice because links on other sites will likely go to you as pointed they bigger sites are often older ones that carry alot of historical and migration to new urls can be a large amount of effort that is harder to

 would argue that for most programmers and does not present a significant advantage or potential over standard multithreaded most people have threads to accomplish sequential and there that much potential for splitting up those threads to much smaller most benefits of would come from improvements to underlying frameworks database gui and 3d and the vast majority of developers would benefit future static analysis tools may be able to recommend pieces that could be split further into

 would be best to try and match any character that is not allowed by negating the allowed for if you only wanted to allow through you might do the cannot possibly know of the characters that are but you presumably know the ones that are build a regular expression like the one above that matches only one character that is not in the allowed if you get a know that the string contains an invalid you try to use character class escape codes if them for re look for classes and other special it may allow you to have a shorter expression like this individual	
 would be better than you really need a dictionary for each since column names are the same for all and if you want to have it you should use column indexes instead of if you have a column that is a 3rd to get its value from a row id the code would val option is depending on the way you access the data only or random could also use from the memory usage i think the best option would be to use a single dimension array with some slack so after say you would create a new copy the old contents to it and leave 100 empty rows at the but you would have to keep some sort of an index when you delete a so that it is marked as deleted without resizing the

 would be the principal benefit on my winforms designer has received several usability improvements since text alignment guidelines being one of my i would ask why you move all the way to for moving to the latest but a used for several years before moving briefly to and recently to i cannot understate the profound benefits seen from the use of linq syntax when querying and processing any sort of data that exists in a list collection the most readable information found on linq is at you are planning to just get your application building in a newer version of and then use the infragistics control suite then you might not be able to take advantage of the language additions in but giving yourself the opportunity to do so in the future makes sense to

 would consider using a approach for all the extended essentially you define your static data from year over this will be things like company the definition of an address for example change year after these will be modled you would define a table that will contain a master of all the questions you and will be linked somehow to tell you what year those questions are valid this table might also indicate other attributes about the question that could let you dynamically create a gui on top of things such as regular expressions to validate the type of data a really naive approach which even after doing this would not be the end state of what i would model would probally have another table the correlates a year to a and this is what i would link the company this way we can reuse questions over and i have a picture to go along with tihs need to find a place to upload it edit soon as i get that

 would discourage you from trying the problem is that in order to make regions guaranteed to be you need a very sophisticated type sure looked at the papers by tofte and talpin and you have an idea of the complexities even if you do get regions working the chances are very hight that your program will require a whose lifetime is the lifetime of the that region at least has to be garbage is why cyclone has regions just getting encourage you to go with garbage modern garbage collectors can be made pretty fast without a lot of the main issue is to allocate from contiguous free space so that allocation is it helps to be targeting amd64 or other machine with spare registers so you can use a hardware register as the allocation are lots of good ideas to one of the easiest to implement is a collector like joel where the idea is you allocate only from completely empty you want to study existing garbage has a fairly sophisticated incremental garbage collector there are no visible pause and the implementation is only 700 it is fast enough to be used in a lot of where performance

 would like to build on a this is what is known more generally as the idea is the first code is the it tells you how to interpret the the second code is the which tells you how many bytes there are in the this is a great way to do extensible binary encoding and is used a lot in mpeg would add in a few more on a good functional binary a in each message that states the protocol version for the every field in byte consider the size of each using a encoding scheme for i find a good but the idea is that the top bit is 1 if there are more bytes and 0 if this is the last byte and the lower seven bits in each byte contains the everything on to the wire as bytes and never first one is really it is more important that you plan for change and carefully decide how the protocol will clients should never attempt to interpret a message if they support the version fifth one is pretty important when it comes to having a stable written quite a few binary protocol implementations for embedded devices and using packed structures is the mistake that i regret the i have had too many defects related to forgetting to byte swap a numeric field or not packing a just write a nice library of byte packing and unpacking test it and use it you design and implement the protocol with these principles in it will make your life a lot easier when you have to support and the last thing that i would highly recommend is writing a dissector for something like for your it will also make and supporting things easier as just make sure to completely understand the possible legal implications of writing such a dissector as well as deploying one before you consider

 would make it a static member of the reason is that making it public static is saying something about the not only that type knows how to do this but also is the responsibility of this type to perform this and odds are the behavior no longer has any real relationship with the larger mean i make it static at ask yourself could the new method logically belong if you can answer to you probably do want to make it static move it as even if not you could still make it just mark it a matter of you could at least mark it this typically avoids needing to move the method if you have easy access to a more appropriate but still leaves it accessible where needed in a way that it show up as part of the public interface to users of your

 would not use a sql you can easy describe every 3d object with an xml pack this files in a directory and pack if you need easy access to the meta data of the you can generate an index file with name or so not all objects must be parsed and loaded to memory if you have something like a library are quick and easy sax parsers available and you can easy write a xml writer found some free code you can use for similar applications using xml its easy to human readable and needs not much space if have used its easy to use and easy to integrate with own but i would prefer a sql database like sqlite more for applications where you need some good searching tools for a huge amount of data

 would probably be better to build a dynamic query in your code with all the joins you customized to each individual parameterized for security of would use much of the same cascading logic you have now but you move it to to the code instead of the then you only submit the exact query you performance would beat using all of the temp tables and you might get some caching benefit after a few queries were

 would probably write some sort of command line tool or service that does the processing and extraction of project then i would use a page to projects that the web server and the command line tool both have common access then at specified times either manually or via cron or similar mechanisms extract the data to your once you have you just use the website to display last extraction times and the extracted the users are on a different subnet then you will need the end users to run the tool and then have it post the data into the

 would really recommend using a javascript framework when dealing with ajax that way you have to get into the intricaties of each my personal favorite is when it comes to you have two is only available as xml use a can be retrieved as json using when it comes to a web recommend jsonp for its things can get tricky in case of error again for recommend the following	
 would recommend a 3rd option and that is to add a distinct clause to your 2nd option and give that a would vote for the 2nd option as being more efficient with the distinct clause you have hopefully added an index on in both just noticed a trick question there is no field in more than one teacher can teach a course add a table always avoid plurals in object names just a in this new table store the teachercourseid generated and the and you can allow more than one teacher per	
 would recommend an incremental each frame find a contiguous block of inuse memory that has free space on both sides and move it in whichever direction will allow it to or you could just move all blocks in one find a gap and a inuse block that is the best fit for it and move on the 360 you should probably use a thread to do the while on the ps3 it would be best to use the gpu to move the data around for	
 would recommend not lightweight but very good	
 would recommend starting with the absolute core parts of learn about the type collections personally do this with console where you need nearly as much code to get a result as with a and you can concentrate on the topic trying to learn terms of in a is very if really not a console kind of first may be up your street not my preferred but many other people like make sure you get the latest as lots of errors have been

 would say answer is a pretty good have looked at rails and all three inhabit the same with flex producing flash rias and gwt and rails doing the same for worked with there is a lot to like but some serious niggling the main one for me being the difficulty integrating html into a flex app no trivial task and there are few projects that can avoid on the other hand is daunting initially because and does not come with the same kind of drag and drop editor that flex provides in flex gwt designer is a pretty good equivalent to flex builder in the gwt world and for a java programmer with swing the architecture of gwt take much figuring to mention the sheer number of java programmers around who can pitch gwt to their managers as a simple their existing java the google brand terms of sellability within the a java tool is always going to be an easier sell than actionscript or ruby on hard to say for sure where things are headed but i would expect to see continued growth for all everyone wants ria these

 would say that for normal tdd works extremely there are cases where you may not need to write the tests first even at but those are you need to do some exploration to see what will i would consider this to be a and i necessarily think that tdd is absolutely necessary in this i would probably not use the actual code in my after it was just an exploration and now that i have a better idea of how it ought to i can probably write better code than my if i did decide to use my probably go back and write tests for if you find that violated tdd and written some production code before your tests it happens go back and write the in on the occasions where this has happened to me often found things that neglected once i start writing the tests because more tests come to mind that handled by the you get back in the tdd rythym vow never to do that	
 would say that in most cases the data is not suitable for ui why you almost always put a a layer of logic in between to interpret the db information to the another thing is that when you generate the ui from db you will end up displaying the inner workings of the something that you normally want to it depends on where the db came if it was created to exactly reflect what the users goals of the system if the users mental model of what the application should help them with is stored in the then it might just but then you to start at the users if not i suggest you go that	
 would say that the library should be independent of user this case the in that having a dependency on a config file is not so do want the connectionstring in the of your but you want to pass it to the library through a parameter at some this would allow you to use the same library in a non web also it would allow you to implement different ways to get the connectionstring a webservice	
 would say yes they are your code is exactly equivalent x and x output if x and x output if x and x output if x and x output that only changed the when a language evaluates it tests each one until it finds the true clause it hits the final the nested evaluate in exactly the same also note that this necessarily the case if there is an explicit more thing i the following is to your x and x output x and x output x and x output x and x output nesting is to keep all of the text from being output when all of the conditions are

 would suggest looking into if you designed for versioning configuration files in using a version control is a collection of tools let be stored in a or bzr it hooks into apt other managers including yum and to automatically commit changes to during package tracks file metadata that control systems do not but that is important such as the permissions quite modular while also being to use if you understand the basics working with revision designed for i think it would probably also work well with some for home directories since the basic needs are the

 would try soring the uniques in an unbalanced binary save you the cost of rearranging the uniques and if the source list is random the insertions into the tree unbalance it you can do a all in one go with a binary if it does become worst case would be the same as iterating over a 16 element list instead of doing the binary know the max size of the binary so you can preallocate all the necessary memory ahead of so that be an you could even use the run out of memory for condition to let you know when apparently folks think advocating using exceptions i might be advocating actual common but not the style exceptions found in most it looks like he wants to do c for

 written a few of these a couple of things you should as mentioned by you want some kind of this is important for a number of but the main one is that it gives you additional flexibility in case your servers going and you decide users should be credited with an additional day of free just push back their value by a this also makes free trials simple to use stuff like automated recurring even if working on a subscription you want to be in full control over when the payment gets and offloading that responsibility to your gateway is just a bad idea in most most gateways will allow you to store a credit card on their give you back an id for that and you can issue charges against that intermediate id instead of the card log all i overemphasize this in you should probably expose this log to the user as basically just a table of all of the payments the and the final common to put invoices into this table as invoices have a positive payments and credits have a negative and just sum everything for the user to obtain the final you can introduce arbitrary credits to this table very easily if so a cron script that fires every 24 hours that checks what users need to have an invoice this cron script should have three critical if it run for some you lose a worth of if it runs more than once in a or if it gets aborted through and it charge people and if the date on the server gets changed to 2090 by it automatically bill all of your users for millions of resets to dates in the past jan should also cause it to raise daylight in my is rarely an think that covers most of the big but there are always little gotchas in billing systems that you have to watch out

 wrote this answer back in when android was relatively and there were many not well established areas in android i have added a long addendum at the bottom of this addressing some and detailing a large philosophical disagreement i have with those who encourage the use of singletons rather than subclassing read it at your own more general problem you are encountering is how to save state across several activities and all parts of your a static variable a is a common java way of achieving i have found that a more elegant way in android is to associate your state with the application you each activity is also a which is information about its execution environment in the broadest your application also has a and android guarantees that it will exist as a single instance across your way to do this is to create your own subclass of and then specify that class in the application tag in your now android will automatically create an instance of that class and make it available for your entire you can access it from any using the method also provides a method which has the exact same myapp extends application private string public string return public void mystate blah extends activity public void myapp appstate string state has essentially the same effect as using a static variable or but integrates quite well into the existing android note that this will not work across processes your app be one of the rare ones that has multiple also as anticafe in order to correctly tie your application override to your application a tag is necessary in the manifest see the android docs for more an user608578 asks below how this works with managing native object i admit i am not up to speed on using native code with android in the and i am not qualified to answer how that would interact with my if someone does have an answer to i am willing to credit them and put the information in this post for maximum some people have this is a solution for something i perhaps should have emphasized more in the original this is not meant to be a solution for saving user or other information that is meant to be persisted across application i consider most criticism below related to applications being killed at any as anything that ever needed to be persisted to disk should not be stored through an application it is meant to be a solution for storing easily application state a user is logged in for and components which are single instance network manager for in has been kind enough to point out an interesting with reto meier and diane in which use of application subclasses is discouraged in favor of singleton somatik also pointed out something of this nature although i see it at the because of reto and roles in maintaining the android i cannot in good faith recommend ignoring their what they to a certain i do wish to disagree extremely strongly with the diane in expressed with regards to preferring singleton over application in my disagreement i will be making use of concepts best explained in stackexchange explanation of the singleton design so that i do not have to define terms in this i highly encourage skimming the link before point by states the is no reason to subclass from it is no different than making a this first claim is there are two main reasons for the application class provides a better lifetime guarantee for an application it is guaranteed to have the lifetime of the a singleton is not explicitly tied to the lifetime of the application it is this may be a for your average application but i would argue this is exactly the type of contract the android api should be and it provides much more flexibility to the android system as by minimizing the lifetime of associated the application class provides the application developer with a single instance holder for which is very different from a singleton holder of for a list of the see the singleton explanation link likely to be something you regret in the future as you find your application object becoming this big tangled mess of what should be independent application this is certainly not but this is not a reason for choosing singleton over application in fact it is telling to me that none of arguments provide a single reason that using a singleton is better than an application all she attempts to establish is that using a singleton is no worse than an application which i believe is also comments that using an application subclass is likely to be something you regret in the future as you find your application object becoming this big tangled mess of what should be independent application as before this is not but only further points out that there is no concrete benefit to using a singleton instead of an application subclass in this she this leads more naturally to how you should be managing these things initializing them on this ignores the fact that there is no reason you cannot initialize on demand using an application subclass as again there is no ends with framework itself has tons and tons of singletons for all the little shared data it maintains for the such as caches of loaded pools of it works i am not arguing that using singletons cannot work fine or are not a legitimate i am arguing that singletons do not provide as strong a contract with the android system as using an application and further that using singletons generally points to extremely inflexible which is not easily and leads to many problems down the the strong contract the android api offers to developer applications is one of the most appealing and pleasing aspects of programming with and helped lead to early developer adoption which drove the android platform to the success it has suggesting using singletons is implicitly moving away from a strong api and in my weakens the android that diane has not explained a single downside to using an application and has not proven that using a singleton is better in any i cannot agree with any of her it may be that she has not fully explained her but i cannot see any downside to using an application subclass which would counter the numerous downsides to i do not argue that singletons cannot work but i do argue that they are generally the product of either a bad api or a lazy i disagree quite strongly with which i feel is a terrible basis for an i leave you with the following list of downsides to as stolen from the stackexchange to use abstract or interface to coupling across the application to to test in unit to parallelize in the case of mutable state extensive add my and unmanageable lifetime contract unsuited for android most

 you apply some ddd logic which compliments the in the state of the ui belongs in the application which can talk directly with the domain and infrastructure layers and the concept of ddd makes you about how to solve the solution in code step through the progress state you want to maintain here is the step or progress of the my first step would be to document progress or such step get step get in this i would apply logic to the model to the next most likely with a method on the a registrationservice but it belongs in the app would create a service in the application layer called i would place a method on here called but the domain would not hold the state of the model in this want to focus the state at the application so in this would act upon not a model object it is not part of the domain but instead the you need something to retain the state of the registration away from the domain how about a now we know we have to retain the state of something in the mvc allows for a concept called viewmodels not sure what ror calls a viewmodel represents the model that will be displayed by the partial viewmodel would be an excellent place to save the state of this call and stick a method on of means that the application layer would have to retain the location of the and the application layer would change the internals of it based on nextstep if it is you may want to create a in the application layer and place the within it to abstract your logic to pass the viewmodel final piece is how to track the state of that since web applications are you have to retain control by some other means then the in this i would revert to serializing the viewmodel to the client and letting the client pass it back and or keep a copy of the and pass some type of identifier back and forth to the client and is a good example to think as i have not performed this myself for the most secure and insured way of saving the state of this viewmodel is to persist it to the via the infrastructure layer the app layer can talk directly to the infrastructure that seems a lot of work to for something that may die off and i would have partial registrations sitting in my would keep the private info cc all on the server side and not pass it back and an after walking through we came up a in the application a with a in the application is persist the viewmodel to the database through the infrastructure you never have to track what on the view or ui as the viewmodel gets updated and updated persisted to as you move your next concern would be to in the this is easily done with 1 using step or named but i am writing code below as that is my class registrationcontroller public actionresult return and this posts back to note the setting of property on the model public actionresult registrationprogressviewmodel the logic in here checks business rules around the verifies if valid it increases and finally the viewmodel to the db through the switch case wire up the view for step2 return case wire up the view for step3 return case wire up the view for step4 return return to first return notice that this abstracts the of verifying the internal state into the the your url is a nice and clean post which expects a viewmodel with specific properties filled if the viewmodel is not does not advance to the next

 you can assume that there is some constraints regarding the then you might be able to get away with knowing less for if your shape was the composition of a small square with a long thin triangle on one side a simple symmetrical then you could compare the distance from each list point to the of the largest distance would identify the tip of the the second largest would be the two points farthest from the tip of the if there was some order to the like points are entered in counter clockwise order the you could identify all the this sounds like a bit of so it might be reasonable to try to include some extra info with your like the of and a reference point that is located above the com not along the this will give you an vector that you can cross with the normal to define some body for the normal can be defined by an ordering of the point if you assume anything about the shapes even if the shapes were for then you will need more it depends on your	
 you can best fragement depends on the file concurrently open a large number of opening a file will create a new directory entry but cause a block to be written for that but now go through each file in writing one this typically will cause the next free block to be which will lead to all your files being fragmented with regard to each files is another do the but do it on a file copy of existing doing a delete of the original and rename of

 you can do as long as the widths of the elements to be distributed are known in but a bit trick you want a spacing between each element of that is width of the parent element minus the total width of all the child divided equally between the number of gaps between the css have the ability to do we have to hack it a first we add a margin to the parent element of the size the total width of all child so now the parent has width and we can use a padding value in relative to that for for four images of sizes 40px and 80px our is set that as the parent then the children can have of that width as padding between funny tag indentation is to avoid there being any whitespace between is necessary because with the parent width set narrower than the page it otherwise be possible to fit all the elements on the in ie you may need to add a wrapper div around the lot with to prevent unwanted scrollbars if spanning the whole and certainly want to be in standards can work with textual elements if you make them inline blocks so you can add and you size them explicitly in it work if the sizes of the child elements are not known in advance they contain dynamic as you know the value to be honest i would probably just use a the table layout algorithm copes very smoothly with calculating how to distribute spare table for best results with or to respond to dynamic this way you also have to worry about pixel rounding

 you can do it is a fine practice which must however be considered strongly with respect to the careful not to call methods in the class during the call your class is partially so any call to methods the class itself or could have bad and hard to track as a rule of the constructor must be with respect to the you are using methods of the you have free access to its ask yourself i want to access the class through its or through its better explain the second suppose you have a class a with methods and that calls in its in this case you are talking with the interface of your this interface could not be the one you for suppose that the class has been reimplemented derived from by but also by an user of your and that method has been due to the will call instead of not using the method and accessing the you are guaranteed that your function behaves the even for child of these issues enter in the base class here is very good about

 you have a bunch of electrons being passed around among various atoms inside of your because of the structure of the silicon atoms in your the electrons follow certain which determine the branch of execution the computer will seems i should explain a little less bear with i majored in computer not electrical so i have a very deep understanding of these cpu is made of a a usually which is called a one of the great things about semiconductors is that their elecrical properties can be easily varied through or applying impurities that create areas of negative or positive on the the lines where these areas come together are known as and electricity flows much more easily one way across these junctions than the this property is exploited to create which allow electricity to flow only in one and which can be thought of as tiny switches that allow one electrical current to control another electrical these transistors and diodes are combined in a myriad of ways to create the logic gates of your of the logic gates inside of your cpu are dedicated to being the which is in charge of retrieving and decoding telling the rest of the cpu what to and finally getting the next on the the control unit is actually running which tells it how to deal with and so you really need to be incredibly specific about a particular line of processors to get into how the x86 isa is implemented on a particular

 you have a lot of classes like and want to generically follow inherit from a hasparent interface that has an abstract method and have parents inherit for an interface but other tha following the object graph or by not much you can do with a let me amend i worked on a project where we had a object and because of some poor planning and some requirements sometimes have to reach across the graph to get a datum from an associated componentcost to its parent cost to its parent to its child customsinfo to its child componentcustomsinfo to its lookup table i do the original so frown at method could have made that a little more i put together a set of enums so singleton that did traverse the graph for in a type safe and even elegant having a parent would have made implementing that	
 you have a lot of data in your i would double check that you have indexed all the appropriate because this can make a huge on your local dev you probably have a lot more memory than on your 500 mb which would result in the db running a lot slower if you have un indexed you can also run the slow queries logger in mysql to pinpoint columns without than passenger will need to spool up a process for you if you have not been using the site if this is the you should see a significant speed increase on and especially third and later page	
 you have a small enough using adequately svn commit and exploit them a tool that generates an rss feed trac for can be an easy and efficient way to promote are several requirements for this to which are quite easy to commit frequently is good in as it allows everybody to benefit from each local and to identify problems use verbose comments is good as it allows to trace more easily what was in case anything breaks ensure everybody actually reads keeps posted through an rss the there is no way to to such but if someone really needs to probably between that person and the so mail is usually other useful tool is to ask each developer once a write a 10 or so bullet point list of recommendations for fellow on a topic is really familiar

 you have a very straight forward method signatures methods that takes and returns primitive types such as it is reasonably easy to do so in and still possible but a bit harder in java with if your class methods uses modern programming techniques such as boost shared pointers and stl containers then it is a very different you will need to be really careful with memory management in this is gonna be even more interesting if the method has template arguments because template system is very different from or java generics in that it is only a compile time basically this means the signature of the method or class is different every time you pass a different data type to the template this made the method impossible to wrap in or

 you have a visual studio 2008 solution composed of multiple you can only generate one class diagram per if you have one application project linking to 10 library have to generate 11 separate class are two ways to work around neither of which is all the source into a single a class diagram for one project and then drag files from all the other projects into the class more thorough exploration of the capabilities of the visual studio class designer is given in class the poor support for class diagrams in visual probably better off going with a commercial tool if you want anything more than a simple list of what classes you from excel software might be worth looking and someone i work with uses

 you have the following code do else if do something else this state should never be assume that the applications logic dictates that in this part of the the last state should never be but it is not something that can be determined at compile and maybe there are other states which could be set by other parts of the but which are not used code do you add in the last no because it should not be reached some logging so that you as a developer know that some illegal state has been an because the state must not be reached and if it is reached something else must be first option seem reasonable to something goes right seems hardly the right option two has the advantage that your app crash right so if this happens in a rare occasion which was not caught in the customer can continu using the application and the developer is notified of the option three causes the app to which obviously is not something you want your customers to but it does make it very clear that something is is the best way to handle such a based on additional consideration to steer the contract of the method that contains the above code does not allow any other values to be set at that moment then on and that the code is in a part of the to handle an invalid execution	
 you have the luxury of being able to scan the entire input before starting to compress you could choose the least frequent value in the input as your escape given this could choose as your escape value even if part of your symbol and adopt a convention whereby the first character of the encoded stream is the escape so the string above might encode even note that no point in encoding a of two identical values because the version is longer than the uncompressed version that

 you it depends on a not just the site you want to but comparing it to give you a rough i host a site that gets from 20k to 30k pageviews a day on app and it costs me 17c a for extra storage over the default quota all other quotas are well within the free far as specific comparisons if we look at for their base plan is for 12gb of storage and 120gb transfer per at app engine that would cost you at most per month assuming it was all outgoing if you do less than that in a it costs you you have all the versatility on app engine that you have with a but you also have better scalability and comparison is fairly easy to other hosting i think app engine will generally come out so mostly the decision comes down to if your app is suitable for app

 you know what the operation aborted error a microsoft kb article about also tonnes of posts about it but the simple answer for occurrence is the error only occurs if you try to manipulate a dom element via javascript before the element you are trying to manipulate is know how internet infamous operation aborted occurs and know how to fix the problem i have is a very weird testing locally and on a development machine with i never ever get the operation aborted error sites running as on our testing site it occurs all the unfortunately my testing environment is not the same as the testing so that adds some variables to the but the main difference i see is that the testing site is using anyone ever had the operation aborted error only for an ssl other thought that popped in my head was that it was a latency locally the site loads up almost instantaneously whereas on my testing the page loads so with that in i got fiddler running and simulated the performance to run at old school modem still no operation aborted error locally or on our own testing the site is an site using ajax extensions the page with the issue also has the ajax control cascading drop down on yes as far as i can tell all javascript that manipulates the dom is at the end of the not the help or comments is greatly operation aborted and latency

 you look at the game or simulator industry you find a lot of plus maybe some added scripting there can also be tools written in other languages for scenery design or related but there is only very little lisp used in that you need to be a good hacker to get the necessary performance out of lisp and to be able to access or write the how do you get this fail there is nothing but writing code and experimenting with lisp is really useful for good software engineers or those that have the potential to be a good software of the main obstacles is the either you have a very simple one you have a performance problem with random or you have a sophisticated one you have a problem getting it working only few garbage collectors exist that would be suitable most lisp implementations have good gc but still those are not tuned for or near exceptions do with you can forget the because there usually is other alternative to automatic memory management with a garbage collector is to use no gc and manage memory this is used by some lisp applications that need to support some response example process control expert nearest thing that was developed in that area was the also later game for the playstation i games were for the playstation from naughty since they have been bought by they switched to for the playstation their development environment was written in allegro common lisp and it included a compiler for a scheme lisp on the development system the code gets compiled and then downloaded to the playstation during they had their own 3d engine always got excellent reviews from game incremental level complex behaviour control for lots of different so the playstation was really executing the scheme but memory management was not done via gc they had to develop all the technology on their own nobody was offering tools but they because their were excellent software since then i heard of a similar note that this was not just lisp for scripting it was lisp all the way the scheme side there is also a new interesting implementation called it is developed for a pinball game this could be the base for other the common lisp there have been lisp applications talking to flight simulators and controlling aspects of there are some game libraries that are based on there are interfaces to there is also something like the agent there are also some 3d graphics applications written in common lisp even some complex but in the area of flight simulation there is very little prior the topic of clos functional probably one would use if you need to squeeze all possible performance out of a then clos already has some overheads that one might want to

 you may consider turning to is web toolkit believe it supports all the browsers you are interested and gives you the ability to code your ui in a ide such as the advantage of this is you can use ide tools for code completion and error which greatly improves development on ui you use gwt ui it will hide a lot of nastiness from having to be dealt but when you will create a deploy file for each browser this way you never download any code if you are viewing the app in you will also have a stub generated which will load the appropriate compiled bundle of to sweeten the these files are so perceived performance is generally improved for returning

 you mean something like navigating by selecting an item of a you could do the form configured with a that points directly to the target js is have the be called when selecting the if no js is a button should be allowing the user to still work with the the approach above goes directly to the target this is different than sending a redirect from the which incurs in an extra request to be adds extra delay to the operation and more requests to be handled by the this is a navigate there is no need to go server side for this least not without additional specific

 you mentioned you already tried position but tried the following and it might work for here is the 0 the menu is positioned independent of the other ie puts the menu relative to the and hides it behind the the work around is to position it just as many to the left as the content div has but this should only done for so therefor the 0 is added before the negative which works because ie ignores while the other browers do acknowledge it and will use alohci notes a better way would be to use the in that case the css for html

 you need to just open it in and the server need to be why not use a long uris over the network is basically never the right thing to as you some web hosts support long some proxy servers may also choke on long which means that your app might not work for users who are behind those if you ever need to port your app to a different other browsers may not support uris that you need to get data up to a use a an extra round but it will be much more if you are uploading data to the server using a get then you are vulnerable to all kinds of request an attacker can trick the user into goatse to their account simply by getting them to click on a link hidden by or another url shortening or just embedded as a link in a web page when they look closely at the url clicking should never use get for sending data to the beyond query parameters that actually change anything on the

 you need to post the data use one easy option is to create a form element on the attach input elements with the values you need and submit you can do that like so if you use var get the mail id of this not sure where since i have the html that makes if let me very first line is a jquery shortcut way of saying the document is done when the page is done going to attach an event listener to elements in the when one of those elements is we can then extract the mail id whatever else you that is in relation to that particular table if you had html like 8435 is the mail id in this we could extract the variable like we are going to attach a hidden form element to the end of the body of the html really matter where we put it since it is the end is in this form we set the method to post and the action to whatever php file you need to post i also set an id so easily referred to in the next now going to select the form element using its id and going to append a new hidden input element to it with the appropriate name value going to use the javascript submit method to trigger the submit event on the this is basically equivalent to pressing the button on a normal it it should work

 you need to use instead of latter would need an iterator as you use a slightly different loop it current can even overcome the problem mentioned of a logic object during invalidate iterators except of the ones pointing to the removed from i also vote for this being a variation of the singleton and i would suggest for keeping the original solution with a separate management just in case you want to have to have two loops with different delta times or explicit multithread support logic objects on different or whatever in the my opinion this is a general advantage of the singleton class over static methods you could always you can easily multiply your functionality if you want to do so in the future

 you really do insist on this function prototype not following the other suggestions here of passing an array or a list which are you can use something like that bool can be used to access the ith print the 4th change the value of the the if you really need to change the passed you should not pass them by passing a bool by reference only wastes time and it would also make the code here a bit less

 you really need to represent the subscription level in the user why you add a subscription type in your relation would then be expressed a user has one it could also be modeled as a relationship if you wish to keep an history of when you want to change the subscription level of a instead of instantiating a new user you would create a new subscription and assign it to a when you user signs when he upgrades to a paying a trialuser really that different from a probably you would be better served with aggregation instead of subscription data can be stored in a separate table as an or it can be stored inside the users table as a

 you rewrite you current code so that it can be unit tested according all guidelines and that can be and you should estimate the cost and compare that the earnings is that you might discover a problem with the code and if done the reduction of the complexity as the result of the factors might save some time in the cost is the time and effort you have to spend both refactor your the test cases and also the extra time you might have to spend in the maintain the and the mocking code and that can be significant are comparing a known cost against a future risk and i am sure a lot of smart guys knows how to do but obvious that you can actually spend an infinite time refactoring and mocking without ever reducing the risk of failure to zero even at all if the code and problem is complex and you are messing things up when so you need to find a balance this as the code is it might be ok to be or and do black box testing or testing and just test the interface without bothering to mock the and you can argue that this is not a unit test but instead a system test or a function test it might give the best value for your money or your money or more time with your significant other at least more time to watch discovery you have old allow black box allow dependencies between the tests and compile a sequence of test that sets up the test data and manipulates and its at least tested automatically while not tested

 you successfully serialized your linq 2 sql objects for i tried this see below as to it really fell there were relationships in my l2s entity pointing to and then the child pointing back to the parent and obviously when enumerating for building the wcf it could not traverse the tree infinitely in this fashion and the best i it resulted in an overflow so what i am basically saying is beware if you go down this up on i would suggest transforming your wcf objects to model kind glad the above did not as i would always prefer to make a custom wcf object which transports a clean subset of exactly what the wcf request needs and it then include a stack of superfluous data to be sent across the and sure your l2s entities have lots of the actual reason i tried sending my l2s data directly across the wire was because i had to make an engine which employed certain these rules were stored in a correlation of about 4 database tables with relationships and it was not viable to upkeep a separate wcf in the end what i ended up doing was extending custom code gen classes to include with and then cloned property for property the l2s classes wcf custom worked perfectly in the end and this is the procedure i used with instructions on my am happy with this and feel there is bad practice hope this

 you use recursion to reduce the complexity of your problem at you apply recursion until you reach a simple base case that can be solved with this you can solve the last recursive and with this all other recursive steps up to your original	
 you use sql a feature that allows you to generate a script to create the entire executing the script once a valid connection string is given is rather easy to do through the usual sql classes for such a simple data sql server might be you should investigate other smaller like	
 you use sql server to store session it be possible to dig into the but it be you really want to do you might want to create a custom class for session and store that in the application for you might want to associate an with a hybriddictionary that stores you could then spy on the data at an application	
 you use static arrays you have access to the size of array using sizeof if put it into you can pass it to function by reference and passing argument by reference and by pointer is the same on assembly level almost sure of if you use dynamic you know the size of array at compile so you can store this value in but you will also store only a pointer to array in foo int int you can pass this structure by but what you realy do is passing pointer to int to and int of my opinion it help you the only thing that is in is that you store the size and the array in one place and it is easy to get the size of the if you will use a lot of dynamic arrays you can do it this but if you will use few easier will be not to use	
 you use the builtin	
 you use the collection for the appropriate excel workbook you could then just iterate through the collection and edit the property if you find if it is not present you could then create the	
 you use the get parameters like you suggsted then you have to touch at your decorator can inspect and find what it avoid hardcoding template maybe you could wrap the return value from the view instead of returning the output of you could return a tuple of and let the decorator mangle the template how about something like i tested this def context if in becomes return return is a really basic but i hope it gets the idea you could modify several other things about the such as adding information to the template you could use those context variables to integrate with your site like google for a you could refactor this decorator in the future if you decide to stop using get parameters and move to something based on if you already have a lot of views and you want to modify them you could write your own version of return from import as def mimetype if in becomes return return return

 you use you can preserve the ordering in which the entries were added to the a matching entry i gather that you want to append some of its data to the original queue in this you can either update the hashed object in or use to replace the queued item with a new that this preserves the order of the original but i have not tested that your code will need to explicitly synchronize read and write access to the and the data inside you want to be updating an item in the queue at the same time that another thread is grabbing it for the easiest way to synchronize is probably by accessing the through

 you want curved you can use which are mathematically defined curves specified by two vector you plop down the and then solve for a nice curve between a search should reveal source code or math that you can derive into source the nice thing about this is that you can solve for the heading of your vehicle as well as get the next location on your path by doing a percentage the difficult thing is that you have to do a curve length calculation if you want the same number of steps between each set of alternate approach is to use a hidden bitmap with the path drawn on it as a single pixel wide you can find the next location in the path by matching the pixels surrounding your current location to a and then updating the vector with a delta function at each we used this approach for a path traveling prototype where a was being along various paths using a and it works okay until you have some intersections that confuse your vector but if a unidirectional closed this would work just and dead simple to you can smooth out the heading angle of your vehicle by averaging the last few each pixel becomes one so your velocity control is the former you can have specially tagged endpoints for locations or points of in the just use a different color pixel on the path for special in either what you display will probably not be the underlying path but some prettied up representation of your pick whatever is and write a function that steps to the next path location and updates your vehicle heading whenever the car is in if really you can do some radius based collision handling so that cars will automatically stop when a car in front of them on the track has

 you want to avoid the complaint that it runs on every at least use the rule of like people are concerned about so the software is this would seem to be the crux of your common for the test suite to be separate from the packaged not being allowing users to run tests themselves on their systems and give you the results is a great aspect of a collaborative relationship with running up against the proprietary business you can compromise by trimming down or rewriting the tests and the diagnostics to only prove an adequate amount of fitness without revealing too i back down from throwing out the tests and diagnostics of what written so really should make the argument that users will be pleased and have more confidence in a software package shipped with a thorough testing and that these outweigh any fears of revealing the

 you want to manage different branches of the same code because as common as the code may you will want to make sweeping and one project will the not be as important as the and then you will get one branch growing faster than the insert this is more or less the industry big config limit things based on it can make the app a bit but as long as the code complains about mutually exclusive stuff and all the developers are in constant communication about new features and how they ripple throughout the entire you should do this also is the easiest to if that is a this also if you are using plugins are relatively you only have to worry about dependency if the plugins have any chance of becoming circularly interdependant a requires b requires c requires then this will quickly explode and you will revert back to best resources you have are probably the past experiences of your coworkers on different and the experience of people yammering about it on here or slashdot or certainly the of sharing change changes data is only one easier for everyone to be on the same of sharing change changes be one bug is in it affects of quicker to implement a specific feature for a specific to hack when you realize that assumption a is only applicable for markets b and not of or more of the copied projects will eventually due to a lack of cohesion in your above sweeping changes take a lot

 you want to provide multiple values to a one clean way to do this is to have separate one for each instead of trying to pass them all in one another clean way to do this is to create a new class that combines all these values into one and expose a single property of that for class private as private as private as public property destination as return end end end public property due as return end end end public property expected as return end end end i think necessary to implement property procedures instead of directly exposing the internal field values in order for the properties to show up in a property if you have this then you can create a property of type traindetails on your control that will encapsulate all these properties in one i think they will be editable in the property grid as a single property with an expandable next to it to edit the individual

 you were pretty try t foobar2 public return foobar1 foobar2 fb2 issue you were having is that you were specifying the return type of as you should have it as just you want to do specific things for you can specialize the on return sounds like you are having issues with the compiler not finding the definition for your templated templates in are rather and the usual practice is to put the entire template implementation in a header you might try imagematrix public various functions t create a new instance of imagematrix and return find the gcc but on explicit template instantiation and it gives a bit of an idea of likely want to either include the implementation in the header as i suggested or call getrotatedcopy in the or else instantiate it explicitly in the see below for the reason this works differently from is that templates in unlike actually create a whole new for each different combination of template is a completely different class a different set of compiled than see for a better to the error going away when you use the that actually tell you since until you actually instantiate a not going to update going to you can only use it if the pointer is actually pointing to an instance of the class you are casting works similar to the operator in suspect that what you are wanting is the you start out with an instance of and want to use a base class method on and get back a new copy of try something along these t return imagefilter public imagefilter imagefilter otherfilter if you really do want to start out with an imagematrix and transform it into an have to add a constructor on imagefilter that takes an

 you wish to use you could use will give you a number between 0 and 100 that represents the percentage of physical memory in use and totalphys will tell you total total amount of physical memory in is tricky because usable memory is a blend of physical and virtual the specific and what goes is determined by the operating this is somewhat configurable as windows allows you to stipulate how much virtual memory to if note that not all of the memory in windows is available for windows may report up to 4gb installed but only is available for actual use by the operating system and this has to do with legacy addressing issues

 your not actually being allowed to access bad memory directly since interfacing through the nsarray happening is that giving the object a bad and it is informing you by throwing an exceptions that happen on the main thread of an nsapplication application do not cause the application to they log the error and abort the current run loop cycle and then start the next more information on how you can deal with these exceptions during your debugging please take a look at it describes various techniques and responses you can use when dealing with application level reading and writing bad memory always cause the application to why those kinds of errors can be so hard to track you could simply be corrupting other objects and have no idea that done so until much latter in the the important thing to remember here is that nsapplication will squash most exceptions happening on the main so you have to pay extra attention to
