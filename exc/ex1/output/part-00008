 1 x y your and are very so is going to be smaller way too small to influence the results of your so as far as 1 x means you can store the numbers with 1 and instead of just add them as long as the results are always much less than be close enough to the mathematically precise results that you care about the just you say of them are very close to obviously this technique work for numbers that are not close to 1 that if and are but if one is large and one is it might still you only care about the magnitude of the product if both numbers are not close to you can just use regular java

 40 years part is easy but to get a truly accurate decimal not sure how you translate the rest of the age into a decimal you see age is expressed in and the calculation that you have to deal with anniversary like if someone was born on january when are they 1 month the answer is march but in some years that is 28 days later and some years 29 days is a javascript implementation i did that tries to deal with i suppose the decimal could express the number of days since the most recent birthday anniversay divided by the number of days till the next birthday and if you wanted to get more precise you could do it in seconds using the same i think it is a poor representation of an we just usually represent an age like make sure your datetimes are in the same timezone for your

 a asp i ventured into webforms world about 5 years after having to handcode things like table in scripting it seemed like webforms would be a tremendous it is until you need even a slight bit of customization beyond alternating row colors and the you could have a gridview running with a few but customizing even what would seem like a simple thing could turn into hours of torture and also think a lot of the examples given in online are oversimplified for the effect of making webforms look sure you can get that gridview to show only 10 records of a record but do you realize that all of the records are being loaded into memory by as an example of the of rectifying that i spent a while creating a pageable gridview that only loads chunks of but it after an hour of i found that you had to delete an extra property that the ide inserts into the not fun when stupid stuff like that sets you at every it even get me started on then the clouds and mvc was handed to now that is a if you are a web you should know whats happening when someone makes a request to your the abstraction and layer of cruft that webforms put on top of that is a the most able to develop applications at the speed of php scripting and finally have total control over the what all as an additional people need to stop complaining that they are creating in mvc views when they find they have to use tags and the drag and drop your gridview onto the set all the then view the crap it gives and your not nearly done now you have to attach events and put more code in your talk about messing up the coding take a simple foreach loop

 a common mistake to think of as a functional really it is best thought of as a family of but these days when people say lisp they usually mean common lisp allows functional but it a functional language per rather it is a general purpose scheme is a much smaller that is more functional in and of course there are for your question is it a good that really depends on your common lisp particularly has some real strengths for this sort of both interactive and introspective at a level you usually see in scripting making it very quick to develop at the same time its compiled and has efficient so you can expect performance in the same ballpark as other efficient compilers a factor of two of c is typical while a large it has a much more consistent design than things like and the metaprogramming capabilities can make very easy to understand code for your particular if you only look at these lisp looks there are the community is you find many people to help if what looking while the built in library is you find as many 3rd party so you may end up writing more of it from while by no means a walled cl have the kind of smooth integration with foreign libraries that say python which mean you call c there are nice tools for they clos is about the most powerful oo system i can think but it is quite a different approach if coming from a mainstream oo background they but beyond single multiple not that you may find it a bit strange at almost turned inside you go this you are going to have to watch for some issues with performance of the actual rendering if you write that yourself with the class system has incredible runtime flexibility updating class definitions at runtime not via monkey patching but via actually changing the class and updating however you pay some dispatch cost on what used cl in the past for research code requiring numerical simulations of a different it works well for in that case i worried about using existing code it so i was writing pretty much everything from scratch it could be a fine choice of language for this but not the only if you use a language with both aspects and good performance cl as does and a few i would definitely look at the possibility of a two level approach with a language like lua or perhaps python of on top of some c or code doing the heavy

 a good idea to have some sort of central because allow for you to share but also have a branch somewhere that you can directly generate your your snapshots that server will probably have more than one one of which is thought of as a any previous releases will have their own and depending on the hierarchy of your team if you are divided into groups with each group working on one aspect of the then there may be team or feature based though if you work that way not because it is distributed each developer will also have their own local to make things nice and or they can each have multiple for instance a developer who likes to work while commuting may have a repository on his and another one on his with branches on his laptop that are from the ones on his up to i guess that the part makes this kind of thing a lot because you can commit and even branch while you are away from the transitioning from a then you can just slip straight into the same model as because a dvcs is flexible enough to work in the same you can just start with a single central repository with a few and it is always trivially easy to create more repositories and branches last thing is that you still need the fact that various developers each have copies of the same thing adds but it is not dvcs i use regularly is i have also tried

 a little we have an intranet site based on wss that is hosted on a server in and set up to use integrated windows authentication to authenticate users against active directory user accounts of setup works just fine for users who are logged into windows using an ad account from but when users try to access the site from a pc logged into windows using an ad account from a different domain the following problems user must manually enter their credentials as rather than just because internet explorer automatically inserts and causes authentication to logged if the user does something that requires the browser to pass their authentication through to a client such as clicking on a microsoft office document in a document library in order to open it for it appears that invalid credentials are passed thus forcing the user to manually enter their credentials then is there any way to implement a type of behavior when using integrated windows authentication can be done when using basic clear text so that if a user on does not enter a domain before their user is inserted automatically for i realize this deployment may be fatally so i am also open to suggestions for a different the main problem stems from two different kinds of users needing to access the same content on one sharepoint the users in all have their own workstations where they log into windows as the users in unfortunately have to use shared computers that are logged on using generic type accounts that have no permissions in sharepoint thus the requirement that the users must provide their credentials on demand when accessing a given page in i would like to preserve the convenience of the integrated windows authentication for the users of while minimizing the amount of manual authentication that the users in have to authentication across multiple

 a pretty abstract given that both composition aggregation are pretty similar really only different conceptually and not necessarily at the code you might consider a car having an engine to be and a dog having fleas to be but nothing stopping you implementing them in the same way if you were modelling them in if you want to break down the differences try forcibly add software design decisions to highlight those differences i guess you could do something like taking example from differs from ordinary composition in that it does not imply in when the owning object is so are the contained in this is not necessarily for a university owns various departments and each department has a number of if the university the departments will no longer but the professors in those departments will continue to a university can be seen as a composition of whereas departments have an aggregation of in a professor could work in more than one but a department could not be part of more than one might build this code to represent it as many contrived indications of class university private departments new public void the university is in charge of the lifecycle of it creates them public void the the departments foreach department in class department makes no sense if it connected to exactly private university private string of professors can be added meaning that one professor a member of many departments public professors internal constructor since a department makes no sense on its should try to limit how it can be created internal string public void the but let the professors worry class

 a python programmer who has had a taste of ruby likes i think there is somewhat of an ironic parallel to when python was beginning to become and java programmers would stating that it a real and that the dynamic nature of its types would be and allow people to create as python became more and the advantages of its rapid development time became not to mention the less verbose p new began to see some more dynamic features appear in later versions of autoboxing and make it less troublesome to deal with and generics allow us to code once and apply it to many was with some amusement that i saw one of the key flexible features of ruby monkey being touted as dangerous by the python having started teaching ruby to students this i think that being able to the implementation of an existing even one that is part of the is very you can screw up badly and your program can i can segfault in c pretty and java apps can die flaming truth i see monkey patching as the next step in dynamic and since it has been around since

 a very good osgi citizen as many of the assumptions hibernate makes on class visibility are no longer true in an osgi usual way of loading jdbc drivers with the class work inside osgi in this hibernate will try and load the driver but find it as hibernate import the jdbc driver jdbc driver manager also tries to be smart by working out whether the calling class loader should see the driver and this also conflicts with you use spring to configure hibernate then i suggest you use the class as this works in osgi and spring allows you to configure hibernate with a concrete data source rather than passing a class name that hibernate needs to you get past that problem probably run into the issues of hibernate not seeing your domain i only have experience with the xml mapping with i think is simpler in osgi as i think the annotations way requires aop weaving of some sort and another current with the unless you use something like dm server need to become much more familiar with class loading mechanism and how you can use approach to services to work around the incompatibilities between vanilla java and the osgi look into how enterprise libraries use the context class loader and how you can manage i am using spring dm to wrap legacy code in osgi services as this makes it easy to control the context class

 a way to automatically block browser requests hitting your server side but there are ways to identify which scripts have been triggered by your application and which is usually done using something called the basic idea is that the page making the ajax request should generate a unique token is typically a hash of unix timestamp salt this token and timestamp should be passed as parameters to the ajax the ajax handler script will first check this token the validity of the unix timestamp if it falls within 5 minutes of the token if the token checks you can then proceed to fulfill this this token generation checking can be coded up as an apache module so that it is triggered automatically and is separate from the application scripts be able to generate valid tokens they figure out your and so you can safely ignore in mind that storing a token in the session is also another but that buy any more security than your authentication

 ability to share session state between asp classic and an intrinsic feature of either though fairly easy to provides sample using you could pretty easily implement something similar in basically use the asp classic portion of code then in php write a fairly simple class to read session state from the database into an array or collection when each page is a little extra work in but be more than a few extra days of coding and runs pretty well on iis6 in my limited experience and support for it is supposedly even better in the only snag hit in is that a most of the php code out there assumes running on but generally this is only an issue for code user image that works with local filesystem because they assume your filesystem uses instead of like on obviously fairly trivial to

 allow you to move windows between machines would require a silly amount of work behind the but it does allow you to share a keyboard and mouse between two machines so they to be all one but actually run personally use as i found it more stable than i have my laptop with an external monitor to the and my desktop to the left as an input director my desktop runs a different and is basically my guinea pig box for testing stuff and for anything i need to keep running when i leave the cut paste is pretty so i can quite happily fire up an rdp session to a server on my and sql scripts from that to my a very useful thing to have if you have a few physical boxes and monitors kicking around

 also an embedded software developer thinking of moving to web not because losing my job are enough opportunities for embedded guys in where i but because after 9 years in the like to try something that not just switching jobs switching nobody will hire you as a web developer if you are inexperienced in this field in the current economic may try to find a job at a larger internet company service where your embedded skills get i saw a job posting recently for a voip developer position at an they were looking for someone familiar with c and because using some library written in these that sounds like a good entry point for an embedded developer seeking to switch in this new probably have plenty of opportunities to learn about web internal trainings on new web learning from experienced internal job

 also needs to be careful that changing from operators introduce an undesirable side for if iterating over a loop 5 times simply to run a set of code multiple times without any interest in the loop index probably okay on the other hand if you do access the loop index value than the result may not be what you for int i i i for int i i i for int i i for int i i in the first two cases show no but notice that attempting to the fourth case by switching to a operator would result in an iteration being completely admittedly this is a bit of a contrived case but i have seen this sort of loop iteration when going through an array in reverse from end to

 always been interested in writing web software like forums or things which take a limited markup to rewrite into but noticed more and more that for try googling bbcode parser and test a few you either get an inefficient or you get poor code with xss holes here and my previously mentioned of the poor bbcode parsers out how would you avoid now take your typical regular expression for handling a and you can mention how vulnerable it is and how to avoid assume input has already been encoded by htmlspecialchars with image tags are hardly more secure than i have several specific mostly specific to php it better in this to only match using a validation is it better to use and a then ascertain whether or not the input is a valid as would be obvious the would work in the above url but would fail if the was about functions like within a would they be any deterrence or problem far as uri standards it be safer to write a is the time and processing power needed to develop and use such a thing too weighty for something handling several different entries per know my example is one of and is more specific than shirk from providing your looking for principles and best and general recommendations for in a and the on

 am not sure why this question was down i think a great one thing to google and read some random websites which a lot of times are trying to sell you something rather than to be and another thing to ask so crowd which are mangers to share their and what works or work for their that this point is out of the i am sure a lot of developers will point you towards keep in mind that these terms are often used very loosely especially i am probably going to sound very controversial by saying this which is not my but these methodologies are especially scrum which is more of a product being marketed by scrum consultants than having said at the end of a you got to use what works the best for you and your if or go for at the same time you need to be flexible about become religious about any or if something is not working for or you can get more efficient by changing go for be more specific regarding your the basic summary of techniques that have been working for me lot of these are common all the and emails pertaining to a specific and make it accessible to others through a central location use ms onenote 2007 and love it for all my and bug meetings you should try to should be followed by action items where each item is assigned to a specific any verbal agreement should be put into a written all documents added to the project onenote in my starting any new have a written document of what the system will be capable of doing what it wont commit to but be flexible to business how detailed the document should detailed enough so that everyone understands what the final system will be capable are but be realistic and to yourself and business the basic guideline that i release and software that lacks some rather than a buggy software with all the open lines of communication among your team and between your developers and business but at the end of a one person a few key should be responsible for making key test where it makes but do not become obsessive about code coverage no and software works correctly according to the have code and code commit to but if it does not work for some situations allow for your code especially hard to but make it into a back and clean up you code if you already working on that implementing new working on a bug fix but refactor it just for the sake of unless you have nothing else to do and the last and more important not become religious about any specific methodology or borrow the best aspects from and find the balance that works for you and your

 am using the same basic setup for a live application and it is working pretty i have the mobile device sync with the server using web services would also be and i have the desktop app syncing somewhat and everything works really it would be a bad idea to have a client sync with a server who then syncs with a server because then you have to manage more state and the common tools and guides will not help you would also recommend against using sql merge replication unless you consider yourself an expert at managing because if you are not one now you will be one by the time you safe using a if you are willing to spend the time and effort in making your own sync framework then you will find there is little you cannot

 an answer because too much to say for a comment question author studio express is not offering all this tools as which i asked express provide that you reply was unit documenting if i am think that you get what you want with visual studio see my conclusions studio deployment projects are certainly missing from visual studio but frankly not much of an the whole feature is half good enough to tick off a feature good enough for toy deployments but my opinion not really up to the rigors of the real installer is an open source toolkit from microsoft not a for creating the installer for microsoft office 2007 was built with so reasonable to believe that it can handle any smaller installation tool is the scriptable install perhaps easier to understand than but also not using with the msi technology built into windows and therefore harder to manage in the enterprise microsoft testing framework is and while up to the not the leader of the in if you google around for reactions to find many who think it a ripoff of was a time that you could integrate any of the test tools into visual studio using though that no longer work is to use the external runner programs for your unit testing tool all of the major unit testing frameworks come with when using vs express i tend to have the test runner hanging around in the rerunning tests then just involves a task is the grandaddy of the testing and it works very there are others around such as and version of visual studio has a good story for in they all have the a compiler switch to generate xml files based on the documentation convert those xml files into real you need other used to be the but that project is unfortunately now dead a sad microsoft open source is likely to become the new gold but the tool yet as mature and easy to use as we would is a new release in this might be worth you can there are good ways to achieve the goals you even using visual studio in there are only two things gain from moving up to a paid version of visual get if you want be able install like and someone getting i think the value proposition is start with the free tools and spend money when you have enough experience to spend it

 an app to hit a web server 10 times a second is not a good web servers are designed for less frequent client requests and probably larger processing times and reponse sizes than your game will be not to say a web server be able to cope just that it would not be an efficient any type of app that requires multiple packets per second you really should think about a lighter protocol than http which is fairly for example if your game needs to send 4 bytes to register a battleship you really want to transmit an extra few hundred bytes of http recommend a browser plugin technology like siverlight of both of those support tcp socket you would need to write your own server to sit at the other end of the tcp with that approach also have the advantage of being able to push data out to the clients without having to rely on client polling mechanisms which are required with

 an experienced c programmer dipping my toes in oo design i have a particular piece of code i hate and would like to clean up using code implements a display tree for use in a 3d graphics it is a linked list of entries which have a type field specifying whether the entry is a geometry feature or light in particular geometry features can either be a single piece of geometry of a collection of sub which is indicated by the presence of a separate a linked list it is a flat structure but the order implies each entry has an attribute structure which is able to be propagated down the separate function allows this list to be traversed and a provided function pointer to be executed on traversal of the each function used in this way must take proper care to maintain the attribute structure as it is propagated down the list and this is a frequent cause of rendering bugs things not realising they should be redrawn because they are part of a group of for some aspects of oo design jump right out at me i am interested to i would best implement being able to pass a function pointer down a list vector are stl vectors ok for lists like i would be right to implement windows and geometry features as related even the classes to best design a class that can have a collection of suggestions regarding attribute transferral between objects the desired behaviour is that modifying a feature will alter the attributes of that feature and any it and modifying a will only modify that realize this is a long and broad so appreciate your thoughts on any of the above design propagating

 and i are having an argument over the value and usage of tags in looking to the stackoverflow community to put in their thoughts to help us resolve the side claims that tags are a valuable addition to release an example of their we do a maven which makes a new tag it which is code snapshot used for this this tag should be a readonly when a bug needs to be fixed we can make a copy of the tag into a new branch it bug fixes go these fixes may be merged back into trunk so that the main dev branch gets the bug is released and a tag is automatically this cycle the main benefit here of the tag is that if you ever need to version for any you can just release the tag with the confidence that never been altered by saying tag is cleaner than saying revision 1 of branch which is the original without the other side claims that tags providing any valuable especially in a system like subversion with global which act like a tag in subversion only gives a warning when committing to a it actually stop their method is developing in trunk and upon release make a branch called continue bug fixes in trunk and if you needed to those bug fixes to merge them into branch and at some perhaps after major fixes or features in release and make branch cycle if you ever need to release the original have to check out branch revision both methods like to hear the thoughts on which method is preferred and a little worried that the way depends on the underlying scm either settle on subversion for answers or if possible keep it scm usage of tags in

 and serialization are synonymous in the context of remote procedure but semantically different as a matter of marshaling is about getting parameters from here to while serialization is about copying structured data to or from a primitive form such as a byte in this serialization is one means to perform usually implementing is also possible for an object to be marshaled by in which case the data the is simply location information for the original such an object may still be amenable to value there may be additional metadata such as code base location or even object implementation

 and should fix the others will tell you to do things like edit the generated but not a good practice the changes will go away as soon as the web reference is seeing is by see how web services when you use web visual studio downloads the wsdl file from the and uses the xml schemas from the wsdl to create some proxy classes to represent the xml described by the it also creates a proxy class for the service having methods for each operation in the proxy data classes can serialize to the xml that the service is expecting to and can be deserialized back from the xml that the server sends in way to think of it is that you only have this problem because both client and service are if your client were written in then you be thinking of sharing that wcf can do if it introduces a dependency between the client and service both have to use compatible versions of the assembly containing the but when you need to do the option is useful when there is behavior in these classes that must be used both by the client and by the

 answer given by covers pretty well most part of the i will now deal with the very last paragraph as simply as i should be implemented for for your derived class to be reused in old not for your class reusing parts of the base class can use aggregation for that if you have a class that is to be used on new code with some new but should be used transparently as a former then inheritance is your new code can use the new functionality and old code will seamlessly use your new this is the general there are some common the line here is subtle and your question is about precisely that if you have a collection of objects of type that should be because those objects are meant to be used only with they are behave like techniques as or downcasts in to detect the real runtime type is something that i would flag in a code review and only accept after having the programmer explain to great detail why any other option is worse than that i would accept for in answer under the premises that the information is not available with the given operations in that the base type does not have any method that would offer enough information for the caller to determine the and if it does not make sense to include such besides the prepresentation are you going to perform any operation on the objects based on that same if logic depends on the real then the operation should be in base class to be overriden in derived if that is not possible operation is new and only for some given there should at least be an operation in the base to allow the caller to determine that a downcast will not and then i would really require a sound reason for the caller code to require knowledge of the real why does the user want to see it in different will the user perform different operations on each one of the you endup requiring to use code to bypass the type your design has a strange to of never say but you can surely avoid depending on or downcasts for	
 answer here is that a web reference will create a client proxy class that allows your code to talk to a web service that is described via wsdl and communicates via soap or http get posters indicate that it is only but web references can also talk to web services or or ruby so long as they all talk wsdl and conform to the interoperability service reference will create a client proxy class that communicates with a service regardless of whether that wcf service is a web service or

 answer is thinking the error is simply telling you that you did not as a lexical so perl interprets it as that you must be referring to a package perl does not complain when you use an undefined it considers it a package you appear to have on somewhere standard and recommended which wants you to declare your variables before using if you declare the variable in the current package it assumes referring to a variable declared in another so it asks you to append the package just to keep everything clear and uses to declare scoped and to declare package in case you got the wrong the error message would go away if you turned strict your problem and they might go no my just that is and this error could cause subtler errors in other plus think if you had assigned only to no my gives you a message about and you can tell that it was a and forgo at least 30 minutes not seeing it and wondering if your query is or

 answer once accepted here is incorrect has since been so it does not correctly eliminate all trivially it may appear to work but it can especially in the case that 0 and 1 are considered valid for the following at and are perpendicular lines which clearly do not dot dot to the above these two line segments meet at an endpoint of 0 and that endpoint would apparently the two line segments meet at which is on line but not on line so what is going the answer is that the values of 0 and 1 are not valid and only sometimes happen to correctly predict endpoint when the extension of one line not the would meet the line the algorithm predicts an intersection of line but this is not i imagine that by testing starting with ab vs cd and then also testing with cd vs this problem would be only if both fall between 0 and 1 inclusively can they be said to recommend using the vector cross product method if you must predict

 answer this in terms of but other programming environments can be add that this solution is valid to solve the problem in any number of dimensions that we have two line segments in pq and here are a few random sets of p q r s infinite line is easily defined p we r that for each when the parameter is at 0 or we get one of the original endpoints on the line we know that and way of defining a line parametrically is very useful in many imagine we were looking down along line can we find the point of smallest distance from the line segment rs to the infinite line this is most easily done by a projection into the null space of line n is a pair of basis vectors that span the two dimensional subspace orthogonal to the line r s what we have done is to project the vector rs into the 2 dimensional subspace orthogonal to the line by subtracting off p point on line to get r and we ensure that the infinite line passes through the origin in this projection we have reduced this to finding the minimum distance from the line to the origin in the projection recall that the line is defined by the parameter v r normal vector to the line will give us what we since we have reduced this to 2 dimensions because the original space was we can do it just have used null this little trick works in n n is now a vector with unit the distance from the infinite line to the origin is d that i could also have used to get the same the actual distance is but as it turns d was positive here d we determine v from recall that the origin is a distance of d units from the line that connects points r and therefore we can write r for some value of the scalar form the dot product of each side of this equation with the vector and solve for v tells us that the closest approach of the line segment rs to the origin happened outside the end points of the line so really the closest point on rs to the origin was the point out from the this tells us that the closest point on line segment rs to the infinite line pq was the point is one more step in the analysis to what is the closest point on the line segment does this point fall inside the line or does it too fall outside the project the point s onto the line expression for u is easily enough derived from similar logic as i did note here that used to do the u that u lies in the interval we have solved the the point on line pq p the distance between closest points on the two line segments all of this can be compressed into just a few short lines of but it helps to expand it all out to gain understanding of how it

 anyone have any suggestions for a best practice or preferred way of rolling back database transactions made from an integration test framework such as is our current we have a web project with a number of unit tests which work fine in our unit test environment each test inherits a parent class which opens a transaction in the and rolls back the transaction in the after each our unit test database is restored back to the original things change once we get to our integration our continuous integration server automatically compiles our commits and pushes them out to a test so that the server always runs on the most up to date also setup a selenium instance to automate user interaction with the the selenium tests basically communicate with an existing selenium and tell the server things a browser and go to enter text into form field with id assert new page contains text test is run in a similar manner to our vanilla unit but with an important any changes made by selenium are done in a completely different and therefore we we at roll them back in the test yet to come to a good solution for right now at a point where using a sqlcommand to execute a sql statement to backup the then at the end of the setting the database to single dropping the current and restoring the old copy this is less than because that effectively kills the application that was attached to the and requires us to yet again the this a problem that has been solved any advice would be database after integration

 apologize for the half but to see if this actually possible will take quite a bit of you look at the xml fairly particularly the hash which if you then the ide will delete the tried that actually automate it you would need to use the vs automation the apis are pretty and also i find a specific class or anything dealing with class diagrams in look through the important enough for you to spend a couple hours you would start by creating one manually so that you can inspect it with the automation the envdte com cocreated or supplied in a vs use to open your then use to find your project with the class and to find the class diagram i would first look to see if the kind property on the projectitem indicated something and then fiddle with other properties and reflect over the object property of the projectitem to see if you get something you just need to generate it then take a look at the property to get a list of available the command invoked by right clicking on the menu should be in there then you could use as uiheirarchy to get the solution explorer window and fiddle with uiheirarchy and uiheirarchyitem to select the files and then invoke the i provide a full but since i have the tree walking code it would take a couple

 appear to be using a rather narrow definition would i be right in presuming that you define encapsulation to data with wrong then please ignore the rest of this is not a loose in defined by the international organisation for the reference model of open distributed processing defines the following five any concrete or abstract thing of a model of an an object is characterised by its behaviour by its an a collection of actions with a set of constraints on when they may an abstraction of the behaviour of an object that consists of a subset of the interactions of that object together with a set of constraints on when they may the property that the information contained in an object is accessible only through interactions at the interfaces supported by the can further make a as some information is accessible via these some information must be hidden and inaccessible within the the property such information exhibits is called information which parnas defined by arguing that modules should be designed to hide both difficult decisions and decisions that are likely to see one of the great computing important to note that it is not only the data that is it is some subset of behaviour associated with the object that is difficult or likely to your you seem to be saying that the difference between encapsulation in oo and in functional programming stems from data but at least according to the iso and data management is not the key to so i see why encapsulation in functional programming need be any different from that in in your post that functional programming provides by the methods rather than the data i is a difference of scale rather than of if i use the rather please let me know if then you seem to find significance in encapsulation by object and functional encapsulation by by the iso definition an object is anything i wish to thus classes may be encapsulated within a so long as some of those classes contribute to the interface the public classes of the and some are private classes in the the same methods are encapsulated within a class some methods being public and some you can even take this a notch lower and say that mccabian sequential sequences of code are encapsulated within each forms a graph of nodes encapsulated within encapsulated and all these graphs form a graph thus functional programming may well encapsulated at the but this is no different from the graph of and essentially no difference from the graph of oo note that word parnas uses information hiding concerns potential such as the changing of difficult design decisions in the you ask where encapsulation is certainly a strength of but the question then does strength and the answer is one of resounding change encapsulation reduces the maximum potential burden of concept is useful itself is defined measure of the strength of association established by a connection from one module to in another of great as the paper in words never since connections between modules also minimizes the paths along which changes and errors propagate into other parts of the thus eliminating where changes in one part cause errors in necessitating additional changes giving rise to new defined there are two limitations which can easily be coupling does not measure and these connections can give rise to just as effects as connections paper does to relate but this is not defined in terms of connections between elements references to labels or with which coupling was the coupling of any computer program is a in that modules are connected there is little scope within the definition of coupling to manage the potential changes of which parnas these issues are to some with the concept of potential the maximum possible number of connections formable among all elements of a in for a class that is default within a package cannot have connections formed on it no outside classes can depend on reflection but a public class within a package can have dependencies on this public class would contribute to the potential coupling even if no other classes depend on it at the moment classes might depend on it in when the design see consider the principle of the principle of burden takes two strong form states that the burden of transforming a collection of entities is a function of the number of entities the weak form states that the maximum potential burden of transforming a collection of entities is a function of the maximum potential number of entities burden of creating or modifying any software system is a function of the number of classes created or modified we presuming an oo and are concerned with encapsulation at the we could equally have concerned ourselves with the level of functional that is modern software development is usually or or that depend on a modified class have a higher probability of being impacted than classes that do not depend on the modified maximum potential burden a modified class can impose is the impacting of all classes that depend on the dependencies on a modified class therefore reduces the probability that its update will impact other classes and so reduces the maximum potential burden that that class can is little more than a of the maximum potential number of dependencies between all classes in a system therefore reduces the probability that an impact to a particular class will cause updates to other and thus reduces the maximum potential burden of all by reducing the maximum potential number of dependencies between all therefore mitigates the weak form of the principle of this is all covered which attempts to mathematically prove such using potential coupling as the logical means of structuring a that when you encapsulation the key to all worthwhile the answer must surely there is no single key to all worthwhile encapsulation in certain merely a tool to help improve the quality of code so that it may also write encapsulation can be a barrier to flexible extension of an yes it most certainly it is indeed designed to be a barrier against extending the design decisions of an object that are difficult or likely to this is thought to be a bad an alternative approach would be to have all classes public and have a program express its maximum potential but then the weak form of the principle of burden states that updates will become increasingly these are the costs against which barriers to extension are to be you make the interesting comparison between encapsulation and and in your semantics are its greater no semanticist either even know such a word existed before the good mister ramsey alluded to it in his but i presume you in the sense or an interpretation of the of a and very basically that a class with method should be called a is great strength indeed in this is curious to me is that you pit semantics against encapsulation and look for a i doubt find my there are two forces that motivate the semantic and the encapsulation merely means encapsulation based on the meaning of the nodes use the general so if i tell you that i have two one and one called and then give you three classes cat and goat and ask into which packages these classes should be given no other you would be perfectly right to claim that the semantics of the system would suggest that the three classes be encapsulated within rather than other motivation for is and particularly the study of potential mentioned encapsulation theory actually provides equations for the number of packages that should be used to encapsulate a number of classes in order to minimise the potential encapsulation as a whole is the between this semantic and logical allow the potential coupling of my programs to rise above the minimum if this makes the program semantically easier to but enormous and wasteful levels of potential coupling will be a warning that my program needs to be no matter how semantically obvious it if the good mister ramsey is still could you or your semanticist friends give me a better word for phase using it would be good to use a more appropriate

 are a couple different answers to this and it is a bit but some reasons i can think of are classes are reference if using 16 bytes for total probably not worth it to create memory references to 8 for each you have really small they can often be pushed onto the il instead of references to the this can really speed up some as eliminating a memory dereference on the callee is a bit of extra associated with classes in and if your data structure is very none of this fluff would be used so just extra junk you most important difference between a struct and a is that structs are value type and classes are reference

 are about solving it matter whether talking about the tools in a wood shop or a what impressed me about rails still is that it was extracted from framework used to build web apps and has repeatedly been improved by people who extended or changed it after using it to build web it was no mere academic of the specific problems it started if you are looking to get a web application underway what better choices could you have than a framework that specifies an existing directory structure based on with lots of code and choices already for you as to components like javascript testing you may not agree with all the choices but you can assume them and have something that will work for or more of projects and swap out something later if you have a term migrations give you ways to move data forward as your code something that happens in any yet most frameworks do not account for that at separating all of the parts of your application into a directory hierarchy already setup with areas for again aids the long term maintenance of your human configuration files give you extra opportunities for human logical once learned can avoid mistakes like the classic mistyped file name or class name in a configuration file of different modes of rails has built in support for the idea of having a different set of settings for development test real apps have this but often the framework around them accommodate it and you end up having to swap configuration files in and out to achieve the same effect human error several things mentioned above embrace and encourage good programming practices standardized project but rails is often explicit in encouraging them and not just for evidence of that you need look no further than its built in support for test driven

 are experiencing an oracle deadlock deadlock detected while waiting for it has been suggested that the issue is with a process that is performing readonly operations using hibernate while another process is performing an update on the same readonly process in question is configured using hibernate and we have not explicitly defined a transaction for the while that may not be ideal i fail to see why hibernate would try to get an exclusive lock on a row when no operations were performed only a my question does when no explicit transaction management is try to get a lock on a row even if only a of an object is no is it possible that defining a transaction around the service that is loading and then specifically saying readonly on the transactionattributes would cause hibernate to ignore an already existing row lock and just load the data for readonly are some code loading the record we are using a class hibernatepurchaseorderdataservice extends hibernatedaosupport implements purchaseorderdataservice public purchaseorderdata return spring configuration for the service calling this method actual deadlock is occurring on one of the purchaseorderitem records being loaded by the call to the load the this cause a deadlock if the record being loaded was locked by another and if so would adding a transaction wrapper such as the one below solve the all methods require a transaction the database team has seen trace messages on the server that seem to indicate that our process is actually writing to the database there are logged commands that are performed on the exact columns we are reading from the it seems that hibernate is automatically writing these records back out to the database though we asking it that would probably explain why there is a this be because of a session flush or something looking more like the solution might be to use a transaction wrapper with readonly on deadlock when hibernate application loading data for readonly	
 are facing a initialization the easiest way out is implemeting a singleton so that you can control the initialization as you are using multithreaded the singleton will have to be the check pattern for and probably a mutex and a condition to avoid race check your threading library documentation for documentation on this the general pseudo code would would be in your two last while wait for image image res already wake up producer is return image image while wait for image to be wake up consumer if it is threading library probably has better constructs for mutex acquisition and but the idea is that you have a single point where the two threads wait for the other to complete their tasks so that there is no thread	
 are few principles in database design which im sure you pretty much know if you took that they all say basically that your data should not be duplicated across multiple tables and all your columns should be integral to the table they appear then there are common entities aplied in all software design like objects and managing them is easiest part because it comes then there is optimization for scalability and performance which be hard if first steps are done and this is usually done together with software team which is writing code for your	
 are for saving composite patterns in a relational have been using modified preorder tree this is very quick to build the whole but very slow to insert or delete new nodes left and right values need to be also querying the children of a node is not easy and very thing we noticed is that you really have to make sure the tree get you need transaction otherwise the left and right values can get and fixing a corrupt left right tree is not an easy does work very good the modified preorder tree but i was wondering if there are better composite patterns in	
 are four basic this is the least maintainable but easiest to i personally consider use of to be a element at the top of the this is slightly better than because it keeps the markup however it wastes bandwidth and makes it harder to make sweeping css because you look at the and know what rules this lets you have the clean html clean main css it means your client must download lots of little css which increases bandwidth and page loading it very easy to big the main advantage of one big file is that only one thing to this is much more efficient in terms of bandwidth and you have any programming going you might be able to just dynamically combine multiple sheets from to get the effect of would recommend one big whether you actually maintain it as one file or generate the file through a build process or dynamically on the you can specify your selectors using ids include just in for the that was accepted when i wrote i disagree with finding a of classes that gives you the result you this sounds to me like the classes are identifying a visual style instead of a logical your classes should be something like and not then if you need to change the text colour on the user info you can say h1 color start applying classes all over the place because a class currently has a certain appearance that you you should put concepts into your represented by html with and then style those not the other way

 are in the process of doing exactly three years ago i joined the development team on a project with no unit almost no code and a fairly build code base consists of a set of com components oracle data cartridge and some java all using a core some of the code is nearly a decade first step was adding some unit the behaviour is very so there was some initial effort in generating a unit test framework now extended to other modules with junit and which uses test data from a most of the initial tests were functional tests which excercised the outermost layers and not really unit you will probably have to expend some effort you may need to budget to implement a test find it helps a lot if you make the cost of adding unit tests as low as the test framework made it relatively easy to add tests when fixing bugs in existing new code can have proper unit as you refactor and implementn new areas of code you can add proper unit tests which test much smaller areas of the last year we have added continuous integration with cruisecontrol and automated our build this adds much more incentive to keep tests and which was a big problem in the early so i would recommend that you include regular least unit test runs as part of your development have recently focussed on improving our code review which was fairly infrequent and the intent is to make it much cheaper to initiate and perform a code review so that developers are encouraged to do them more also as part of our process improvement i am trying to get time for code reviews and unit tests included in project planning at a much lower level in a way that ensures individual developers have to think more about whereas previously there was just a fixed proportion of time devoted to them that was much easier to get lost in the

 are not the one is bitwise or and one is logical y is a logical means the same as or and applies to bool it is used in conditionals or x and y in that case can be replaced with any expression that evaluates to a x y clause evaluates to true if either of the two conditions is if the first condition is true the file then the second condition need not and will not be single pipe is a bitwise to know what this means you must be understand how numbers are stored in the suppose you have a quantity that holds the value it is actually stored as 0x000f which is the same as 0000 0000 0000 1111 in the bitwise or takes two quantities and each pair of corresponding bits so that if the bit is 1 in either it is 1 in the if a 0101 0101 0101 0101 evaluates to 0x5555 in and b 1010 1010 1010 1010 is then a b 1111 1111 1111 1111 can use bitwise in to test if one or more of a particular set of bits is turned you might do this if you 12 booleans or binary values to test and they are all suppose you have a student a set of independent booleans might be things rather than store a boolean field for each one of those you could store just a single bit for each the might be bit might be bit you can if a test to see if no bits are turned except the is which is the bitwise or returns a 1 for each bit that is on in either if the result of the bitwise or above that means there are no bits turned on in the except the first bit but you tell for sure whether the first bit is because it it is is a corresponding and which is logical and and bitwise they have the analogous can if see if the first bit is turned on in a i believe i got voted down for	
 are not the same a function in c or is the organization of some procedural code into a single it has very specific semantics and you can read about them in any basic c book with much more advanced information in more advanced the other a macro is created during the phase of compilation and is not a separate part of the actual with a the macro is actually replaced in code before complication happens so that copies are injected wherever the macro is why side effects are important to consider when using macros if the macro uses the same argument more than the side effects will occur more than is a quick example to illustrate a the the macro is expanded to this can see how side effects are an issue in this doublerandom this when the macro is is actually called twice when you would have expected it to be called only

 are some general steps that will get you on your you must change your settings so that it creates pdb even for release later versions of the compiler do this by but in many versions of visual you must do this create program database and then keep an archive of those files along with each build of your it is critical that every build of your applications has its own set of you just reuse the same ones you made with build 10 to examing the dumps generated by build for over the life of your you will end up with a ton of so be prepared for you need to be able to identify the exact version of your application which generated the dump if you are creating your own minidumps calling for probably the easiest way to do this is to simply make part of the filename of the minidump the complete version number of your need to have a reasonable version numbering scheme in place for this to in my we increment the build number across all branches by one every time the autobuilder creates a that you have recieved the dump file from the you know the precise version of the application that created the and you have found the pdb files for this you need to go through your source history and find the source code for this exact version of the the best way to do this is to apply to your branches every time you make a set the value of the label to the exact version and it becomes easy to find in the almost ready to fire up the complete source tree for that version of your put it in a seperate place on your hard say for application version build the binaries for that exact version of your application and put them somewhere on your hard it might be easiest simply to install that version of your application to get the the pdb files in the same location as the binaries in step you have two options for viewing the dump you can use or using visual studio is but windbg is much more most of the time the functionality in visual studio will use visual all you have to do is open the dump file like it is a once the dump file by and if all the paths are set correctly it will take you right to the code that give you a call use you have to jump through a couple of the dump by windbg to go get the correct microsoft symbol type this may take a few moments as it will pull a ton of stuff down from the windbg where the symbols type substituting wherever you put the pdb files for the make sure you get the plus sign in there with no whitespace between and the sign or else screw up step windbg where the source code type substituting the path where you got code from source control for this version of the windbg to analyze the dump type a few if everything is configured windbg will take you right to the location of your at this point you have a million options for digging deep into your memory the state of critical but that is beyond the scope of this

 are two dogmas to steer clear release until you are as soon as you have no matter how like the latter but it needs to be taken with a grain of common an overhead to any depending on your organization and certainly have to do preferably of the complete delivery opposed to unit testing do you integrate with other target a range of have complex large amounts of business you release a commercial product you certainly will have to have sort of documentation in place and but even software requires user documentation if of the for commercial software change management processes if you are lucky enough to have them for deployment require time and your end users will have to pay attention and possibly your people can get pretty tired of new features all the even if they acknowledge their for complex want to schedule end user training which are kinda expensive if done once every two get me releasing early and often has great particularly since we never get the business requirements quite but you need to weight those benefits against the real costs of a this is one of the reasons i like internal releases interspersed among the they have lower but keep you development process honestly the i guess i end up with the classic

 are two primary ways to make a control automatically resize based on size changes of the parent container form in your the dock property of the control to the anchor property to the dock property with advantage of this method is that it takes the entire control and tells it to always fill the entire client area of the parent container your the form client useful if you want to do something like fill a form with a listcontrol or treeview or something like but not as useful if you want to scale a single control while using other controls you indicate is your in that you would need to set the dock property on those other controls to or to have them float above or below your main resizing a hassle and it also limits the layout options of the other you can mitigate that problem by docking two panel one at the top and another at the bottom of the those panels will remain in fixed positions while the middle area your scales with the parent you can then put any controls in any layout configuration in those and kind of composite using docked panels is incredibly quite it was game changing in when they introduced this with the anchor property with all you want to do is have a single control on a form while others stay to the use the anchor for the controls that you want to stay at the set the anchor property to for controls that you want to stay at the set the anchor property to for controls that you want to grow in width with the as a textbox set the anchor property to set top or bottom depending whether you want it move as the top or the bottom of the dialog if you want a control to resize in all directions with a set the anchor property to very useful for type of such as a dominant tree or what you mess with the autosize or those properties control how a control changes size based on its own not how it resizes based on its think of mode as inward while are outward you get some very bizarre behavior if you use both sizing methods at the same generally not

 are two timer related functions on the windows settimer and killtimer the names are odd createtimer and destroytimer would be more as in createwindow and but that is what is can function in one of two the timer event can trigger a user defined callback or it can post a message to a the format of this function settimer use a settimer get a message to a settimer both the calling thread needs to have a message queue as both variants issue a the default handler calls the callback on the os using the value of interval has upper and lower the api for more release the timer after finished with it do the following if you provided a window is if you used a single window can have many timers associated with use a different for each reusing an stops the first instance of the timer without posting the fairly easy to latency between interval end and processing of resolution is requires a message processing

 argue that this problem is simple to when viewed in the proper you care about order of the only whether they appear in a subset of the number of times each element appears in the for the one element set how many subsets are clearly there are only two now suppose we added another that is distinct from to form the set we can form the list of all sets very take all the sets that we formed using only and add in zero or one copy of in we double the number of clearly we can use induction to show that for n distinct the total number of sets is just that some elements appear multiple consider the set with three copies of thus how many subsets can you this is we can have or 3 copies of so the total number of subsets is 4 since order does not for n copies of the element we will end up with possible expand this by adding in some of copies of so we have n copies of a and m copies of how many total subsets are this seems clear to every possible subset with only a in it were of we can add between 0 and m copies of the total number of subsets when we have n copies of a and m copies of b is it must be we can use an inductive argument to show that the total number of subsets is the product of such merely count up the total number of replicates for each distinct add and take the what happens with the set we get the set we get

 array is an ordered list of all of the same indexed by see in in note that in fortran array indexing is more flexible than most other low level in that instead of a single index per you can have an index triplet consisting of lower upper and in that case the lvalue of the expression is a subarray rather than a single element of the array derived type is a composite type defined by the which is made up of multiple components which can be of different in some other languages these are knows as structure or record see in in can also make an array of a derived or you can have a derived type where one or more components are themselves or for that other derived up to easiest way to check your code is to try to compile making it past the compiler is of course no guarantee that the program works as but it certainly is a required

 asking for communications what really talking about is a hidden agenda in your specific bosses with hidden agendas are a tricky and sometimes dangerous sometimes that agenda can be sometimes it can be something your task is to get them to admit what the agenda while keeping their feathers need to both physically supporting paperwork and god forbid visual and if just getting some mental preparation will if you may be faced with generating performance failing to prepare is preparing to your target specific and keep the list small and if you have more than 5 asking for the average person handles only simultaneous at a and you want to vex them with need to set aside at least 15 if you get done it will be seen as a positive thing completed the meeting early and went on to other good warning you get more than 5 or they think that the 5 minute manager means everything is answered in 5 minutes or this is a bad really and you will not be able to break through your work issues because your boss has more or less erected a permanent i know this but if you get a time slot with them take your lunch with need to get your boss to agree to stop moving around at this i get to sit still and and not be distracted by other close the office door and keep it distractions are the unintended adhd syndrome of bosses and even a missed cell phone call can break a train of leading to heck i just get back to as an excuse to get out of the the whole point of getting time with them is to get their their on what you are trying to you are ready to communicate keep one rule in only speak when absolutely unless absolutely needed to confer the information your boss or if needed to keep the communication even bother openning your was remarkably in this is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all this you need to approach and breach the you will want to do so in a you want to do so without generating the feeling that anyone you or your boss is at fault for the be presenting the issue in a manner that encourages you want this to be a positive impression and you will want to keep this the slightest hint of negative can often turn against i cannot give this enough negative and even negative are weapons in the hands of a bad boss with a bad agenda that targets do give them it will devolve into an opportunity to use any of this against wanna puke with the constant and but trust me on to put the thumbscrews to you if everything they try to use against you is a hopefully that the case and just a situation where a and this meeting will set you both on the right technical unless something going to hear over the long think of remember when was trendy how would you like it if your boss latched on to this term and used it for the next you cringe less and feel better when they if they used the correct this is the corollary to the when maxim above everything you say will be under a brilliant spotlight for a few and verbal gaffs will stick around long that they know what it is you assume that they also may harbor or any one of thousands of other personal or political also consider that they may be filtering what you say through those and get them to clearly define what they consider to be it might be something entirely different from what is called for in and that will touch back on the agenda just if their definition sounds even slightly do not let it ask them to clarify or provide additional what you want to accomplish is to get them to admit what their hidden agenda is in a polite manner that threaten it is sparkling what their agenda be sure to repeat it back to just to make sure i have it down you said you want accomplished by means of xyz within a given timeframe that you repetition back to them will give them a sense that their communcation was effective and provide a positive bosses like this because they feel their intentions are conveyed so this is a good should give you the critical insight have a better understanding of their expectations and like it or part of your job is to set if their expectations are or completely disconnected from the reality of the it falls to you to provide informative feedback that focuses on what they need to accomplish not if that feedback shows that their expectation is quickly it on their all needed is exactly that a on their part of what is really needed and really going the goal here is to start and establish an unbroken chain of communication between you and and that communication will only help everyone out over the long by this point you get a sense of what it is that they are then the situation is truly dire and not in a good working situation at either the boss is incompetent by lack of effective communication to their or they are not even close to competent in the field they are working or they have a hidden agenda that is adverse to either way on your way out in the long thank them for their assure them that the meeting was and and drop the whole in the stick it out and do the best you but start looking on your personal for work i truly hope this the but i have been in this situation at least and while pretty clear better off just getting out while you this on your good

 basically manage all your memory according to the management programming guide for in you basically only need to worry about objects that you you own an object if you create it you create an object by specifically allocating it using or copying it using or one of their if you own an you are responsible for releasing it when you are finished with other object not owned by if you need to use such an object for any extended period outside the scope in which you received you need to specifically take ownership of the object by either sending it a message or copying answer your last if you are creating a lot of temporary objects in a loop or some other you can create your own autorelease see the for nsautoreleasepool for more information about using please that you should really only do this after profiled your application and found that it is using too much memory and would benefit from this kind of if you are creating and releasing a lot of heavy objects and want to rely on autorelease you can specifically allocate and initialize them and then make sure to release them on your own as soon as finished with most objects that have convenience creators have similar initializers for creating the object

 be you blame it all on ie microsoft certainly is by far the worst part of the problem with such large standards is that too much of a moving target to be perfectly implemented in a timely the release cycles of web browsers do not coincide with the release of new web so all browser developers can do is try to implement as many features as they can from the latest w3c selecting what will be the most commonly used features to implement things are clearly and it possible to support and still use proper css take a look at comparison of layout engines css if you look at the overall see that most browsers do tend to comply with established standards in the it just takes some browsers longer than others to implement a standard after its sometimes not that one browser is than with new standards the problem is often that different development teams chose to adopt of the new so even though css3 is already beginning to be implemented by most probably have to wait until css4 is published before seeing consistent support across all major rendering and if you try to use the latest css3 features right have a hard time establishing compatibility across all major but if using features introduced in no problem at the only from using ugly css to stick with then the problem is no longer to conform to web standards while supporting a particular instead the problem simply becomes to resist the urge to use the latest greatest css from the only permanent solution i see to this recurring situation is for the w3c to different parts of newly introduced specifications so that the new features can be implemented in discrete phases synchronized across all the major for grammar rules might be given the highest priority along with a set deadline for its after that would come the second which could be element attribute and so on and so would require a tremendous level of cooperation between the w3c and development but it would be worth after it does users and web developers no good for ie to implement one subset of features from css3 while firefox implements a different subset and the webkit browsers yet another a is no good until actually across all the major rendering better for each browser to support fewer new features but have them all be same than for them to separately introduce a ton of their own features that universally

 believe is the self variable passed to is an object of type but the simply overwriting the self variable with the structure stored in instead invoke a set operator for the image property of object in the matlab documentation there is a class with a method called that illustrates the following line in your function savingmyobject may be think it might make most sense make the code a little if you used the name in place of the word within your class code the documentation tends to appear to be any kind of special keyword in matlab it may be in other just another variable as far as i can the prospect of having to set each property individually in your method sound like one way around it is if you have a set method for your object that is designed like the method for handle that set command can accept a structure input where each field name is a property name and each field value is the new value for that then you would have one call a bit especially if you have lots of properties to of then have to the new set method for your but the shortened syntax may be worth the extra work if it comes in handy elsewhere may be able to use the loop suggested in conjunction with a i throw a warning or potentially just do

 believe the factory method design pattern is appropriate for what trying to but not sure how much responsibility of subclasses it to give the example of using the method at wikipedia describes the situation in almost class imagereaderfactory public static imagereader inputstream is int imagetype is imagetype case return new is case return new is question what does the function look in this specific i would assume that it checks a file header in the to determine which image format the data is i would like to know if the itself knows how to parse file headers and determine if the file type is or if it calls a function inside each class that lets it know what type of image it something like return else return seems like having the factory know how to parse images breaks and letting the subclasses decide which one should be created is part of the factory method design it also seems like the function is just adding some redundant because why not just have each subclass perform its check on the in the function and skip the switch had any experience using factories and i was hoping to get some insight from some people who have used them in the past on the best way to handle this is it okay to have the factory know about the inner workings of its or should they be responsible for letting the factory know which to and how do you organize it does a factory know which type of object to

 believe the java stack is actually very there are a few reasons explaining the low productivity of java enterprise it is often used to create applications in tend not to attract great who love and think and care about what they the quality of software in the enterprise world is not the enterprise stack where the money software vendors try to sell something to they create complex and expensive solutions not because they are but simply because they could sell them to are often very risk averse and everything they do better be standards are created either some technology proved to be successful or in both bad for enterprises enterprises end up using either good technology too late or a downright failed the latter case is also very dangerous because it creates a false perception that a technology a complete must be good if it is standardized and everyone is using java ee platform seemed to have attracted a lot of architecture astronauts and developers in big companies promoted to architects whose only purpose was to create more more more abstractions and more not that there are no good java tools and that there are too many bad too many too many bureaucratic processes and too many useless such a messy world not just the particular selection of tools you choose that affects your mainly about about your about how you can reject the majority of solutions proposed to you by the and about you going against the about common about questioning every mainstream belief and tools alone are not going to change your productivity and the right people can be productive with inferior tools use a technology only because because everyone uses or because officially recommended by use a technology only if you personally think the best tool for your this way you may find yourself rejecting technologies such as web it use your common question do you really need to publish your objects for remote do you really need to create another abstraction layer so that you can switch from hibernate to do you really need to convert your data xml ten times every time you need do you really need xml do you really need everything to be configurable are at by the process be do you really need that do you really need to describe every screen in a huge have it type it in to some tool and then generate do you have competent programmers or you design everything first and programmers only to design of html programming in general this includes as and as programming drawing page flow code generation is a framework prior to using always a frameworks that have only little xml for low loc look at actual in your is every character what can you do to make your code do you need that what does it why do you need to do is not sacred you need 100 test test only what makes if difficult to make it or test it at test visual some concrete java presentation layer try why do i love because with tapestry you can create beautiful designed specifically for so that code can be by beautiful i mean everything that matters easy to easy to easy to create your and still it try to hide the fact that you are developing for the of still who makes your code free to use especially for crud and large bother with not a silver bullet with orm you are always going to trade one set of problems with a little you need much since carefully avoided all the java ee use dependency injection all of you may find the java language too verbose and not very helpful when abstracting away you if you want to try the problem is that the main selling point of scala is that you get all the benefits of modern languages while still keeping type and at the same there is no ide being used to java it make much sense to switch to scala unless an ide support that is stable and stable enough is not

 believe verifyall belongs to the older style of using where you would have a record step and a playback after which you would verify all in this model you would during the record step set up an expectation expect that this method will be called with parameters and newer versions of rhinomocks introduce syntax as the preferred using this it makes more sense to use assertions at the end of your test it is still possible to use but personally i think it reads easier if all of your assertions happen in a block at the end of the i guess the answer me is that it is personal see the link above where he has several examples of the same test and choose the one that reads best to

 believe you can do this and would you want to distinguish between an app a web container is the reason for determining this to allow your pojos to behave differently in different environments if so then i think this points to an structure that is not quite or at least where the object responsibilities are not clearly	
 believe you can only feel the difference after been in a big project and seen how much mess webforms approach could seen a page contains multiple user some of them living independent lives like or all these rules passing through multiple control layers which cannot be traced until been in a project for many long years at least have smoked something reeealy good before diving in with the debugger you begin to appreciate the possibility for a clearly defined flow of control when you see how your data defines what components with what properties are rendered on a also loved webforms for a long i also disliked first few mvc for exactly same reasons you put after done some coding and could compare the i began to enjoy there are some areas where mvc approach would be much more complicated and create more mess than webforms come with not really a long

 believe you need rather than you would pass it where you might other wise pass assuming that is you could do the statusofevent would need to accept it as a valid input for this if using some support like an xsd dataset to describe the stored you can modify this to change the parameter to accept from then you should be able to pass and the underlying system will convert this to for in that you can leave the call should also work with to change the stored representation in your linq2sql you need to open your dbml and edit the properties for the stored

 benefit of that notation in was to make it easier to see what a type was without having to go search for the these styles appeared before the arrival of intellisense and to we often had to go on a goose chase looking for the declaration in who knows how many header on a large project this could be a significant annoyance which was bad enough when looking at c source but even worse when doing forensics using mixed code and a raw call faced with these using and all the other hungarian rules starts to make some sense even with the maintenance overhead because of how much time it would save just in looking up a type when looking at unfamiliar now of course we have intellisense and to so the main time saving motivation of that naming convention is no longer i think much point in doing that any and i generally try to go with the library guidelines just to be consistent and possibly gain a little bit more tool

 best links i found for learning about cas you can find on delicious page on the cas is the security sandbox for local apps typically have full trust which means they can do apps that are hosted in the browser do in just about any security setting can be using great control over what apps can even within the context of the logged in the best part about is that security checks walk the so that even if some code has permission to do if that method was called by another program that have permission to do that request will fail special measures are a pretty complex beast to lots of but hopefully the links provided will lead you to learn whatever details you need to	
 best other than a distributed version is using rsync over i keep a couple of machines in sync by doing the following on each ssh mentioned using a macbook rsync is on mac os as far as i it need to be installed and the beauty of rsync is that it looks for modifications and only copies modified files it do merging of simultaneous modifications like a distributed version control system but if like me where you do some work on your laptop then some work on your rsync is the best way to send all the changed files only the changed from one to the other when you switch

 best solution have already been i just want to add some simplest solution is to have a counter and increment on every new this works quite well as long as only one thread creates new if multiple processes or even systems add new things get a bit more you must coordinate the creation of new ids with locking or any similar synchronisation you could also assign id ranges to every proceses to reduce the synchronisation or extend the file id by a unique process better solution might be to use guids in this scenario and do not have to care about synchronisation between you can at some random data to every identifier to make them harder to guess if this is a coommon is storing files in a directory structure where the location of a file depends on its file might be stored as this avoids directories with a huge number of i am not really aware why this is done may be file system performance issues but it is quite i do not know if similar things are common if the files are stored directly in the

 best valid and normal usage for regex is for email address format a good application of have used regular expressions countless times as in textpad to massage flat create csv create sql insert statements and that sort of written regular expressions be too usually the like tons of calls to replace are far slower might as well do it in one situations call for exactly regular expressions and nothing special characters with innocuous characters is another good can of course imagine that there are some codebases that overuse regular expressions to the detriment of i have never seen that i have actually been eschewed by code reviewers for not using regular expressions	
 best way for tou to understand this different null values is to try them and see what the use of each one but to make things simple here is some can be used only on reference types like collections and custom classes is is for null values that came out of the db we cant assign null to a decimal or double we assign them with the minvalue property are value is a way for the developer to assign null values to value objects like is same as hope i helped you understanding the

 best way to pick up any language in my experience is through when i started reading about i found it so similar to java that i really see the differences until i actually started writing some you may experience the same thing when looking at done any vb in but one thing that always took me by surprise is the way short circuit evaluation is if you write in you know that is only evaluated if is if you write a and then both and are to get the behavior used to you need to use instead of

 birch has a good idea with using triggers and a you can find out more in the create trigger are you sure that you need to call an executable right away when the row is it seems like that method will be prone to because mysql might spawn multiple instances of the executable at the same if your executable then there will be no record of which rows have been processed yet and which have if mysql is waiting for your executable to then inserting rows might be very if chad birch is then will have to recompile so it sounds of calling the executable directly from i would use triggers to simply record the fact that a row got inserted or record that information in the either with new columns in your existing tables or with a brand new table called say then make an external program that regularly reads the information from the processes and marks it as specific solution will depend on what parameters the external program actually your external program needs to know which row was then your solution could be like make a new table called with fields and and for all the other make a trigger like trigger insert on each row insert into values your batch script can do something like the first row in the until is this you can have more control over when and how the data gets and you can easily check to see whether the data actually got processed check to see if the table is	
 bit of background might be tweak was a research effort trying to bring some of the great things from etoys to the system level the the concurrency asynchronous notifications tweak was a approach to composition and scripting and in some ways never really intended to be a production that it became one was its downfall because it polished enough for wide use and by becoming a production tool it became infeasible to implement some of the radical changes that would have been required to make it ready for world dominance had an entirely different we needed croquet because we needed a replicated computation croquet computes on all platforms which required modifications to the virtual machine and some libraries as floating cobalt is a from croquet which takes the sdk and builds an application from in this sense cobalt is not really a fork it is the current focus of the croquet

 both like and dislike are great for organising code into general areas such as etc and then hiding them away great for stuff like control development were there are usually a lot of properties with and be used if following a notify property change they are great when you are implementing several interfaces and you want to group the interface implementations separately from the main they do get in the way when you want to see the entirety of the code or you are browsing through it looking for and even worse when someone code and they agree with your conventions for naming and grouping i would like to see is an easily accessible feature in visual studio that allowed a and toggling option so i could have the best of both worlds when it suited perhaps such things will be easy to implement as extensions to the ide in	
 both of the types are statically typed to there is zero difference between the both will resolve down to the member is what does for if the objects are not strongly typed to visual basic late binding will kick in and go two very different the version will attempt to do an operation which literally tries to add the this will do all manner of attempts to convert both values to a number and then add operator will attempt to the visual basic runtime will go through all manner of conversions to convert both values to it will then the	
 both projects have the same priority for the one obvious reason is for project managers to give higher management the illusion that both of the projects are taken care that the two projects could belong to different customers be requested by different people from higher customer wants to be told to wait while a different project is given leave the other one for a lot of not an acceptable even though this leads to delays for both believe this is related to the notion of in a software even if something takes more time to it looks faster when it appears to be doing instead of idly waiting for some other stuff to

 both validators to the textbox and set them based on the user a custom validator that takes the dropdownlist into account maybe wrap it all into a custom i think i prefer option but have to try it to see how well it really works in the browser easy or is it possible to swap the enabled validator in want to the validator because that has to be done server side and that means doing a post back when the user changes the dropdownlist selection to set the correct validator you can validate the both of my suggested solutions avoid

 brian above said for subversion would also let you do commit hooks that could do substitution for of this i think the problem in the svn world is that you really modify the what the svn book hook scripts can do almost there is one dimension in which hook script authors should show do not modify a commit transaction using hook while it might be tempting to use hook scripts to automatically correct errors or shortcomings or policy violations present in the files being doing so can cause subversion keeps caches of certain bits of repository and if you change a commit transaction in this those caches become indetectably this inconsistency can lead to surprising and unexpected instead of modifying the you should simply validate the transaction in the hook and reject the commit if it does not meet the desired as a your users will learn the value of work there any reason you do this during the build process with ant or

 browser has a provider this is basically a chain of classes that get called in a particular order for each for example we providers new order of the providers in the list is higher order providers take precedence over lower order i have tried to make this portion so a third party dll can define its own providers that will get injected in our problem is that once you allow for 3rd parties to inject themselves in the chain you lose a central place to define this current solution that i am a little uncomfortable with is to define a optional priority attribute with each provider and then order by the for example i now allows 3rd parties to define their position in the solutions i thought about were before and after attribute imagefrommedialocationprovider i am not sure if this is easier or harder to program there any other solutions to this which solution would you go i should just keep the list for the core providers and add the attribs for third party providers way to annotate provider

 bug correction rates are a valid metric in some they can be misguiding in some bugs are obviously a lot more difficult to fix than you may want to try include sorting your bugs into different base the sorting on metrics such as difficulty to importance to the or an agile environment you are mostly focused on writing test think about he life cycle of a one of the first things you try to do is reproduce you can measure how far along you are to fixing a bug if you can write a test case against doing just this will improve bug correction

 building a heavily crud based website and got to the phase of the project where trying to build a search webpage that shows the user different subsets of a certain important table based on parameters they enter such as dates and different text use a fixed sql because depending on whether they search by date or by something the sql would be so instead i have been generating a results list using a table web control that starts out invisible and then is filled and set to visible once the user identifies a search they want to i used a table control because its easy to create and modify in the code and i was able to make the needed calls to the database and populate that table as the second thing i need with this search is the ability to allow the user to select a record from the results and then go edit it using the rest of the crud based pages on the to do i created in the table and gave them all different ids and the same event but since i created the buttons it seems the event disappears on callback and my scheme so taking a second look at how to do current code for the events looks tempcell new button tempbutton new new results table is declared like like to be able to identify which record the user so i can send that info on to another and of i still need to be able to generate results for several different search currently i have template and code based searches that lead to different stored procedures and different parameters based on what the user has suggestions on it seems like the data grids and repeaters require sql statements in advance to work so not sure how to use but if i could then the item command approach would work with the is the best approach for this crud search page in

 built an online news portal before which is working fine for me but some say the home page is slow a little when i think of it i see a reason why that home page of the site displays news with pictures read news commented news news titles from each news category in total each of these are seperate queries to the i have tableadapters datasets and datatables data acces so for i call the business logic in my news class that returns the datatables by the from there i either use the datatable by just binding it to the controls or of the the object converts it to a for example and i consume it from this for each of the above seems to work fine at least it does not put a huge but makes me wonder if there is a better the project i describe above is a highly dynamic web news are inserted as they arrive from agencies 24 hours so caching in this case might not sound but on the other i know have another similar project for a local the site will only be updated once a in this i only run one that would return a datatable containing all the news items inserted for then query that datatable and place spots and other items to their respective places on the or is there a better alternative i just wander how other people carry out similar tasks in the most efficient access

 business model was actually rampant during the dot com company a thought it would provide an email service for free and once it has a million users it could other services or add on some premium if even users sign on that would still generate a good residual monthly income from a 100k but as soon as company a goes premium another company would come out with the same model offering the same services for free and company model company a then might resort to increasing switching costs and locking people in though email has a high switching cost this work but another reason i bring this up is that this is exactly what you could be facing down the you could make a strong case for sustaining for 5 years but if a company comes out 4 years from now and does a really good job of the same just lost a lot of time and money but they got in even if your switching costs are high and your users are locked entirely possible that the new company might offer a migration path to circumvent just this and you could then take measures to really hijack the data but not that easy and it would lead to negative publicity from frustrated users feel their data is theirs to your question is quite i provide much feedback but unless the scenario is really compelling a hard road to tread even if larry page approached me with a search engine want to know the monetization strategy patents provide a safety is also the question of employee employees get nice perks and bonuses because always strapped for cash and they always feel that the reward is too far you will end up giving out a lot of stock options and raising multiple rounds of investments which be gives you a safety net in that when five years from now it becomes you can execute on your idea and still have and even if you fail to execute execute you may take comfort in the fact that someone else might be able to execute while you can get if you really want to get this thing out you might be able to throttle your costs by making it an beta so you end up mushrooming your it will also provide you with a platform that you can mature over the years and as hardware becomes more affordable you can continue to issue more

 can give a negative answer to part of that question right there any way to arrange generics so that will so that it can be called with the arguments of most restrictive would mean that the java would pass up generic information the way up the chain determine what the allowable to dostuff could and i if it has that simple answer is because the actual extend type of that chain are only known at run and by then any information about generics has been lost through push it even if you had a checked type instead of vanilla with a method that could pass up in the chain the actual type you could do a check at and raise a runtime but it will never be a compile unless the actual final type is known maybe by a second type in the compiler is not going to be able to help you you can should do is keep with what you just wrote should compile just and pass it an argument that can be whether you it or let the jvm raise a classcastexception is remains a matter of

 can never properly evaluate the security of a system by looking at a single part of it in whereabouts are you storing the key to decrypt the the people that have access to the database also have access to the location you are storing the encyption if so only gained a minor improvement in security by encrypting the passwords and probably nothing much more to gain by encrypting the the decryption key and program using it are more secure than the database which is pretty normally the database is in the most secure spot possible then there would possibly be additional benefit to also encrypting the username as be depriving attackers of useful information in brute force

 can see the growth of systems using peer to peer there is an area where peer to peer is not widely web projects are already but there is no big solution which would permit users to use and to contribute to a peer to peer mean projects google web which use google not but open where each user contribute to the hosting of the global web hosting by letting its ressources be can think of several assets of such load storage why such a system is not yet widely used think that the plz problem occurs because all users do not seed all the but if a system where all users equally contribute to all the content is this problem does not occur peer to peer storage systems are thanks to problem of proprietary code is as well of the fact that an user might not know which content he is for your add another the latency wich may be higher than with a dedicated confidentiality of code and data can be achieved by for with all files are and i think there is no known security breach in this system i might be true that seeders would not have many or it would prevent people from beeing dependent of web hosting such a decentralized way to host websites is closer of the original idea of the i is p2p web hosting not widely

 can understand how one can write a program that uses multiple processes or a new process and use or create multiple threads and use those sorts of communication also understand context that with only once the operating system schedules time for each process there are tons of scheduling algorithms out and thereby we achieve running multiple processes now that we have processors we could have two processes running simultaneously on two separate question is about the last how does the kernel control which core a process runs which system calls or even schedule a process on a specific reason working on a project for school where we are to explore a recent topic in computing and i chose there seems to be a lot of material on how to program in that kind of environment to watch for deadlock or race but not much on controlling the individual cores i would love to be able to write a few demonstration programs and present some assembly instructions or c code to the effect of i am running an infinite loop on the 2nd look at the spike in cpu utilization for specific code or for clarification many people have said that this is the purpose of the and that one should let the os take care of i completely but then what asking trying to get a feel is what the operating system actually does to do not the scheduling but more a core is what instructions must be executed to have that core start fetching to control which core a process runs

 certainly not the only but i do hope part of a declining trend problem with hungarian notation is that trying to implement a type system via naming this is extremely problematic because a type system with only human every human on the project has to agree to the same set of do rigorous code reviews and ensure that all new types are assigned the appropriate and correct in impossible to guarantee consistency with a large enough code at the point there is no consistency why are you doing tools support hungarian that might seem like a stupid comment on the surface but consider refactoring for each refactoring in a hungarian naming convention system must be accompanied with a mass rename to ensure that prefixes are mass renames are susceptible to all sorts of subtle of using names to implement a type just rely on the type it has automatic verification and tool newer make it much easier to discover a type hover etc and really remove the original desire for hungarian

 code because using locking without making the field unfortunately have a volatile so you apply the normal just acquire the lock every time or use static initialization to initialize when the type is singleton for a general discussion of this with regards to singletons i know this a but the page gives but it should be fairly easy to i generally recommend making lock variables you really want to be changing the value general static properties okay to lock on a static variable initialize it like you are try to write or code unless you know what i regard myself as reasonably knowledgeable about and i still try using locking initialization is a few caveats if you have complex initializers which end up referencing each so a good time to do initialization like this then you really need a you need to make the type a just write function to initialize the list and return then use that function in the initializer for the this has to be declared as the initializer will execute in textual order just create the array inside buildregexes and have it as a field at unless you need the array that would be a better shared readonly as string shared readonly as shared readonly property as return end shared function as dim list new for each exp as string in or or return

 combing a log file for statements that stand of the lines are similar and pass them through unix however that filters as all the lines are slightly they all have a different similar statements might print a different user a way tool to get just the lines that are notably different from any not precise was thinking about playing with but that seems geared toward diffing two rather than all pairs of lines in the same assumed the solution would give a uniqueness score for each so by i i choose a threshold that the uniqueness score must exceed for any line to be included in the on if there are other viable ways to define please the method have to have accuracy and prefer answers that are as general purpose as i know i can strip away the timestamp at the stripping the end is more as its language may be absolutely unlike anything else in the these sorts of details are why i shied from concrete examples but because some people info info info cache 3466 info cache 4352685 info info cache 3466 the different 1 like both lines returned but not other lines like in other those 2 lines are distinct types i can later ask for only statistically rare line the edit distance is much bigger between those for one lines that stand out in a but exact

 commented on post that i feel his answer is the if the goal is just to avoid two database then just in for a world of unnecessary your reference to if you are looking instead for a solution to that allows you to defer official saving in some you may wish to have a look at the function in the inner function is how the delayed save is accomplished for implementing something for models without forms would basically follow the same said and coming back to the case of a modelform and an actual model are somewhat because forms expose only a set of data to be edited in a browser because it is filtered in some or excludes critical fields that a user be it is a reasonable design expectation that someone might need to add important information to the model before this is why django has the expectation falls down for cases where you are directly instantiating here you have programmatic access to the model so you will probably find that using that api directly is easier to maintain and less error prone than through generalized i can understand why you are picturing the factory but in this case you may find the effort to create a generalization for all manner of models is a complication just not worth

 compiler will emit and if you define a so really just save some has been an interesting this is something from my favorite book via is what i i like and i wish that they were supported in the framework and its the reason is properties look like fields but are this has been known cause a phenomenal amount when a programmer code that appears to be accessing there are many assumptions that the programmer makes that not be true for a property may be or field access is readable and if you a it is best to offer get and set accessor property method may throw an field access never an property cannot be passed as an out or ref parameter to a field property method can take a long time to field access completes a reason to use properties is perform thread which can stop the thread a property should not used if thread nization in that a method is if your class can be accessed remotely your class is derived the property method will be and a method preferred to a in classes derived marshalbyrefobject should never called multiple times in a a property method may a different value each field returns the same value the class has a only now property that the current date and each time you query this it return a different this is and microsoft wishes they could fix the class by now a method instead of a property method may cause observable side field access never in other a user of a type should be able to set properties defined by a type in order he or she chooses noticing any different behavior the property method may require additional memory or return reference to something that is actually part of the so modifying the returned object no effect on the original querying a field always returns reference to an object that guaranteed to be part of the original working with property that returns a copy can very confusing to this characteristic is frequently not

 consist on hiding a base class method with a new definition in a child difference between hiding and overriding has to do with the way methods are when a virtual method is the call address for the method call table of the base class is replaced with the address of the child the other when a method is a new address is added to the method call table of the child a call is made to the method in method call table class type is if we are invoking with a reference to the base class then the base class method table is if we have a reference to the child then the child class method table is method is searched in the if found then the invocation takes otherwise the base class method table is we invoke the method with a reference to the child class then the behavior is the if the method has been the method address will be found in the base if the method was hidden the method address will be found on the child and since it has been already base class table will not be we invoke the method with a reference to the base class then behavior when as the method address overwrites base class we will call the child even when holding a reference to the base with the base class method table is the only one visible as we hold a reference to the base contains the virtual method and the base class method will be general shadowing is a bad as it introduces a difference on the behavior of an instance depending on the reference we have to

 could make a object that uses the table and go from there or you a friend as a partial entity name and and pull the user object into the friend like this last model better because it allows you to represent friends more you would still have a copy of the friend name if it is a duplicate of the user and the id to identify if the user is gone or keeps the concept a little further away from the concept and any security i will argue appropriate to duplicate the field as it adds flexibility and information about a user that used to take on you would still have to eventually back to the user but perhaps not as if you really hate to anything you can have a person object that friend and user both refer to for i think that is a nice theoretical but not worth the complexity it would introduce into the bulk of your code of it being talking about the user and talking about the i would make the user easy to talk about and the friend a little not this i enjoyed mentally toying with this

 current language design philosophy is that nullability should be something a programmer is forced to ask not given by default on reference types i agree with tony hoare google for his recent qcon this specific with the unnullable it even pass static conservative analysis cannot guarantee that b2 so the program is not semantically ethos is simple references are an indirection handle to some which we can traverse to obtain access to that nullable references are an indirection handle to a a notification that the resource is not and one is never sure up front which semantics are being this gives either a multitude of checks up front it or the inevitable npe most programming resources these not massively resource constrained or bound to some finite underlying model null references one just bung a null in which i have too much sympathy know what to put in here typically also a legacy of older where you had to declare your resource names before you knew what your resources went a better error reporting mechanisms are thus essential in a know have something give me a this has more and we can think of ways to combat solving each of the cases that null current caters for with a better linguistic choice is no small and may add more confusion that it we can always go to immutable so null in only useful states and much real imperative technqiues are here to stay and frankly glad this makes the search for better solutions in this space

 currently researching methods for storing user roles and permissions for based some of these projects are web some are currently struggling to find the best method to achieve what looking for in a portable way across project looking to leverage active directory as our single point of contact for basic user because of looking to not have to maintain a custom database for each users since they are already stored in active directory and actively maintained we want to write our own security if possible and would like to use something like the security application blocks provided by projects require only basic such as or no other projects require more complex users of those applications might be granted access to some but not and their permissions can change across each an administration section of the app would control and define this the ad using integrated windows authentication to perform authentication on our this works well for finding out basic user and seen that can be extended to provide an active directory roles so i can find out any security groups a user belongs what seems like the downfall of this method to me is that everything is stored in active which could lead to a mess to maintain if things grow too this same also heard of active directory lightweight directory which seems like it could extend our schema and add only application specific attributes and problem i find anything on how this would be done or how this there are msdn articles that describe how to talk to this instance and how to create a new but nothing ever seems to answer my question based on your am i going down the right is what looking to do possible using just active or do other tools have to be methods looked multiple files a custom security model and database to manage users across group and role management in with active

 depends on what is important to your you short change but if you you should also ask yourself this your application there to handle or does the data transcend your other if the code part of your application blew up but your data is still how bad of a disaster would it if you answer can always write the code to replace the but without the you had better make sure that your data is because it will probably outlive any code you write not to say you put a great amount of effort into writing a solid but the code is ultimately transient whereas your data is if stuck with bad you can but if you have bad it will likely have much broader the other if the data is really only there to make sure that your code works and the code itself is more important inverse of the above you should ensure that you have a good and revisit any deficiencies in the data most enterprise the data are far more i have worked on conversion projects in the past where the code was far past its but migration was delayed for so long because the data was so bad that it took a significant and very discretionary effort to get the data to a point of health where it could be

 dictionaries of dictionaries are useful for other than performance they allow you to store context information about the data without having extra fields on the objects and make querying subsets of the data terms of memory it would stand to reason that one large dictionary will use less ram than multiple smaller if nesting each additional layer of nesting will roughly double the number of dictionaries you need to terms of query multiple dicts will take longer due to the increased number of lookups i think the only way to answer this question is for you to profile your own my suggestion is to use the method that makes your code the cleanest and easiest to of all the features of dictionaries are probably the most heavily tweaked for optimal

 difference between the golomb coding and binary code is that binary code is not a prefix which is a for coding strings of arbitrarily large numbers cannot decide if 1010101010101010 is a concatenation of 10101010 and 10101010 or something they are not that easily the golomb code is optimal for geometric in this case with parameter the probability of 42 is some so you get the idea about how important is this for the length of the output

 doing sounds pretty good to capacity is cheap and minimising network usage is you could have the server for each what last dataset and send only the differences a list of deletions and on each if you sort your data rows these differences can be calculated fairly efficiently using a differencing algorithm such as that used by approach is sensitive to network outages if one response is not received by the errors will however this can be remedied by having the client sent the md5 hash with each if it is different than what the server an entire list will be sent instead of a list of

 doubt you will have any hard data on so i will add some thoughts on you use di other solid because it helps you do its the other way you do tdd because it helps you with the design which usually means you get code that follow those why to use interfaces is a different will assume you agree that having your classes do many different things results in messy i am assuming you are already going for you have different classes that do specific you need a way to relate if you relate them inside the classes the you get plenty of code that uses specific versions of the this means that making changes to the system will be are going to need to change the a fact of software you can call yagni about not adding specific extra but not on that you be needing to change the in my case something really important as i do weekly use a di framework where configuration is done through with a really small code you hook up lots of different when you take away the discussion on interface concrete you are actually saving typing not the other way also for the cases a concrete class is on the it hooks it up automatically have to building the rest of the it also allows me to control some objects life in particular i can configure an object to be a singleton and it hands a single instance all the note that just using these practices more using them for the first is what causes the overhead of the learning process in some cases mind set you gonna need to put all those constructor calls all over the place to go

 dragon has a small section about what you use regular expressions detect repetition of a meaning you match constructs like where w is the same succesion of can only detect a fixed number of repetition or an unspecified number of which is to say you use an already parsed token to determine the number of something s1 s2 expressions be used to describe balanced or nested the set of strings of all balanced 1 and a simple you a substring so you can match it if you than you would be using a just think of how you would be using regular expressions for those and you will intuitively come to the conclusion you the same as the problem in for parsing string you just say a string literal is between the first and the second but what happens when an escaped for the relation to i think hunch is because the problem is limited introspection the book has references to the if you want i can look them up for	
 drawing strings using and even setting the text property of uilabels the text can sometimes appear slightly tend to use helvetica in most and i notice that specific font sizes cause some level of blurriness to both in the simulator and on the cause the resulting label to have slightly blurry in crisp question is why does this and is it just a matter of selecting an optimal font size for a if what are the optimal font it seems that perhaps it is not the font size that is causing the it may be that the center of the rect is a fractional here is a comment i found on the apple dev the likely on fractional change center to integer rounded off the values of all my but there are still places where text remains has anyone come across this issue and blurry

 easiest way of finding out how implemented is to try write some code which uses a captured compile then look at it in note that the which is not the one of the big differences between java and in this basic idea is that each level of scope containing at least one captured variable results in a new class with fields for the variables which have been if more than one then an inner scope also has a field for the next scope and so the genuine local variables on the stack end up being references to instances of the autogenerated an static void actions new for i int copyofi for j int copyofj foreach action in get different results if you take a copy of course this is compiled into code like static void actions new for i outerscope outer new for j innerscope inner new foreach action in class public int class public int public outerscope public void reference to the captured variable ends up going through the instance of the generated so not just a in this case nothing else in the code uses the captured but you can easily imagine it note how for any one iteration of the outer the five new instances all share one instance of you might want to try playing with extra code in the delegate to see how that affects things if the delegate changes that change will be seen in the next changes to be seen because the next delegate will be using a separate instance of

 event gets fired in my application from a combo box user chooses a in the combo or own code updates the to reflect combo box is now for a different am interested in the event for case so that i can update the current but in case i do not want the event to because the properties have not example may consider that i have a list box containing a list of people and i have a combo box representing the nationality of the currently selected person in the case 1 could happen if fred is currently selected in the and i use the combo box to change his nationality from english to case 2 could happen if i then select who is in the my list update code sees that bob is now and updates the combo box so that scottish is now the selected this causes the combo event to be fired to set nationality to even though it already is can i update my combo property without causing the event to one way would be to unregister the event set then the event but this seems tedious and error there must be a better between events raised by user interaction and my own

 for are pointers in disguise with some added syntactic pointers have any number of performance and efficiency aliasing is one notable the compiler guarantee that the memory underneath the pointer or reference is the same as the last time it read because any old pointer can go through and modify the compiler is forced to the value from memory on every use rather than caching it in most processors registers are memory accesses are so we never want to access memory if we can avoid primitive types often go into the compiler has complete control over what data resides in each register and can guarantee that nothing will overwrite the so variables of primitive types can potentially stay in registers for a long time until the compiler needs to write any changes back out to when dealing with primitive often less efficient to use a it disallows the compiler from caching the value in a inserts hidden and can open you up to performance issues arising from the efficiency important to you in this but you said you think of a good reason not to use the reference other than saving i submit there is a very good practice with this in in my would be to use references primarily for aggregate the compiler pass these around in a single register so the relative cost of using the reference is going to be heavily if the type in question is a primitive i would always prefer to work with a copy of the value rather than a

 for functional any time you have a common coding pattern and want to reduce a while ago i wrote a bit on using for functional while making sure functional hesitate to link to my own stuff but i think relevant in this if you have a common how expressions are lovely in pattern matching be too in there are tons of patterns that pop up at a coding using higher order you can make them go as i show in that set of blog my favourite example is the pattern is so common it got turned into a language same thing for those are both trivially represented as higher order and only because support them originally do we need language keywords to support switch your blocks out to use a readerwriter have to write a higher order function perhaps convincing just requires looking at generics aka parametric hardly but a nice functional concept everyone the cute ninject framework work without as expression how fluent get all their that come from oo or imperative the new threading pretty ugly without functional programming has been blessing things like over the last the major advances as are directly from functional why not realise something to it and get more involved in how phrase it to bigger is actually getting people to make the jump in understanding to higher order while quite if never seen it before in your it might be shocking an seems like a lot of people think generics are just for and linq is just embedded what you should do is go through your and find places that are an imperative search for the underlying and use functions to string it together if you find you might settle for just off for example all the foos in this list and remove a 1 line thing in functional style versus 7 lines in style a temp loop through and add loop though and remove the hope is even though the syntax is people will recognize a lot if they can put down the more and looks for a have a

 from a perspective you should be asking the difference between web applications and client within each you can ask about the difference between standard web applications and mobile web apps and standard client apps and mobile client difference between web and client applications is that web applications lack every page request is completely from every other page it is only through various technical that web applications manage to maintain the illusion that a web app user is running a coherent application as they navigate from page to in for the isapi dll manages a object that pulls a session cookie from the page request and then provides uses it to identify the session data appropriate for the handling of the a client by every aspect of the application is targeted at a single user and the of the application is a given as you navigate from dialog to in the tight integration of the application with the computer permits the use of resources in a web by there is little or no access to these resources except as mediated by the browser a client not a web web applications just web applications with two the screen size is considerably smaller and the browser capabilities are generally less write a mobile web app in pretty much the same way as a standard web app but you can not count on some of the capabilities that you usually have with a this last by the is rapidly going away as mobile devices become more applications require a development deployment that is specific to the mobile the tools and techniques used in standard client application development map particularly well to the mobile need to learn new controls and the only real exception to this rule are the tools available through microsoft has attempted to provide as much commonality as possible even find that you have a different mind set and different constraints than when developing a winforms this

 from the world of and learning been wondering about get and set functions in in usage of these are quite and tools like visual studio promote usage by making them very easy and quick to this seem to be the case in the the class private string public string get return set bar in class foo people will well whats the point in why not just create a public field and then make it a property later if you need actually not i just do it out of good practice because seen it done so many because so used to doing i feel like i should carry over the habit to my but is this really i see it done as often as with the from what i thanks for the tip void return i always wonder if using is good to me that seems like a whole lot of leg considering using visual tools the implementation would take literally seconds to and the took me a lot longer to type i feel its not worth the especially when the alternative is 5 lines what i these are the can change implementation details for the get and set so instead of returning a private field you can return something more can remove a later on and make it only for a public facing this not the ages to is this worth the generally in some the advantages make it worth the but i speaking in terms of is did i choose answer with less i was actually very close to choosing however my personal opinion is apparently is that the answer over egged the answer i on the other seems to argue both i think getters and setters evil if used excessively that i when not necessary and would break the business but why we have a function called this would be far more versatile than what if i wanted to show it to the user in another way than as the class wanted me in some sense may not be relevant enough to argue that and setters are because it have an accompanying and speaking of a function called could be bad my because it would imply to the implementer of the function that the account must be manipulated out side of the which is not a good get and set functions popular with

 functions almost never return a instead they return a or use special values to indicate error returns they store the error code in a which you can read with instructs the marshaler to read this variable after the native function and stash the error code where you can later read it with the idea is that the runtime may call other win32 functions behind the scenes which mess up the error code from your call before you get a chance to inspect which return a belong to a different level of abstraction than win32 generally these functions are or from so they use the win32 code might call win32 functions instructs the marshaler to check the return and if not a success to create and throw an exception containing the the managed declaration of your function then has as its return the or vb compiler cannot check the unmanaged so it has to trust whatever you tell if you put on a function which returns something other than a you will get strange results random if you put on a function which does not set the last win32 error you will get garbage instead of a useful error

 further information pretty hard to give any but assuming that the factory pattern is what you actually need you could try the following the needed arguments in some kind of property map map of string to and pass that as an argument to the create use tags as keys in the allowing the specialized factories to extract and interpret the mapped values to their own will at least allow you to maintain a single factory interface for the time and postpone dealing with architectural issues if you notice that the factory pattern the correct one and if you really want to use the factory pattern here i strongly suggest you make it pluggable to avoid having to modify the factory for each new label

 generally best practice to use named constants in place of magic but it sure is tedious and error prone keeping a database reference table and a file of named constants in is there some easy way to keep these two sources for this info in or am i overlooking an obvious design case my question an i have a reference table with 2 this table associates a usersstatusid 1 with the userstatus the user table relies on this table to normalize when querying for a status from i have two userstatusid from users where userstatus userstatusid from users where userstatus practice is to use the latter so the meaning of the number 1 is but this means i have to maintain a complete list of valid in my userstatus table and in my how do i avoid having to keep both the db reference table and my constants file using a centralized constants file so only 1 place i have to update for my but is there a way to avoid having to update a constants file at all when a new status in have one schedule a script to run once a day to populate a constants file via a query of the reference tables in the is this the best practice for keeping named constants in code and database reference tables in	
 generally considered to only catch the errors you are interested in the case of probably recent call no such file or you want to silently ignore that you would say you accidently pass the function an integer instead of a will give the error coercing to need string or int you probably want to ignore which can be difficult to you want to ignore all catch rather than a bare catches include the exception which for to the which correctly except you want to write ever better behaved the exception can represent various but in the example above we only want to ignore so we could be even more if suppress such file or reraise the as an unexpected could also and change the to

 going to develop my solution decomposing each transformation into a this both helps explain being and helps in debugging and essentially applying the principle of functional decomposition to database also going to do it without using oracle with sql that ought to run on any modern so no just subqueries and group me in the comments if it work on your the which since call since the id is not actually a unique call it the other columns are and table eid int not m y v int inserting the for two i select from eid m y v 100 1 2008 80 100 2 2008 80 100 3 2008 90 100 4 2008 80 200 1 2008 80 200 2 2008 80 200 3 2008 90 200 4 2008 80 rows in set we have one the represented as two that should really be one column a date or a or maybe even a foreign key to a table of so make it one do that as a linear such that it sorts the same as and such that for any tuple there is one and only and all values are create view as y 12 m as am from gives select from eid m y v am 100 1 2008 80 24097 100 2 2008 80 24098 100 3 2008 90 24099 100 4 2008 80 24100 200 1 2008 80 24097 200 2 2008 80 24098 200 3 2008 90 24099 200 4 2008 80 24100 rows in set use a in a correlated subquery to for each the earliest successor month in which the value base this view on the previous view we create view as select select from b where and and as from select from eid m y v am 100 1 2008 80 24097 24099 100 2 2008 80 24098 24099 100 3 2008 90 24099 24100 100 4 2008 80 24100 null 200 1 2008 80 24097 24099 200 2 2008 80 24098 24099 200 3 2008 90 24099 24100 200 4 2008 80 24100 null rows in set is now the of the first month the month of the current in which the null where there is no later for that in the is the same for all months leading up to the change in v occurs at we can group on and v of and in any the is the absolute month of the consecutive month that had that create view as select as am v from group by select from eid am v 100 24100 null 80 100 24097 24099 80 100 24099 24100 90 200 24100 null 80 200 24097 24099 80 200 24099 24100 90 rows in set this is the result set we which is why this view is called all lacking is something to transform absolute months back to do just join to the table are only two we want the month in our we have nulls where there is no next month in our to met the those should be single month these could actually be longer ranges than one but in every case they mean we need to find the latest month for the which from d where the views decompose the we could add in this month by adding another but just insert this into the which would be most efficient depends on how your rdbms optimizes get month join 1 we have a the op wants the month to be the same as the so just use coalesce on since last eliminates any our joins need to be outer select from a join b on and join c on and from d where order by eid m y m y v 100 1 2008 2 2008 80 100 3 2008 3 2008 90 100 4 2008 4 2008 80 200 1 2008 2 2008 80 200 3 2008 3 2008 90 200 4 2008 4 2008 80 joining back we get the output the op that we have to join as it our function is so we can just recalculate the year and offset month from lets take care of adding the create or replace view as from b where as v from now we get the formatted per the 12 1 as am 1 12 as 12 1 as 1 12 as v by eid sm sy em ey v 100 1 2008 2 2008 80 100 3 2008 3 2008 90 100 4 2008 4 2008 80 200 1 2008 2 2008 80 200 3 2008 3 2008 90 200 4 2008 4 2008 80 the data the op all in sql that should run on any and is decomposed into easy to understand and easy to test is better to rejoin or to leave that a trick to the your rdbms allow group bys in have to join first and then or group and then pull in the month and year with correlated this is left as an exercise for the leffler asks in the happens with your query if are gaps in the data entry for with value another for but not one the question clear should happen exactly the op perhaps an that there are no in the absence of a we try to code around something that might not be the fact gaps make the strategy the strategy fail under those say but that would reveal the trick in the trick question i alluded to

 going to say kind of sounds like a big m but so be of the things i got out of reading is kind of a meta is that there is no way of doing only for once you are versed in the practice of refactoring designs into you start worrying less about the shortcomings of the current code because you know you can fix it in the terms of all the stuff that goes on outside of as it i think you just have to get over it do what you need to do to get the code out the a little less but you can refactor the process as well once you learn what works for not saying that your learning about all this stuff should but that you need to be able to get things done in order for any of it to

 got a little lost with your but if you are looking for a way to do database you can do it couple of your mvc can use zend framework that comes with database access you can use keep in mind that you should design your system well to ensure there is no contention in the database as your queries are all scattered across the php pages and may lock tables resulting in the overall web application deteriorating in performance and becoming slower over is why sometimes it is prefereable to use stored procedures as it is in one place and can be tuned when we need though other may argue that it is easier to debug if query statements are on the

 got a situation with a large internal corporate web based application running on iis6 generating 401 responses followed by 200 responses profiled by aware of why this happening auth forcing the browser to resend but looking for some thoughts on how to minimise or eradicate the the application in question is running in the wan with some users experiencing latency of up to 250ms so forcing a subsequent request can have a noticeable impact on page load particularly when there are a number of cascading drop down lists on the pages users of the application are internal within a managed desktop environment so mechanisms to force the browser to send credentials on the first request this even could be possible from a deployment this would work for pages requiring the identity but for resources not requiring authentication and some custom web allowing anonymous auth would be looked at defining this on a per location basis in the but the results were mixed a number of 401 appreciate any guidance on a for dealing with this there are a lot of resources out there identifying the problem but none that found providing a feasible resources not requiring authentication web services used for cascading drop down can be requested anonymously through adding a location entry to the web config but yet to find an answer for authenticated 401 responses followed by 200

 got quite a long business process which eventually results into financial matters in the end is quite exclusively these final although got to keep a log of everything which led to all the information contained into the final operations is available in other tables during the business it makes sense to use a but the view logic would be quite complicated are dozens of tables and concerned that with appropriate a table will probably be way faster table will eventually contain millions if and should be fully searchable on almost all its view logic would be so afraid it may complicate things in a few years if i want to evolve my business of those two a bit tempted to write the data in a table at the end of my business process instead of relying on a but duplicating the data smells right it also looks a bit like premature but since such a central point in my like to address the issue you ever faced such a what did you creating a table would clearly lead to duplication in my the data written in the table exists somewhere else in the database and could be retrieved using only joins without any the tradeoff between normalization and

 got subversion with tortoisesvn and setup here for our first mvc so far been working out pretty well so i would recommend to mention they are both free which is of significance depending on your i tried any vs integration because we have some stuff that we use vs for so i just keep it relegated to the file we even really fully configured cruise control but my favorite part is that once i know something is working i can commit it and once i get the notification email that it built successfully i instantly know improved the since switched over to using it has more of a graphical interface and allows you to skip the whole xml file configuration a couple of things to note is based on java but in my experience all that difficult to set up if you take your time and follow the it still works fine for will need to add a hook to svn the equivalent for your source control to have it wget the build you can have it poll svn automatically every few it varies between projects for i have a few set up each use robocopy to move the files by running a batch script after the when files are copied over robocopy produces a different exit code than when it copies no which causes hudson to think there was an i worked around this by simply duplicating each robocopy command i

 guess is that this is due to the update message being handled on the wrong each thread has its own message messages posted into the message queue will land in the same thread as the caller by the callback will maybe post a message on the wrong move the method to the form and use by to add the item in the correct this may get rid of the to reflect your ui have to know about your what you need is just a proper synchronization between adding the item to your list and the since ui updates will oly work if the thread you might want to supply the control to your class which wraps the and then do the invoke on the list this makes the list worry about triggering the upate on the ui thread and does take the worry from both the ui and the external component of invoking the handler on the correct class listboxdatabindingsource private readonly control private readonly list new public if throw new public void item item new if else private list get return

 guessing the original poster is coming from a background which is causing some in is a doubly linked java is an interface abstract class in can be a doubly linked list is 99 times out of 100 when you want a you want to use which is the rough equivalent of there are other standard such as those returns by and a performance stand point there is a very small hit from having to go through an interface and an extra however runtime inlining means this rarely has an also remember that are an object plus so for each you probably have two other in although copying by value without a pointer as the character arrays will form an object for string these will not usually be this particular code is really performance you could create a single array even for all the characters of all the and then an array of this is how javac is hawtin

 gwt event you are using and you wanted a click event you could use the and register your own the object will need to implement the callback which would give you the row events handling you need to handle other type of events other than click gwt currently have a ready interface for you pretty much left on your own to implement them two ways of doing it that i can think of quick and dirty is probably by exploiting which provides a means for you to inject javascript into your gwt i use much jsni from really hard workarounds which is not worth the effort writing it in pure in my code so i show you an but frankly i recommend this as it reduces maintainability and you wanted a gwt you can create a new class that inherits htmltable or at the call the function with your needed for probably need then need the onbrowserevent function that handles the quick template of how the code should look class extends public public void case mouse over handling code best of learning how to code this is by looking at the gwt source code itself for and getting the feel on how to do it the gwt

 hard to give a good answer without a little more kind of performance do you linear is fine then i would just use a list of dates and iterate through the list collecting all dates that fall within the as you have duplicates in the you need to have repeated dates in your collection then most implementations of a binary tree would probably be something like treeset are set implementations and allow repeated are the access lots of lookups with few or fairly datastructures have between lookups and if doing lots of updates then some datastructure that are optimized for lookups be so what are the access characteristics of the data what kind of performance do you and what are structural characteristics that it must support must allow repeated

 hardware requirements will somewhat depend on what kind of reliability you want for this if using this to run recommend having at least two machines you split the vms and if using n servers you should be able to get by on of them for the time it takes your vendor to replace the bad the 2 if you want higher reliability less then a san of some kind to store the data on is going to be required the live migration stuff seen is if you can live with the method down both move drives from server1 to power up reconfigure vms to use less memory and start then you really need the san the end of the your biggest sizing will be hd and your hd footprint will be relatively fixed least in most kinds of a and your ram footprint should be relatively fixed as well extra here is always cpu is usually one thing you can skimp on a little bit if you have so long as willing to wait for builds and the other nice thing about going all virtualized is that you can start with a pair of big servers and grow out as your needs need to give your dev environment more get another server and split the vms need to simulate a lower the memory usage of the existing node and spin up 3 this unless i needed very performance i need to consider clustering physical servers for performance go with a virtualized with the extensions on modern cpus and support for the hit is not that big if done

 has the right answer about checking the totalmemory could probably use a paging although more and more data is loaded from the server i think all the data is used at all you could get data from the server and gradually save on the computer in a watch out for silesize limitations and you would keep track of what data is available say data from index 0 to if the user wants to see data between 200 and 300 you get stored if it aleady stored of if not request the data and inform the user that data is on are a few handy link related totalmemory and the garbage what i think is more suited since there a lot data from the might be is the safe limit of flash memory on web scenario and how well is as bit

 have a complicated background image with a lot of small regions that need rollover illustration along with additional text display and associated links for each the final illustration stacks several static images with transparency using and the highlight rollover illustrations need to display in one of the layers to achieve the desired some unsuccessful fiddling with i decided this might be done with an image i made a schematic test map with four geometric shape outlines and them using with png the idea is to associate the image map with the bottom background initialize all the rollovers with css and use hover method to make them visible as well as reveal associated text in a separate the separate text function is why not trying to this with the pseudoclass instead of jquery because i was using the image i made all the rollover pngs have transparent sized to the full container for exact placement so everything lines up i got not the image map is correctly mapped to activate only the geometric but the href from each rollover area works only and using jquery hover with css visibility is messed desired behavior is that rolling into the area simply would make the shape what actually happens is any motion inside the shape makes rapid toggling between visible and when the cursor stops within the it might be visible or it might any ideas hover setup ultimately use arrays for real associated links and border jquery hover with html image

 have a form that will be populated by a bunch of information from a and then handed over to the user to fill out the the thing the template and the object that holds the eventual result are because all going into and out of a database i have no schema control so this seems like a great place to just bind all the controls and get on with more important get the controls to bind and this is partly my fault because i wanted to just throw it a have it work out which columns from the row are and keep the values from so frequently throwing it rows that have all the columns the controls and so they throw an but partly fault because doing templatebinder is a bindingsource object with the datasource property set to the datarow i want to trickle throws an exception when i go to show the not really sure what i should do differently the templatebinder contain any datasource until i get the template and if i have to manage the bindings myself instead of setting them and forgetting them at the top of the page not getting much value out of this is just a test to see if what trying to do is even trying to pass the bindingsource a row that contains the values i want to propagate to the suspend switch it out for a blank row from the table so the values i propagated out stay in the properties show the let the user fill it out and then turn on binding again so the bound properties in the controls trickle into the blank row set as the bindingsource i no way because be too but sure be nice if i could do that instead of my old way which involved a switch want to go too far down the rabbit hole a tempting button in visual studio that says just set everything all up but i have experience with visual studio that suggests it like the idea that the schema of the database be changed through visual in i have no idea how to get the flexibility i my demand from this fancy automagic setup even see how to programmatically mess with the connection the code i have is probably less of a sin than killing features because i made a sweeping change behind the scenes that happens to make certain very handy features copypasta can be turned into a function a lot quicker than it takes to rewrite the entire and then what if the database automagic code seems to prefer to throw an exception instead of just swallowing its pride and not doing anything if it have enough information to do stack the i want to make data binding work for me instead of making me throw out everything can binding is more complicated than

 have a in my application that is used for editing arbitrary i need to be able to run an arbitrary subroutine on another thread that also looks at these objects if the obvious issue is that a user could be editing one of these objects at the same time my search thread is reading which would be preferable to avoid it probably result in anything critical since my search thread is just not is easy enough from my search but after looking through the documentation and a brief skim through the propertydescriptorgridentry code in i cannot seem to find an analogous spot to use a call on the object in question on the i was hoping there would be beginedit and endedit events which would make this simple but i seem to find any such rather not lock the entire object while on display in the propertygrid as that would obviously block my search thread until another object was a bit new to the threading model of windows so hoping some obvious answer just any synchronously cloning my objects before running the search asynchronously will likely be inefficient enough that i might as well run the search itself synchronously the point of running asynchronously is of course to allow my users to continue to work while the search is the search needs to scale as the data set i am going through will eventually end up being arbitrarily which makes synchronous cloning look like it will cause the usability problem i am trying to propertygrid

 have a pretty good experience with both mysql and i found postgresql to be more faster and better but i recommend it you have to know what looking for in a db to be able to i had experience in putting postgresql to be a good replacement for sql server in environments where we migrated everything from sql server to and did much better with the same hardware from windows to linux as also gives you way more options to optimize your and tune your database in general as long as know what you can mess around as you wish in its configuration one thing that kills me in mysql is the damn it kills a file that can be and nowhere to be you can even have a file in your home dir and depending on your configuration and how you invoke your it can wildly interfere with the works of the had serious troubles with servers with randomly placed giving me big headaches to find in the world was mysql getting its much better to have just one or two as postgresql also found postgresql to be a decent replacement for oracle in certain where oracle really necessary to begin but somehow somebody got convinced business person flooded with the nonsense sales arguments probably was the person who made the and bought it was totally and we could replace it without any major problems by it was a while version of but yet it made a good job in replacing it was a fairly big database and postgresql was up to the postgresql supports some nice features like stored procedures can be in or whatever languages postgresql supports also have some experience with and have worked with it since its version so for a mysql is generally very good if you mind about the inner workings of the or if you need a competent database to do something cool and it can be really really and you can really get in trouble and get cornered in the future if you think about what one thing that i hate the most is the ability to choose your storage while it sounds great in i can all it is in reality not very the main flaw with it is no matter which engine you always gain and lose stuff in for if you want referential integrity foreign keys and you use and humble along with the poorer not necessarily just worse performance of innodb also features lots of silly size and quantity of you have tables with more than 1000 columns in it literally kills mysql when we talk about data gives me the feeling that mysql is a sewed thing between many different other products used to be a company in the db you just have to download the source code of both to see the while the source code of postgresql is more source code is source tree is not as organized as and oh that makes a huge difference when you another fact that supports my argument about the source code is the build postgresql build is much faster than sometimes i think that rebuild my kernel is faster than rebuilding killer thing for if in the business of selling as in a software house or software provider or something like is their crappy licensing i but they have an enterprisey license mode as and if you want to package mysql for distribution with your you just do it without paying them royalties fees and on the other is licensed under so you can do just whatever you want with it even improve it and sell a also another aspect that like to mysql is actively maintained by mysql a privately held and postgresql is totally supported by the opensource no strings attached to any the query oh let me start on the query mysql query planner just not for from but if you go deeper and starts to put queries with and the planner just gives up on you and starts to read each row in the bringing your application wake you up in the middle of the getting directly to the mysql is great if you want have a kind of reliable to use in simple mysql easy synchronization come in handy when we need to build a high availability and is also great for load use any kind of lamp you name just and works and is easy to at cheap hosting company is better if need to have a more reliable solution to supply your business something that can to and replace sql server and is supports advanced database like stored procedures in many different different transaction isolation synchronization is not as trivial as in but it just works other resources that may be

 have a product that has both a winforms and a web and are providing the users a way to launch into another company asset web we need to make sure that the user only ever has one instance of the other web application open in a browser at least that opened for we accomplished this by doing the the winforms we have a hidden webbrowser control when the user clicks the button to launch the other we write a small html page into the documenttext property that our web client when the user clicks on the same button we do something only one client or the other this works surprisingly where things get sticky and weird is when you try accessing it from both if you launch the other product from the winforms app it launches a new and any subsequent launches of the product from either client load in the instance already but if you do it the other way and start from the web the first instance launches in a new tab in the same then every launch from the winforms client goes to a new using the same value for the parameter of the in both bizarre to see it work so horribly can anyone explain how the parameter is scoped in this is webbrowser control hosts and our product is when launching from the winforms client first it seems to be global to all open but the other way around makes it seem very much the is the scope of in

 have an existing perl application which is deployed to multiple customer the code has been cloned multiple times to customise it for individual so there are now several complete copies of the code which all have slight task is to fix this mess by creating a generic code base with customisations for different customers being isolated in their own application already has a class hierarchy about 120 along the lines goal is to be able to customise a specific class or method by modifying only the library for a particular first instinct is to create for anything that needs to be customised for a particular these would live in a lib directory per to customise a class or method for a i would just add a new to the customer if one method in needs to be i might create a subclass which inherits from and contains only the method to be in the main problem is that this will break the code for all other customers because they have the class in their it appears i would have to add an empty class to the library for every there a better other possibility considered is to use overrides instead of the main program would just need a to include the customer library and any methods to be customised would just be in the however this is probably dangerous and not considered best seek the wisdom of stackoverflow gurus in finding the best approach to this is the best way to customise parts of an existing perl program for multiple

 have three points that form a i simply need to calculate what the vertex of the parabola is that goes through these three preferably a quick way as i have to do a lot of these a website provides general form of a parabola is given by the a b x c y where and c are arbitrary real you have three pairs of points that are ordered substitute the x and y values of each point into the equation for a you will get three linear equations in three the three you can then easily solve this system of three equations for the values of and and have the equation of the parabola that intersects your 3 the vertex is where the first derivative is a little algebra c for the would be nice to see actual code that does this calculation in or to calculate the vertex of a parabola given three

 have to understand three related windows stations and but because a relationships between sessions and we can broadly ignore stations for this a session contains a station being the only interactive and stations contain one or more session architecture differs according to windows for nt 5 and everything before services execute in session 0 along with the interactive this is why you can configure services to interact with the desktop in these windows nt versions they are in the same for nt 6 server 2008 going services exists in session 0 but the interactive desktop is in another this is known as and is basically a security since session 0 apps cannot get at the interactive it makes no sense for them to attempt to display a user interface of any to make this more vista has a temporary kludge to cater for this if an app in session 0 tries to create a windows will trap this and present a warning to the user so they switch to a presume desktop where they can interact with the however this measure is explicitly temporary and you cannot rely upon it being in future windows seen this working in native but i suspect you are in managed code and the runtime is being smart enough to catch your behaviour and deliver a metaphorical slap to the hindquarters

 have worked on several rails applications that experienced high load due to viral growth on mongrel count should be based on several if your mongrels make api calls or deliver email and must wait for then you should run as many as try to maintain one mongrel per cpu with maybe a couple extra left sure your server is using a fair proxy balancer round here is the nginx module that does here are some other tips on improving and benchmarking your application performance to handle the most common problem rails applications face is poor usage of activerecord it can be quite easy to make of queries when only one is the easiest way to determine if this could be a problem with your application is to set up after making a request to each major page on your take a look at the newrelic sql if you see a large number of very similar queries sequentially from posts where id select from posts where id select from this may be a sign that you need to use a in one of your activerecord other basic activerecord tips are just the ones i can think of off the top of my not doing it make sure to correctly use indexes on your database making database calls in especially it can be very easy to lose track of how much you are making database queries in push all queries and calculations into your models or making queries in usually this can be done by using an having rails build activerecord objects for large datasets as much as when you make a call like a new class is instantiated for every post in your database it could be a large query in this case you would want to use which will make a single fast query and return an integer without instantiating any like create both a and the latter skips instantiation of activerecord objects and can be much especially when dealing with large numbers of objects this is a good way to speed things and use whenever it will help you keep your code tiny and makes it much easier to have efficient apis much as you do not make api calls to external services while handling a your server will stop executing code until a response is not only will this add to load but your mongrel will not be able to handle new you absolutely must make external calls during a you will need to run as many mongrels as possible since you may run into a situation where many of them are waiting for an api response and not doing anything is a very common problem when building facebook same applies to sending emails in some if you expect many users to sign up in a short period of be sure to benchmark the time it takes for actionmailer to deliver a if not almost instantaneous then you should consider storing emails in your database an using a separate script to deliver like have been created to solve this a good guide on the different methods of caching in performance you suspect a method may be try benchmarking it in an track of methods that are slow in your those are the ones you want to avoid executing in some cases only the first call will be slow since rails has a query you can also cache the method yourself using will also provide a nice overview of how long methods and sql calls take to

 hbase documentation makes it clear that you should group similar columns into column because the physical storage is done by column what does it mean to put two column families into the same as opposed to having separate tables per column are there specific cases when tables this way makes more and cases when one table works tables should result in separate which could be beneficial when some column families a are very when would it be advantageous to have columns families bunched spreading column families across tables or

 hits page which then spawns a rendering pages all using to worry about the fact that is seemingly sending the user 7 responses for 1 that part is handled and only one response gets problem in a enviroment production with many threads we get an string boolean datetime string boolean string duplicate it my coworker believes this is because reusing the original httpcontext and passing it into the other and that not this tried making a new httpcontext to pass into the but parts of it seemingly i need to get the session object into the new i imagine want to get other parts in as like for the record is questions you think the error is from using httpcontext across can i fix the fix is duplicating the httpcontext for each how can i get the session into the new request and response come in the but session is not more going back to this worry about the fact that is seemingly sending the user 7 responses for 1 that part is handled and only one response gets huge fan of raymond i agree with you have two is a reasonable statement in the absence of any more actually happening is that building an excel document to send in the page setting up some state including the fact that rendering to and the object to do the rendering each spawned page gets that and will block until their turn to render to the if literally looks like protected override void if all the processing up to that point database control all done in and a lot of it enough that parrallizing it while still letting it block on render will cut the overall time in over the best part of it is nothing had to be rewritten for the excel all the controls know how to render themselves to and you can visit each spawned page independently the actually the excel report is just an aggregation of all the spawned i figured the end result was going to be do you need to rethink the but i had to at least because the fact that everything works so nicely without duplicating any logic or any code or having to abstract anything is just so and only the if i render the pages serially everything is just an httpcontext across	
 honestly sounds like you have never seen someone use vi who is truly proficient in when you normally use visual studio you frequently will move your hand over to your click through viemu your hand never leaves the you are switching highlighting groups of fixing performing complex motions on your code and running regular expression searches in for people who are fast typists it allows you to achieve a speed for tasks you would not be able to people will counter this by saying things of my development time is spent the extra speed i gain from using tools like these is is a in my it is for most large programming tasks you spend far more time planning and thinking then you do actually slinging but that mean that being able to express yourself through your ide 2x faster have an impact on your productivity as a

 hope i framed the question i am trying to force myself to be a better by better i mean i want to write a program to identify the files in a directory and read each file for further after some shuffling i got to file in for line in should be no surprise that i get an attributeerror since y is a i think about that when i wrote the am thinking about this and am afraid that i have five open files are five files in the directory specified by can fix the code so it runs and i explicitly close the files after opening i am curious if i need to or if python handles closing the file in the next iteration of the if so then i only need to file in for line in am guessing that does handle this the reason i think that this might be handled is that i have changed the that y is when i start the second iteration there are no more memory references to the file that was opened and read using the readlines to know when to manage resources in

 how to update modelstate in got a simple user submits i want to validate input and in some circumstances i want to fix the error for letting him know that he made an error that is already actionresult if be return return the problem mvc will simply ignore the model passed to the view and will whatever the user typed and not my value because the textbox renderer checkes if there is a modelstate and if not null value is that value is of course the one user typed before i change the behaviour of textbox renderer the only solution i found would be to update the modelstate by the way is to the defaultmodelbinder and override the method that assigns the values from forms to model by simply changing the assignment direction using defaultmodelbinder i have to parse the following code on original implementation of is my solution to updates modelstate using values from used by argument name in action not explicitly protected void string new new model modelname modelstate modeltype valueprovider private class reversedbinder protected override void modelbindingcontext string prefix object val new prefix bool res if imodelbinder binder new object obj2 modelbindingcontext context2 new modelbindingcontext context object obj3 if var prefixkey x new the question am i doing something extremely uncommon or am i missing if the then how could i implement such functionality in a better way existing mvc modelstate with model

 i agree that this is bad in you could use the new closure syntax with the magic word to use operators as functions if we want to supply a way of doing this you i can think of using mixed with the you use a regex pattern to get convert the functions into compatible and put themin a private than you use the method to fetch working on a small here is the i got the inspiration from a class i saw a few weeks ago that used closures to implement supplies an interface with which you can load external functions into an existing the functions supplied to this class will recive the classes referance as a first and as a second argument they will recive an array of supplied arieh glazer mit like array holder of genarated protected loads functions for an external file into the a the file must not contain php string a public function for public function if else throw new such method the source cannot have any php functions will always be we can only mimic what i did was to pass as a 1st argument and the second is the array of arguments is a 4th you will not be able to access members and methods from within the example for a source the object has a member called echo was a fun exercise for but a bad practice all in all

 i consider the level of advancement pretty much the opposite of your therefore this response might not be directly but i hope at least somewhat any environment that encourages is if i see a lot of a lot of template and especially any use of a big red warning it means the developers have some idea of what correct programming but are constrained by either lack of imagination or politics to using a decrepit junk language such as c is boring and tedious to work but goes out of its way to interfere with check whether a particular technology or concept is treated as a if the prospective employer uses an easy check you can do do they use a real sax or dom is or do they parse it with regexes and serialize it with raw character if the it shows they understand xml is and just using it to have another acronym on the project figure out what language the developers they were using and every good developer has a favorite obscure language it matter whether or factor and a reason for preferring if everybody is content to work in another warning sign that not got much curiosity about programming in

 i get data in postgresql is and i know i can use to make my queries i know there might even be a type in a future version of my question how do you deal with this when designing user thinking specifically of uniqueness say my data looks more or less like a file system google except that google docs actually allows duplicate names how can i make it easy for our users to understand the fact that they can have duplicate if the case is i think to most it will just seem get some questions out of the come from a windows so is how i i now primarily use mac os which you is the majority of our users fit into these same two new to most of my experience is with but also used which is like i thought a lot of about this issue but ultimately left everything and let our users just figure it interested in both technical solutions making this problem just go and ui design solutions helping the user feel comfortable with the do you deal with case insensitivity when designing user can i make it easy for our users to understand the fact that they can have duplicate if the case is i appreciate all the feedback so if the answer is allow duplicate names if they differ by then do i implement in one solution considered is silently maintaining a separate column which is always the version of the and putting the unique constraint on this do you expose case sensitivity to

 i had to agree with your will personally prefer composition to inheritance in about of the but it all depends a little on which programming language in a rich language like practically not be using inheritance at all henceforth also quite few protected a more primitive language like there are so few sensible options to that you basically have to use any means available to so inheritance is overused in java to create working for microsoft or sun and are making the api for or the windows template method be for the rest of the template method pattern borders on being an in my lot of times it uses up your inheritance hierarchy for wrong between subclasses and base classes tend to become classes have a tendency to become littered with all sorts of unrelated forces you to lock down often quite early in the development lock down in a lot of this at a later stage becomes just harder and while by no means being i tend to have very few protected methods in my is the smell of

 i have an database that i want to use to update through a one of the columns in this table has an xml other column in that table of an xml updates perfectly but when i went to make changes to the xml the program executes but the field always retains its original value after i run looked around the internet and found a few posts on microsoft connect diagnosing similar problems and finally stumbled on the solution force xml field update this tmp of that to force linq to update xml column assign a cloned new xelement can confirm that this does indeed seem to but not exactly sure my only guess is that the xmlfield property has some sort of unique identifier on the heap and that by making a assigned it a new unique when linq then generates the it even attempt to see if the field has been since it has a new it simply write the value to the simply speculating and hope that someone else can provide a better understanding of what is going on behind the to address the reason for the issue it is explained on the ms connect is that xml field does not update because handle the my the code that works ends up looking something like new reference anyone else that finds this the following also new with xml database fields why does this

 i have been playing a game on my iphone called some of you may know this game as when the game starts you get a matrix of letters like x i m l w b s t goal of the game is to find as many words as you can that can be formed by chaining letters you can start with any and all the letters that surround it are fair and then once you move on to the next all the letters that surround that letter are fair for any previously used so in the grid for i could come up with the words words must be at least 3 and no more than nxn which would be 16 in this game but can vary in some while this game is fun and i am apparently not very good at it and i wanted to cheat a little bit by making a program that would give me the best possible words longer the word the more points you not very good with algorithms or their efficiencies and so my first attempt uses a dictionary as this and does a linear search trying to match combinations with dictionary this takes a long time to find the possible and since you only get 2 minutes per it is simply not am interested to see if any stackoverflowers can come up with more efficient i am mostly looking for solutions using the big 3 and although anything with java or is cool since speed is php am adding a bounty to this question as my way of saying thanks to all the people who pitched in with their unfortunately i can only give the accepted answer to one of so measure who has the fastest boggle solver 7 days from now and award the winner the thanks to everyone that to find list of possible words from a letter matrix

 i have no experience developing applications on the 360 or the i have done a lot of research into the various merits of the two i have used for a long time and even though built several mfc and beos applications with build a number of unix server applications with and still the console game environment is significantly cell chip is really quite a beast to as others have said and takes a of talent to properly that being nothing wrong with attending a course if especially if you get to meet people that have developed games before and could give you some you want to develop games for a the best bet for someone with only a rudimentary knowledge of is to use the xna kit for the xbox if familiar with the way that hard to pick in argue a much smaller learning curve than to make the jump to if never developed applications you should steer clear of that sort of thing until two months is not enough are a number of points that make the xna platform very compelling for aspiring console not the least of which is the relative safety of and the fact that xna games can be sold through the microsoft know of many ps3 games that have been developed but there are a few examples on the 360 such as braid that are pretty much solo the xna examples are also quite interesting and

 i have this word document that has a whole bunch of tables some of which are pretty it spans many many pages in some i need to programmatically convert this thing to was initially told we could just copy paste into excel and save it as a then i could convert from there which would be pretty due to the formatting of some of the fields there would need to be a lot of extra manipulation on the spreadsheet after copying to excel to get it to look right and to have the csv come out should note that this is an for an old app written in frowny debating just writing a separate command line tool in if make it seems like has some word interop stuff that i doubt was in the but i investigated that too just looking for the way this can be it matter so much how achieved as long as it is achieved and done some of the steps could be done manually if they too like if getting it to some other format first would save a bunch of coding and too difficult that would be anyone done anything like this any so here is an example of exactly what need to have a word doc that looks something like birds name data type required length total digits fraction digits text yes 16 unique observation primary the table with name and vendor and birds in this as an example it just has one valid can have multiple things separated by commas where each thing would be enclosed by value tags inside the what i basically need to do is get that to convert to this observation primary will always be a base table and a stage table where base table is the same name as whatever follows the colon at the beginning of the so it would be and the stage table is always then what follows the also notice the version and the last modified and version date in the these things can be worried about later and perhaps manually is the best way to programatically convert a word document with a table structure to

 i know but i still am pretty much a rest and form helpers are completely different i understand state transfer is only loosely related to the actual rendering of forms and really has to do with and to a certain extend the idea is that instead of trying to think about an entire conversation with a you write a webapp to respond in predictable ways to individual client if a client gets a you just retrieve format it for send it to and forget about a client posts an update of some you change the webapps state to reflect send back any and then forget about any future get or post will look at the new but not the message that created whether or not an application is restful depends not really on how complicated the model but on how users interact with an app meant to be at least somewhat that is is a good candidate for something that relies heavily on and interacting with a specific and is might not be such a good the other you have rails form these are great for but sometimes can be frustrating when you try to use them in more complicated what is your main do you have a specific question about rails form about rails or something specific to

 i think the answer is going to be the development expertise and the project needs that will decide web forms is so heavily used that it likely going away anytime there are so many custom controls and support such as components and the main benefit of web forms is how easy it is to get a dynamic website up and it really is a rad way of developing once that team has more experience with creating larger websites with much higher demands in terms of and then they will look towards other solutions for in this they will realize that web forms are harder for they may also see that viewstates reduce performance and look for possible mvc has the stated it is unlikely that anyone will convert their sites to use this new framework right away or it requires the team to learn the new and work out the new the team will have to learn new ways to do the exact same for how easy is it to support uploading a file using i saw there a reason you create a site using mvc and web forms so you may see more hybrids in the near but i doubt that web forms will ever go kind of think about web forms like the way vb1 changed the way windows applications are created on the to this the rad way of creating application still exists and will never go	
 i think the cast where runtime type is should allowed if d is a c and the difference to c are added this should be should it at if you could make this then you could compile code that attempted to call one of the on this which would fail at runtime since that method does not exist in think you are imagining that the cast would detect the methods that are from c and delegate them to d i doubt that would be although i speak to the language design seems to me the solution to your problem class which extends c and implements a constructor which essentially clones the state of the given c object into a new d d object can be passed to your existing code because it is a and it can be passed to code that wants an i because it is an

 i think your second assumption may be is the right way to check for of two not overload resolution for operators is at compile not run the compiler can definitively know the types of the objects applying an operator it since the compiler cannot be sure that an is going to be something that has an override for it falls back to the default implementation of see this more try defining an for and adding two unless you explicitly cast to it will fail to because the compiler tell that a particular is an and there is no default implementation to fall back to in of your frustration probably stems from the fact that implements an and everything is an so the compiler can successfully resolve operations like for all when you overrode you expected to see the same behavior but and because the best match the compiler can find is the original all comparisons to use equals rather than is not a viable especially when passing your types to libraries as my this is precisely what you should be is the right way to check for of two sometimes semantic equality is just reference in which case you need to change in other as in your override when you need a stronger equality contract than reference for you may want to consider two equal if they have the same social security or two equal if they have the same and are not the same whenever you need to override you should override but almost never the other way is more of a syntactical some clr languages visual even permit you to override the equality

 i understand i think you perhaps are misunderstanding how the module you are already specifying an address of for the server to bind you start the server via your call to this is going to cause the server to start listening to a socket on to the that socket is passed to your requesthandler as the when data is received on the your method should be able to that object using the documented socket you want a further it looks like your requesthandler can extend from streamrequesthandler and to the socket using objects point there is no need for you to create an additional socket and then try to force your server to use the new one part of the value of the socketserver module is that it manages the lifecycle of the socket for the flip if you want to test your server from a then you would want to create a socket that you can your client requests but you would never pass this socket to your per you would probably do this in a completely separate process and test your server via ipc over the based on new get server a to open a socket to server b when server a receives data one solution is to simply open a socket from inside your that there are likely some other design concerns that you will need to address based on the requirements of your you may want to use a simple connection pool that say opens a few sockets to server b that server a can use like a there may already be some libraries in python that help with your current your requesthandler has access to the server as a member variable so you could do something like def point socketb hold serverb def data if print do whatever with the like i it may be better for you to have some sort of connection pool or other object that manages your server b socket such that your server a handler can just the socket as incoming requests are way you can better deal with conditions where server b breaks the your current design be able to handle broken sockets very just some	
 i understand the problem of finding the longest simple path in a graph is since you could then easily solve the hamiltonian circuit problem by setting edge weights to 1 and seeing if the length of the longest simple path equals the number of question what kind of path would you get if you took a found the maximum edge replaced each edge weight with and ran a standard shortest path algorithm on clearly not the longest simple since if it then np and i think the proof for something like that would be a bit more complicated simple

 i understand the question mark wants to see an overview of all the last results for each means for every result he only wants to see only one and that is the result which has last been added for that think the easiest way to achieve would be to create an additional which we can call for class public int resultid public int resulttypeid public datetime resultdate class should not be but nhibernate should be aware that this class have to import we can create an icriteria which will populate instances of myresultoverview which will also generate the most efficient sql query in order to get this should look something like criteria results should give you a list of myresultoverview instances which represent the myresults that looking in order to retrieve the myresult you can simply do this by retrieving the myresult instance for that particalur resultid that retrieved as tested nor did i compile but this is the path that i would follow to achieve	
 i understand the question you want the data to load after the page is in the if this is the then you can fire an event with javascript when the page loads on the method used is to put a hidden not any button on the page and it with the event of the button click event will need to be wired in the also the button would have to be in an update panel that either contains the grids you want to be bound or has the appropriate triggers to cause them to might look at jquery to get manage when this code gets the your code method will fire after the entire dom is which is faster than waiting on the entire page to load and so

 i want to state that silverlight 2 does not support element to element that feature is added in silverlight 3 in beta having said i think you want to bind controls together it sounds like trying to build a numericupdown control and you probably have some class in code behind actually doing the incrementing and the you can simply subscribe to the click handlers and call a method on your model like increment or your model can expose a property for the current value and that property is what is bound to your text if actually trying to build a numericupdown you might want to check out the silverlight the toolkit already includes this control and it also supports data out the numericupdown control and download the toolkit binding from a child control to a parent control really any the parent usercontrol has a datacontext and all child controls inherit each individual child control can also have its datacontext binding expressions are always relative to the datacontext and the datacontext can be set in in your probably to a model of some hope that bienz

 if a unit is used anywhere in the it matter how many more times it matter how many places you remove a unit from if still used at least once the compiled program will behave the and it will have roughly the same only difference would be in the order of unit initialization and finalization order affects the order those sections are executed although the precise effect has never been documented try not to rely on initialization i still encourage you to clean up your unit for the same reason encouraged to clean up your variable lists and your parameter when you get rid of the stuff you it makes it easier to read the code kept because you can be reasonably confident that what reading gives an accurate picture of what the code if your code mentions a bunch of units but never really makes use of then the next time you or someone else looks at the a good change going to spend some time trying to find where your code uses the facilities of those say to this code includes but i see where it draws better take another because i think this code had any responsibilities like can you take some time out of your day to tell me where this unit draws

 if this is obvious or covered but been googling all day and found a solution that actually problem is as i am currently drawing an image in a full screen for examples sake say the image is in the bottom right corner of the like to do a rotation at the center of that by default the rotation command rotates around the center of the uiview it as a my image moves around the screen when i rotate instead of it staying in place and rotating around its own what i need to translate my context so that the of the is at the center of my and then restore the context by translating back to the original following is the closest thing gotten to but the problem is that while the image is it moves downward while i think this is caused by animation tweening the 1st step translate and 3rd step translate instead of just realizing that the beginning and end point on the translates would be the before this make a call to a function that draws a path to a passed in inversetranslation transy translation rot final rot translation then i apply the transformation animation like normal using final etc also tried stuff like cgcontexttranslatectm and but these seem to have little been fighting with this for days and my current solution seems but i have no clue how to get rid of that translating does anyone have a solution for this or a better way to go about the time being drawing my image centered at the center and then setting the property to the origin like to rotate and then doing the rotate seems like a bit of a but until i can get the real translates working my only i move the origin when doing a rotation transform in quartz 2d for the

 ignore subversion strategies and strategies stemming from that there is a difference between saving a change and publishing a is saving a while i suggest committing on a i would suggest you think of it more like saving a file than releasing a do it when you fear you may need to come but are afraid it would otherwise be hard to get back to where you rewrite the commits rebase for before you publish find the meaning in the mess you made and create a set of comprehensible and clean commits with good commit messages and ensure each passes whatever quality checks you might then publish

 implemented a couple of systems that mimiced what olap cubes and here are a couple of things we did to get them to the core data was held in a n dimensional all in and all the keys were implemented via hierarchies of pointers to the underlying in this way we could have multiple different sets of keys for the same the data in the array was the equivalent of the fact often it would only have a couple of pieces of in one instance this was price and number the underlying array was often so once it was created we used to remove all the blank cells to save memory lots of hard core pointer arithmetic but it as we had heirarchies of we could write routines quite easily to drill a hierarchy for instance we would access year of by going through the months which in turn mapped to days at each level we would aggregate data as part of building the cube made calculations much we implement any kind of query but we did support drill down on all axis 7 in our biggest and that was tied directly to the ui which the users we implemented core stuff in but these days i reckon could be fast but worry about how to implement sparse that sound

 imply a lot of linux file systems delay writes and batch them which improves overall presumably reduces wear on the disk and improves battery life for if the os had to write to disk whenever a file many of these benefits would be tomblin mentioned a controversy in his and explaining the one seen fit into a what recent controversy is over the ext4 ordering is the proposed successor to the popular ext3 linux file it is in linux and unix to change important files by reading the old writing out the new one with a different and renaming the new one to the old the idea is to ensure that either the new one or the old one will be even if the system fails at some ext4 appears to be happy to read the old rename the new one to the old and write the new which can be a real problem if the system goes down between steps 2 and standard way to deal with this is of course but that trashes the real solution is to modify ext4 to keep the ext3 where it rename a file until it had finished writing it apparently this covered by the so a quality of implementation and qoi is really lousy there being no way to reliably write a new version of configuration files without constantly calling with all the problems that or risking losing both

 in only works for the immediate you access a looks someone else beat me to the punch with the answer about it being possible to do in i think the way i did the code gen has some so post it thing i did differently is to use expression which enable you to use the compiler to do overload resolution and generic argument stuff is and you want to have to replicate it your self if you can help your the code would work like del would probably want to store the delegate in a readonly static so that you only have to compile it need to specify 3 generic owner type this is the class that you would have invoked the code from if you were not using base class this is the class you want to make the non virtual call delegate this should represent the signature of the method being called with an extra parameter for the possible to eliminate but it requires more work in the code gen method takes a single a lambda representing the it has to be a and only a if you want to extend the code gen you can support more complex the lambda body is restricted to only being able to access lambda and can only pass them in directly to the you can remove this restriction if you extend the code gen in the method body to support all expression that would take some work you can do anything you want with the delegate that comes so the restriction too big of a important to note that this code is not it could use a lot more and it work with or parameters because of expression tree did test it in sample cases with void methods returning and generic and it you can find some edge cases that any the il gen static tdelegate where tdelegate if throw new must be a delegate var body as if body throw new a call foreach arg in if support non lambda parameter you need to add support for compiling all expression throw new a constant or parameter if null support a non constant you have to implement support for compiling all expression throw new a constant base var parammap new int index foreach item in parametertypes var m new var builder var calltarget if var paramindex foreach item in var param if var obj return obj as

 is basically programmatic access to the virtual memory sub you 1g and you mmap you get a pointer to file as if it were in at this stage nothing has happened save the actual mapping operation of reserving pages for the file in the large the the longer the mapping of order to start reading data from the you simply access it through the pointer you were returned in the mmap you wish to parts of the just visit the area like to make sure you visit all of the pages you want to since the vm will only load the pages you for say within your 1g you have a 10mb area that like to map the simplest way would be to just your or whatever data structure you letting the vm page in data as if you that the of the and that your page size for your vm then you can just cast the mmap pointer to a char and just iterate through the load 10mb of data from int offset offset offset 10 1024 offset 4 char mmapptr deref pointer to force mmap char c for l1 and l2 mmap has nothing to do with all about how you access the using the underlying vm anything that addresses data within the block will work from you change any of the the vm will automatically flush out old pages as new pages are needed if you actually do change then the vm will write those pages back for	
 is because all the messages are being captured by button and messages stop message bubbling the answer is right in your event will bubble up the visual tree from the source element either it has been or it reaches the root tanguay commented on this answer and i am copying his comment here because it is very see that the button is handling the i have no click handler on the i do have a click handler on the stackpanel and hence i would think it would bubble up past the button since the button handle it and get handled by the stackpanel which are button is not handling the mousedown event because no handler ha been specified for it at that mousedown is particular in some at least in windows forms it is used to initiate actions as drawing and dragging when a control gets the it proceeds to trap all the subsequent mouse messages even if you have not defined handlers for this trap is done when the control sets capture property to true and this effectively stop subsequent events from being bubbled capture property is set back to false by windows forms when it gets a mouseup this is the way it works in windows you may want to this imho there is no reason why this should be different for se the section forms at slightly down from the middle of the see my comment to answer for a reference on bubble and tunneling events raise

 is code which includes a variadic function and calls to the variadic i would expect that it would output each sequence of numbers it does when compiled as a but not when compiled as a void argument for i val return is the output when compiled for argument argument argument argument argument note that the reason the variadic function pulls out is because the use of this is for a variadic function that accepts a list of pointers and naturally the length argument should be a and in some cases a caller might pass in a length for for i const ptr const len that the passed into might encounter the problem described and really the caller should be using or the result of or just plain put the number into a but the point is that the compiler is not catching this common danger with variadic right thing to do here is to eliminate the variadic function and replace it with a better mechanism that provides type i would like to document this and collect more detailed information as to exactly why this problem exists on this platform and manifests as it does this variadic function fail on 4th parameter on windows

 is fairly just had a quick read on design from what i can by effectively branching the files individually into an arbitrary going to be heading for a world of pain when you start to merge things back to their original location the merge probably be done in a single commit across all the i think you can do a similar thing to design parts in subversion with a bit of a design part can be simulated using externals allows externals to point to files as well as do you could setup your project heirarchy like parts folder would only contain an property which brings in the appropriate files for that part into the appropriate then checkout the rather than and you get a working copy that contains just the files you want in the structure that the part and when you going straight into trunk no merging required can also baseline your parts by first branching the entirety of trunk and and then changing your part externals to point to the branch instead of the main this increase the size of the and your working copy keeps exactly the same just sourcing all your files from the branch rather than any updates to that part also goes against the branch merging the changes of the part is just a bog standard merge of the branch back into which is standard svn the definition of parts gets more since in the scheme each part is defined manually and not need some form of script that knows the parts hierarchy and given a part can build the appropriate externals definitions which can then be applied to a parts while subversion explicitly provide the abstraction layer of it can be modeled manually fairly accurately only limited by the capabilities of and the scripts which you use to manage

 is how to do this properly using the idea is turn a decently marked up html form into nicer color and size swatch buttons for users that have benefits of this method are you can easily or components and have the form still it will work for users that hvae and if it will be accessible via keyboard and screen it also requires no extra code on and will be a lot easier to use with a form of the work is done with css with only minimal javascript to add the finishing working example example can be found it includes both color and size i have only included the colors here as there is only a slight difference in the css between the markup the form here are the you may obviously want to add like a wrapper around the whole or use other so may seem a lot for but there are several things going on the whole container is flagged as so everything within can be targeted appropriately with css i add a class corresponding to the and a class on each echoing the value to allow css to add appropriate styles the rest is pretty much your standard form javascript is very all we do is detect which radio input is currently selected and flag the container with a thus allowing css to highlight it notify css that js is for every radio redo every function refresh this trigger initial this of triggering click to enforce the initial run may be unsafe if you have click handlers higher i use this method for is where the real magic the idea is that we can tuck the input controls out of view and style the labels as color so long as the attributes on the labels correctly point to on the inputs then clicking the labels will suffice to select the control need to target things only within so that users that have javascript but still have css will see the radio input some sort of class could alternatively be added on the wrapper to get the same thing float the buttons and give them a more attributes are lined up horizontally li border 1px solid margin 0 4px 0 padding float overflow position put and on each li so we can shift the input element out of this will keep it but we just no longer have to look at if remove inputs from sight input position left up is turning the labels into if turn color labels into buttons label cursor display height width hide text color buttons in color allowed even if no js label background label background label background set some styles for our highlighted selected if current selected highlight border 2px solid padding the select if you want to add more effects is demonstrated elsewhere on

 is nice little language with great a really good way to get into something totally different than usual webapps you know the php level stuff all look alike compared to life great to earn a few bucks on a a healthy and vibrant second life lsl programmers are in and micropayments in second life are alive and big is second and it really matter how big it the real question most people want to know it the next big it might or it might fail maybe it already failed as mainstream product and defined itself as niche but whatever it technologically bleeding just like amazon web services or it is also only 3d mmo world which is not a game and more resembles facebook is a 2d web world of linden labs of second are also leading the only existing initiative which tries to connect 3d worlds and standardize which is pretty smart compared to other web platforms like amazon and google who are still trying to lock developers into their for the sake of maximum of 70 people in one second life simulator tell simulator is equivalent of physical space in second and is something like web server in 2d how much users can concurrently access one web server tell much about a website it and you can always add more web big second life events usually span multiple simulators and there are thousands of a that compares the landmass of second life to several other references some of the more useful current statistics maximum concurrent minimum concurrent users at any users logged in last 60 is way lesser than wow which hit 1 million concurrent users in china alone in april but then all content in wow is pretty much developed by so you really have an option to create content in it worth if looking to get into lsl just because it might be mainstream some probably not worth the other still a new and still relatively easy to create something original in in a year or it be as in competition in fashion market in sl is much more fierce and really hard to top available great time to get into fashion in second life was about two years ago not too late but you have to be really are roughly four kinds of good reasons to learn lsl can a second life user who wants to be able to create things you do without lsl have somebody else who can do it for you or want to pay a programmer interested in 3d virtual want to earn some extra money in a fun way and though there are people to whom second life pays bills more exception than a a programmer and want to work with professional escorts and and really want to know how old or good looking the chick is in real life second life is great for stumbling into different and lsl skills will take you to some places where java simply aware that creating 3d content in second life usually involves more than easy to cross into 3d architecture also likely that work with fashion real architects trying to prototype buildings in and all kinds of different	
 is no clear answer whether sql portability is desirable or not it really depends a lot on the such as the type of the application is going to be a service ie there will only ever be you hosting then obviously nobody but you will care whether your sql is portable so you could safely ignore it as long as you have no specific plans to drop support for your current the application is going to be installed at a number of which each have their own established database obviously sql portability is very important to it lets you widen your potential and may give a bit of piece of mind to clients who are on the fence in regards to their database whether you want to support or you are happy selling only for oracle or only to for is up to you and what you think your market you are coding in then the vast majority of your potential customers are probably going to expect if then not a big deal to assume or similarly if you are in then you could assume microsoft sql there is a flip side because there may exist a small but less competitive market of php or users who want to connect to other database systems than the i would largely regard this as a market research unless as in my first example you are providing a hosted service where it matter to in which case it is for your own convenience

 is no effective difference between streaming and the same any difference is purely you wanted you could an mp3 from any web server and start playing it while you were downloading it just requires that you buffer some of the data and start sending it to your decoding and playback routines right even so called servers can be you just have to save the bytes as they are being sent across the wire to a applications are just apps that are not designed to save the files to is an two if you are streaming such as radio or other types where you need then they stream using this can still be saved if you but more packet oriented than stream second is when encryption is in which case you can still probably save the but it would be useless without the encryption algorithm and

 is no way to removing the throwing function from the stack the whole purpose of the stack trace is to log the exception path so allowing a function to opt out would defeat the only way you could change this is if you returned the exception instead of throwing but that forces you to depend on the caller to know to throw the static exception return new the call to ensure the stack is reset to the point of the

 is not a solution is more efficient in terms of where the array may be sparse you can use null pointer to represent a matrix line of all this would be each would be allocated 2d array is not necessarily an array of will generally be faster in terms of since it works out memory locations with without having to memory talking of the 1d array of the unlikely to be any faster than the equivalent 2d version since you still have to do the calculations at some point to find the correct cell in your code rather than letting the compiler do edit where java was added as a believe java 2d arrays are of the array of arrays variety will require two memory accesses as opposed to the one required for a 1d so the 1d array with manual index calculation may well be instead of declaring and may get more speed just need to be careful that you get the formula mixed up anywhere swap 4 and 7 speed difference is based on how i think java is coded under the covers so i could be wrong i doubt it my advice as always for optimisation

 is not an iterator like in and itself is actually a really simple concept once you understand how blocks work in blocks are a functional programming even though ruby is not properly a functional in ruby uses the method to create block which is borrowed from syntax for creating anonymous functions which is what blocks from a computer science blocks lambda are in methods usually take only one can pass but keyword in ruby is just a way of calling a block been given to a these two examples are output yield calling our block here with puts value is the tells ruby to convert an object without calling output explicitly calling the block puts value is the first just assuming a block and say to call in the ruby wraps the block in an object and passes it as an the first is more efficient and but effectively the call either one like a a it would print the value that wound up getting assigned to so a completely stupid but i think you get the are used for a lot of things in almost every place use a loop in a language like replaced in ruby with methods that take for print prints returns value 2 returns andrew also commonly used for opening files and many other basically anytime you have a standard function that could use some custom logic sorting an array or processing a use a there are other uses but this answer is already so long afraid it will cause heart attacks in readers with weaker hopefully this clears up the confusion on this

 is not something that can be because promotion in essence is about selling the idea that is good and whilst majority of your staff might agree on the point it make things you need to do is to build an environment conductive to remove barriers and obstacles that let employees innovate promotion is often about rewarding some desirable but you need to reward innovation because it is a reward in witnessed one time too many a situation when management says now start giving us all your great and innovative ideas have a competition of some kind and the originator of the best idea will get a this is so wrong on so many is a process and idea is just an end wrong to reduce the process and environment just to the end as you bribe your kid into becoming a word famous singer by simply promising her a you need to create an environment supportive of her becoming a singer first and then she might or might not become a are putting ideas into life is pure thought experiments lead to one need to put time and money into real of the best ideas be evaluated not until a long time after they were invented and is not an area where you really want your staff to quite the contrary

 is not the only consideration in this even on high performance mpi offers a standard and is it is relatively trivial to switch an application between the different versions of mpi implementations use sockets for tcp based odds are good that any given mpi implementation will be better optimized and provide faster message than a home grown application using sockets should you ever get a chance to run your code on a cluster that has the mpi layer will abstract any of those code this is not a trivial advantage coding an application to directly use ofed another ib implementation is very mpi applications include small test apps that can be used to verify the correctness of the networking setup independently of your this is a major advantage when it comes time to debug your the mpi standard includes the for profiling mpi this interface also allows you to easily add or other data verification to all the message passing

 is not truncated when there are it will only have the program name and not the path when a program is run from a directory listed in the path environment any what you are trying to do here is not good design for a data files are not stored in the same directory as program files because doing so makes it difficult to apply proper security best way to get what you want in my opinion is to use a shell script to launch the actual this is very similar to how firefox launches on linux the shell places the name of the script into and this variable will always have a then you can use an environment variable or command line argument to give your program the location of the data like i would arrange your program so that files are somewhat like

 is several things together kind of a virtual combined with different frontends that take the input in a particular language and output the result in an intermediate this intermediate output can be run with the virtual or can be used to generate a standalone problem with concurrency is although it was used for a long time in scientific it has just recently has become common in consumer so while widely known how to program a scientific calculation program to achieve great it is completely different thing to write a mail user processor that can be good at most of the current were being designed with a single processor in and they may not be fully prepared for multicore benefit of llvm with respect to concurrency is that you have an intermediate and if in the future there are advances in then by updating your interpreter you instantly gain those benefits in all this is not so easy if you had compiled to a standalone so llvm solve the concurrency problem per se but it leaves an open door for future there are more possible advances for the hardware like quantum genetics but we have to wait for them to become a

 is the reason for requiring a test plan by links to a great of this issue which includes comments by michael schwern and ovid who are the and maintainers apparently this comes up every once in a while on the list and is a bit of a contentious here are the to not use a test annoying and takes not worth the time because test scripts die without the test harness noticing except in some rare can count tests as they you use a test plan and need to skip then you have the additional pain of needing a to use a test only takes a few seconds to if it takes your test logic is too there is an in the code your test will complete successfully without running the remaining test an observant human may notice the screen output look but in an automated test suite it could go developer might accidentally write test logic so that some tests never really have a progress bar without knowing ahead of time how many tests will be this is to do through introspection and have a method which should be called at the end of the test this is the approach i take fixes the problem where code has an in it fix the problem of logic which unintentionally skips tests its safer to use a but the chances of this actually saving the day are low unless your test suites are complicated they should not be using is a middle its probably not a huge deal whatever your this feature been useful to anyone in the real few people mention that this feature has been useful to them in the real this includes larry michael schwern the feature originates with more than 20 years other languages have this of the xunit type testing suites has the test plan i come across any examples of this feature being used in any other programming

 issue is that gui controls have a requirement that only code executing on the same thread that was used to instantiate the gui control can access the gui the reasons behind this requirement are tied to the way that windows is suffice to it would very difficult to change invokerequired checks the identity of the current executing thread against the identity of the instantiating if they are the the code can freely interact with the if the code must marshal the data across from the current thread to the instantiating this is a slow and costly process and is to be avoided if at all your code will work if you always invoke and it may be that you will not notice the performance but this scenario is going to be increasingly common as systems come into it is best not to create code that have to be undone

 java and avoid separate they make full use of they differ is that they require the programmer to write a pair of separate files when writing a reusable the user writes the definition of a class and the compiler extracts the information equivalent to the from that single definition and includes it in the output file as so the output file full of files in or an assembly in is a combination of binaries and headers in a single when another class is compiled and it depends on the first it can look at the metadata instead of having to find a separate include happens that they target a virtual machine rather than a specific chip but a separate they could put x86 machine code in as the binary and still have the metadata in the same file as well is in fact an option in albeit rarely compilers it is common to try to speed up compilation by using the metadata in and files is much like a header already parsed and ready for rapid upshot is that in these modern there is one way of doing and it has the characteristics of a perfectly organised and modular build system pretty speaking

 know that xpath would be a perfect fit for such or any other xml such as dom really not a hard thing to stuff your string into the method then call on it with something like to get a list of elements with the unwanted trying to use regular expressions to solve this with no is it with people keep using them even when they know the wrong even though frequently unreadable and difficult to get right the endless my regex questions so attractive about the damned there are several questions on so every day about parsing with all answered use regex is not powerful enough to parse but somehow it never gets guess a mistake in the pattern appears to be trying to match entire tags to replace with an empty which what you instead want to be targeting just the then to ensure only attributes inside a have to use a negative lookbehind but you usually have a lookbehind which you would need to allow other attributes to come between the tag name and the targeted your clause has the potential to gobble up large amounts of unintended as got guaranteed properly quoted so you need that the mistake is not the it is

 know there are plenty of methods in java and other frameworks like apache commons which convert a string to all upper there any common libraries that provide a method like and to check if all the characters in the string are upper or lower good answers about converting to upper and comparing to i guess i should have been a bit more and said that i already had thought of but i was hoping to be able to use an existing method for comment about possible inclusion of this in has even submitted a patch hopefully we will see this i needed this method was to capitalize names of hotels that sometimes came in all i only wanted to capitalize them if they were all lower or upper did run in to the problems with non letter chars mentioned in some of the and ended up doing something like static boolean c return return discussion and differing solutions different clearly shows that there is a need for a good solid method in then i guess that the is the best way to there an existing library method that checks if a string is all upper case or lower case in

 knowing what your model looks i can only assume that what doing is pushing blobs of binary data to the server and you want to push the entire blob back at asking why in this scenario you would want to do a basic pattern where you take the data trying to split it into you send a chunk with a sequence number to the server and continue sending chunks asynchronously in whatever order you feel when the server has received all of the chunks this possibly by you already having sent a to the it can commit all those chunks to a database or disk or you are dealing with rows of data rather than chunks of binary data the pattern is still fairly regardless of your ajax implementation the goal would be to determine how many rows you plan on sending set up some kind of progress bar that updates and then continually invoke a method that submits one row of changed each time you do that you can then inch the progress bar forward and allow the user to remain fully aware of the progress of the pattern should work regardless of how storing your underlying

 languages might permit but neither community condones the monkeypatching condoned in either but you hear about it more often in ruby because the form of open class it uses makes it very easy to monkeypatch a class and because of more acceptable in the ruby but still frowned monkeypatching simply as prevalent or as easy in which is why you hear the same arguments against it in that python does nothing that ruby do to prevent the reason you about it more often in ruby is that this in def puts def puts give you a class that contains two and whereas this in def print def print leave you with a class that only contains the method as redefinition of a class clobbers the previous definition to monkeypatch in you actually have to write def print print is harder than the ruby that alone makes ruby code much easier to monkeypatch than python

 let me say there are no hard and fast rules this is my understanding of ddd and repository but a fairly subjective from a ddd perspective what you might want to do when adding an answer to an existing question is something like the following style new var question you are using an orm that handles change tracking and that is configured to cascade child objects back to the database that is all you would need to do thinking of nhibernate but other orms can work in a similar by adding the answer to the question you have told the orm that you want the answer to be persisted in the database when the unit of work you typically call not a very way of approaching things where answer is in the same aggregate as question and question is the aggregate getting the objects out of the typically you would ask the repository for a question object id and then navigate to the answer from there an answers collection on the question answer in or do something useful this seems like a strange way to save or retrieve the answer object then you might want to whether answer does actually belong in the same or whether it would be better to break it out of the question aggregate

 library exception handling block is the bomb as many have pointed using policies you can do things like logging the wrapping it in a different throwing a new exception instead of the original if you are looking to perform specific actions based on authentication errors or duplicate record errors you could always create specific derived exception classes and catch those exception types which would precludes the need of passing any objects from the top exceptions should always bubble up not

 linked lists are interesting beasts for game for somewhat common practice to have an intrusive or renderable or class whatever renderable renderable or if renderables come into and out of existence they can register themselves with this list without causing any memory if their render depth or priority is changed they can remove and reinsert it comes time to all you need to do is find the head of the list and zip calling the appropriate of many variations on this with multiple separate and you need to have an intrusive list to make this i just find the intrusive ones	
 linked tables break when the table or view on the server is some changes can result in them just becoming others will simply not include all the have found that updating the connect string does not successfully fix this it will usually fix missing but it can still be the only reliable way to do this is to recreate the linked table on the alternative would be to not use a linked table at but use a saved querydef that has the appropriate connect this will never have to be but could be a performance issue as the metadata stored in the table link helps access figure out how to retrieve the without that metadata stored in the table it has to retrieve that information from the server each time the query is	
 linking you need to delete them and entirely and recreate using the linked table manager to refresh odbc links even work reliably when still using as there is data cached in the table link definitions that get refreshed if you change the number of columns in a sql server refreshing the table link with linked table manager will update the number of but you necessarily get an updateable view the original was not clear whether or not lose functionality or that all depends on how much of your logic is in sql server views and stored none of those will work if you link to a jet back

 me if i am wrong but tagged classes and are two different concepts though not necessarely mutally one has the urge of using tags in a class to define the type then one revise their class hiearchy as it is a clear sing of conceptual bleed where an abstract class needs to know the the implementation details that the class parenthood tries to are you using the correct pattern in other words are you trying to coerce behaviour in a pattern that does not naturally support it as is the ability to loosely define a type where a method can accept any types just so long as the necessary methods in the parameter instance are the method will then use the parameter and call the necessary methods without too much bother on the parenthood of the the smelly hint as charlie pointed the use of much like static or other smelly whenever they appear one must ask i doing the right thing here not that they are inhertitly wrong but they are oftenly used to hack through a bad or ill fitted oo

 my current project we use a simplified version of the query object pattern that mausch in our case we have a search criteria object that consists of a field and a and several such objects can be added to a we did have an operator property from the but it was never used so we removed whether the criteria are treated as and or or depends on the search method that is used would say that it is and in of the cases in that find methods themselves do not do a lot with this they will invoke stored procs in the passing the criteria as most of those procs are fairly straight even though we have a couple that does involve some string handling to unpack lists of critera for certain code from a perspective might look something like this controller classes wraps repetetive stuff as instantiating a search object with a configurable populating it with search criteria and customers customer more than one search criterion is needed a collection can be passed inside the finder function the code will loop over the map the present values to appropriate parameters in an sqlcommand approach has worked out rather well for the means that we have created an architecture wher the search objects are defined as abstract classes that merely will define the interface and contain some generic and post the actual search code is implemented in separate decendent which amongst other things allowed us to quickly create a data that could be used for mocking away the database for some of the unit

 my every pear project that was potentially interesting had major points against is targetted at the widest audience there are hacks in place all over the place to deal with php new useful features are ignored if they be emulated on older meaning you end up lagging behind the core language given project tends to grow until it solves problem with a single simple when your php interpreter has to process all of that source code on every page hit the authors may not have designed it to be there is a measurable overhead for processing thousands of unused lines of was always it never felt like i was learning generalizable apis like in other used to use at we discovered that most of our scripts spent their time inside pear code instead of our own replacing that with a very simple wrapper around functions significantly reduced execution time and increased runtime due to the use of prepared used its own at the logic for postgres because the native functions were too new to be used i feel like pear is good as a in many it is likely to be higher quality code than any individual will produce in a short amount of but i would certainly not use it in a popular website not without a lot of tweaking by maintaining my own

 my experience with a couple of coverity prevent for was decidedly worth finding some bugs even in good and a lot of bugs in the worst others have already covered technical so focus on the political the developers whose code need static analysis the are the least likely to use it so afraid need strong management in practice as well as in otherwise it might end up as just a checklist to produce impressive metrics without actually getting bugs any static analysis tool is going to produce false probably going to need to dedicate somebody to minimizing the annoyance from by triaging prioritizing the and tweaking the commercial tool should be extremely good at never showing a false positive more than that alone may be worth the even the genuine defects are likely to generate my advice on this is not to worry comments grumbling that obviously destructive bugs are biggest piece of advice is a corollary to my first take the cheap shots and look at the painfully obvious bugs from your worst some of these might even have been found by compiler but a lot of bugs can slip through those when suppressed by really blatant bugs can be politically with a top ten list of the funniest which can concentrate minds if used

 my opinion a complex compiler is more difficult to write than a complex emulator for the simple reason that the compiler involves much more designing your language xx there is a whole lot of factors to consider not to mention optimizing the output of the compiler generated code which is a black art in with an emulator you have an already environment with a mostly language that you want to any case i recommend anybody to write and write a compiler because it gives you a deeper understanding of just like doctor needs to know about the body anatomy even though he may not need it in his daily i think both skills are very useful and one can actually combine them they are not would like to add to my opinion above is that creating a programming language including to interact with databases etc and that can evolve with future versions but still remain backwards compatible is one of the more challenging areas in also agree that if the platform is unknown you are reverse engineering something then it is much more difficult to do an but otoh that is not what question was was	
 my opinion better to create a file for every where the file is named after the i use a slightly different notation than chad namely a class autoloading is a nice but i use it very often under certain like where classes of the same type are added or removed object start creating classes for identify the actors in your a method of doing this is to write down what your application is supposed to then scan it for nouns and modelling your classes after because a class represents a single class namens are singular most of the if there are multiple you should name it objectcollection or something like this try want to create a little book library app to keep track of my book it should track the books i the the and the friends i lent them for every friend the phone number should be so i can call all the information is stored in a represents a book represents a collection of already covered by property of a you build the which objects contain other how does the relation between them look contains 1 or more books book belongs to exactly one book is written by 1 or more can lend a book to 0 or 1 friend and only to one friend at a friend has a phone will also tell you a thing or two about how your database should look everything is do you really need a phone number only a in this you should make it a additionally phone numbers are not really shared between friend objects would make sense if several friends living together having the same number and it often but for now that would be a bit if the noun can be represent by a scalar value and there are no other values connected to it may be overkill to make over time you extend your you decided to store not only the phone but also the address and phone number are quite similar types of so you add other variables for post code and so at a certain point get frustrated because the friend class grew with lots of and some of whom are prefixed to group them together and so so you might decide to relocate those to an own called address you leave the phone number to or just to keep the code clean wrong with but be about class hierarchy and object confuse they are entirely different a class hierarchy arises if similar classes share some properties but are different in so you create one class with the properties and methods they share and child classes which inherit the properties and methods of the parent and also add their own to handle the our library what could that to be i think of anything besides one thing thats a bit but go for it and authors are both both have phone numbers and an but they also because authors write books and friends authors normally borrow your so you might define the name and in the person but clearly belongs to friend while belongs to really make sense because never going to process authors and friends in the same but lets say you needed a list of all the adresses stored in your you could loop over your collection of persons and call to be even php is a bad example for because you can store whatever types you want together in an array and access them in every way you but in stronly typed languages not in java you have to define a datatype for an and possible to store different types if they have a common inheritance restricted to the methods the original class enough of that class inheritance object hierarchy simply states which objects should contain other a library contains book a book contains an author additional to be use names like name it because book objects is what you a good idea to name methods after the data type going to common if they return good naming conventions may be or as in or that are always the same for all objects of a certain class may be class lets if a person can be male or female and storing that as or in the it makes sense define the class constants and so you have and scattered in your all over the that only generate a single instance could be modelled as a good example for this may be the database class highly unlikley you ever need to open more than one transaction at read more about singletons at wikipedia but it may be a bit early for some people think singletons are a bad because more or less in once you implement them this so if you model your database class as a but later decide you need more than one database connection but you have a if you take the singletons may be

 my practical experience i have to that postgresql had quite a performance jump from to our use cases in some instances from to the improvement was smaller but still i know the improvements between and but i expect there is some performance improvement i havent tested it so i would recommend to drop and only create them again after filling the database with your it is much improve the crap out of your postgresql there is so much gain from the default settings are at least sensible in pre times pg was optimized for running on a some especially if you have complicated queries it can help to deactivate nested loops in your which forces pg to use better performing approaches on your did i say that you should go for alternative would be which is not so but in my experience it is in some cases performing much better than mysql and

 my question is suppose you have an interface that defines how a converter would be this interface could have a method and another now suppose we want to have multiple convertxml2html you get the you get the two formats you need to convert in 2 strings matter how you get now you need to create an instance of your converter and convert the question is which is to actually create an elaborate if statement or to load the classes through reflection with the class to demonstrate i wrote a little example of what i in my example i have 2 classes p1 and p2 that share an i also create 50000 of them to show of the speed as it turns out the normal invocation is slightly but i think that in a complex example such as the one i mentioned in the the benefits of creating the classes through the class method is more convenient and more what are your class test public static void try random r new date test1start new for i printable p date test1stop new date test2start new for i printable if 0 p new else p new date test2stop new with invocation took with invocation took catch printable public string p1 implements printable public string return p2 implements printable public string return method to create a new instance based on

 my the biggest problem with code coverage tools is the risk that somebody will fall victim to the belief that code equals most coverage tools just offer statement coverage as opposed to data path or decision that means that possible to get coverage on a bit of code like i i if without ever testing the termination condition on the for possible to get very high from a test that simply invokes your without bothering to validate the or validating it code coverage levels is certainly an indication of insufficient but coverage levels are an indication of sufficient or correct

 myself have used the irepository approach lately that keith you should not be focusing on that pattern there are a few more pieces in the ddd playbook that can be applied for your there is the concept of value objects you can apply in you it would be the the difference between a value object and an entity object is that entities have an vos do the identity really is the sum of not a unique in the book design also a free pdf he explains this very well by stating that an address is really just a point on earth and does not need a separate identity like a that point on earth is the combination of the and it can have latitude and longitude but still those are even vos by definition because a combination of two for combining your entities into a single entity to act do not forget about the services concept in the ddd in your that service would class void do some work for a new is a need for a service when you have two entities that need both need a similar action to coordinate a combination of other in your saving a and creating a blank at the same usualyl require an how would you go about saving the address vo in the you would use an iaddressrepository but since most orms require all objects have an the mark the identity as internal in your so it is not exposed outside of your model this is steven own class make your identity isdbgenerated autosync internal int addressid everything else public string streetnumber public string street public string city

 no single method signature that accepts both an iterable and an obviously you could just accept but that would be a hack as since the enhanced is effectively defined twice for arrays and once for need to provide two overloaded methods as static void for sc static void extends for sc the source of the two methods looks exactly the need to define it twice of course you wrap the array in your own as

 no this is not possible with reflection is primarily aimed at providing meta data inspection information at what asking for is actual code inspection believe it is possible to get the actual bytes representing the il for a method at however it would be just an array of you would have to manually interpret this into il opcodes and use that to determine what methods were this is almost certainly not what looking for is possible though to use an expression tree lambda and analyze that for method however this cannot be done on any arbitrary lambda it must be done an an expression tree lambda	
 no way around it as linq to sql does not check the database before it performs the the only way to do this is to query the database to determine if the duplicate record exists and then add the record if it does linq to sql would support the duplicate property on a sql but unfortunately it does not at the

 not a you could set up a discussion by commit situation using with hooks for a hosted solution and you can also use lighthouse or even fogbugz to work with probably more meant for bug fixing than communication with teams per but i think the basecamp integration might work for a general not perfect but i like it so i thought throw it out think anything out there right now that has the of github perhaps be a good project to actually cvsdude does offer an api for their enterprise so if you wanted to build your own basic discussion system you could do it off of that i suspect looked too closely at it

 not any detail on the requirements of your application which is really key to answering the big win for using gwt is the ease of deployment relative to something like there is nothing easier for the user than pointing their web browser at a url and nothing easier for the operations team than pushing code to the bouncing it and calling it a far as the big area where gwt will come up short would be richer data network this stuff is possible with gwt and some help on the server but the limitations of dhtml start to show even with a powerful toolkit like on the other rcp gives you the full power of java 2d to visualize anything you these kinds of features may not be necessary to you but also the ones that make applications really more than just a mess of tree and data grid been developing with adobe flex for several years now and find it to be really having more or less the same deployment advantages as something like gwt but offering the same kind of power as you might want to check that out	
 not asking for anyone to do this homework for but i bring it up because a very good practical introduction to and but at the same time i feel perhaps a little too this really the best way to teach what key threading concepts are in this what would new programmers using threads for the first time likely fail to have alot of theoretical knowledge about threading but had to do alot of it myself in the does anyone have any caveats for me when writing the link to the original here is the goals create a circular queue class and create a to use it next in thread safe means that operation that changes contents of the queue should executed by only one thread at a in order to avoid data circular queue is implemented as fixed size array where the and end of the queue are indices the as the queue fills beginning and end of the queue shift to higher values as elements added and eventually wrap around the first index in the array to the this class should throw an exception to the caller if the operation create a gui to two threads in a the gui will be able to and start and stop both the and consumer threads and control rate at which they modify would you this homework

 not going to be able to do this the features built into are all scoped to the individual given that going to have to code your own method to handle the best you were using a suggest that you use a fourth make the id column in the three main tables a foreign key in which you stored the fourth and synchronize inserting a row into the fourth table with inserting a row into either of the other something into sequence values into tablea values you want to use a which suggests to me that you really care about the persistence of these id if they really only need to exist while your application is you can just use a static field to store the last used and make a helper static class private static int private static object lockobject new public static int lock return locking strictly but no harm in making this code you can handle the event on each of your three data t new datatablenewroweventargs will insure that whatever method adds a new row to each table whether your code calling or a new row being added via a data bound control each row added will have its id column set to the next

 not sure how this works on other platforms but on the mac there is the following clear distinction in which has little to do with file format causes all subsequent to overwrite the file you just created using so modifies the location of the document that you are working with and stores its current state in that new while leaving the original copy does not have this you export to a specific path only after that a operation will still save to the location of the document as it was before the was even in an application that supports a plethore of file such as which allows you to to various formats of varying an command may still make in fact it makes way more sense than saving a complicated document to seemingly retaining any in the while affecting any subsequent saves to also save to that same the fundamental difference is not in file format or a format but the conceptual difference i described leads to a logical distinction in what qualifies a file format to appear in your and when you might want to relegate it to an

 of the answers so far are and get at different aspects of how a hashtable here is a simple example that might be lets say we want to store some items with lower case alphabetic strings as a simon the hash function is used to map from a large space to a small a naive implementation of a hash function for our example could take the first letter of the and map it to an so has a hash code of has a hash code of would be we have an array of 26 buckets be arraylists in and we put the item in the bucket that matches the hash code of our if we have more than one item that has a key that begins with the same they will have the same hash so would all go in the bucket for that hash code so a linear search would have to be made in the bucket to find a particular our if we just had a few dozen items with keys spanning the it would work very if we had a million items or all the keys all started with or then our hash table would not be to get better we would need a different hash function more	
 of the autotools are not an opaque build system but a loosely coupled as tinkertim already pointed let me just add some thoughts on autoconf and is the configuration system that creates the configure script based on feature checks that are supposed to work on all kinds of a lot of system knowledge has gone into its macro database during the 15 years of its on the one i think the latter is the main reason autotools have not been replaced by something else on the other autoconf used to be far more important when the target platforms were more heterogeneous and and a large variety of different processor architecture had to be i really see its point if you only want to support recent linux distributions and is an abstraction layer for gnu make and acts as a makefile generator from simpler a number of projects eventually got rid of the automake abstraction and reverted to writing makefiles manually because you lose control over your makefiles and you might not need all the canned build targets that obfuscate your to the i strongly suggest an alternative to autotools based on your most notable achievement is replacing autotools in probably the closest you can get if you want to have functionality without m4 it brings windows support to the table and has proven to be applicable in large my beef with cmake is that it is still a least on with all its immanent problems makefile timestamp implicit dependency is a make replacement written in it uses python scripts as build control files allowing very sophisticated its configuration system is not on par with scons is often used for development when adaptation to specific requirements is more important than following you really want to stick with i strongly suggest to read make considered and write your own gnu makefile configured through

 of these questions are things that you need to try different options to see what works that is the problem with there is no way to do almost you need to find out what works for your specific i will give my advice for your i prefer incremental i think it is important for the network weights to be updated after each this is a tough it really depends on the complexity of your how many input output and training patterns that there for your i might start with 100 and try ranges up and down from 100 to see if there is i usually calculate the total error of the network when applied to the test set the training after each if that error increases for about 5 i will stop training and then use the network that was created before the increase it is important not to use the error of the training set when deciding to stop this is what will cause you could also try a probabilistic neural network if you are representing your output as 26 each representing a letter of the this network architecture is good for classification it may be a good idea just to try a few different architectures to see what works best for your

 often have the need to persuade non technical users that ie6 is a very bad idea for any company to be still running and so have a document we are working on to educate home and corporate users here is a summary if it is ie 6 a less secure than other internet has changed a lot since ie 6 was released and there are more threats to data security than ever before including phishing script injection key logging identity theft and which have been taken over for criminal is well documented that ie6 is less secure than modern browsers when surfing the most compelling reason to upgrade is the improved the internet of today is not the internet of five years there are dangers that simply exist back in when internet explorer 6 was released to the microsoft browsers are a of security allowing out there to take over construct and even steal their most of the time without their 6 poses a security risk to any computer that it is used on for web responsible it team will upgrade to ie7 or later on all machines within a corporate many now install the firefox browser in order to increase security is not standards 6 does not render web pages in the same way that most browsers do as it uses a proprietary engine which ignores many of the standards set by the w3c world wide web this leads some web pages to be displayed incorrectly in ie 6 and some not to display at also means that while web developers have to support ie 6 much of their work is taken up by fixing pages rather than developing better content and in short ie 6 is holding back the development for all the last 8 years of browser development as well as improved security browsers have been tuned for better performance on all fronts including download rendering speed and performance which is a technology used on most major sites to give a better end user experience know as web explorer 7 actually uses less memory than ie6 and uses less overall resources on a so upgrading can improve the performance of older to firefox or to ie 7 explorer 7 explorer explorer 7 resource explorer 7 deployment explorer 8 resource explorer 8 deployment

 on the internet has seem to have hit somewhat of a wall for as there are more and more sites that are dependent on javascript for rendering portions of the seems to me that with so many open source layout and javascript renderers released and that someone must have made a tool for downloading a page and rendering its javascript without having to run an actual not turning up what looking for with my searches found tools like but they depend on a running interested in any tool or library which can do one of the program that can be run from the command line given the source of a returns the source as rendered by some js support in a particular language that allows one to pass the source of a page to it and returns the source as rendered by some js think is preferable in a general but would be more useful if the tool exists in the language i want to work not concerned with the particular js engine any relatively modern one will what is out there command line or library tools for rendering webpages that use

 one part of the application working there is a form control that does validation on reception of the cmexit which is exactly how the delphi documentation says to do it code sample is from the delphi help tell data link to update database on exception do if it let focus leave purpose of this is to perform the validation as soon as the control loses for if i were to click on the ok the form control would lose this method would run and on an exception would set the focus back to that form the event on the ok button would never go through and the dialog would never problem having is that this form control is inside a modal dialog clicking ok does indeed send the cmexit message and causes the record to update validation to pressing enter while in the form control causes the modal dialog to close sending the cmexit as if the form control never this means that not only does the dialog close without the form actually validating the but the data set this where is the best place for me to place my dataset i could move it up to the dialog form itself and implement it in the onclosequery but this would mean that the logic is duplicated in both the form control on the form form control is used in other and i want to avoid changing its speculate that cmexit triggered because the control never actually lose the form is but the form control still on the closed cmexit message not sent when modal dialog is

 pass to your inside your you can look for the param you or create a second do any cleaning you need on i return you have a return array and you can do something like be very careful doing this functionname could be any old thing under the sun including it might be a good idea to create an list and check function name against that before allowing it to be the way i put the parms in there as strings in the eval is pretty you could get string escaping in the passed probably better to do a for loop and have it eval the variable names instead of the variable contents as if you actually know the number of arguments to your it ouwld be much safer to just use so	
 passing symetrically encrypted data in a url or possibly storing encrypted data in a is it resonable nessassary possible to also pass the symetric encryption iv in the same is the idea of using salt even valid in a stateless environment such as the understand how salt works in a database given a list of names or accounts but we save the salt given that we are passing data in a stateless a server side password that is used to encrypt data and then decrypt how can salt be i guess a separate iv could be passed in the query string but is publicly exposing the salt can one generate a key and iv from the hash of a assuming the iv and key come from areas of the is this realize that the salt key will always be the same for a given typically using data in url and

 patching hides changes to an object from the rest of the and from the very easy to go use that check documentation to be sure it does what you and then find out later it quite work that is especially bad if you work on a project that sees developer where you need to worry more about how to bring new developers up to speed with your code new developers be aware of the nuances of your patches and have a harder time getting good code out of them as a for the worst that could the worst thing that could happen if a bug in your could someone die because of a piece of equipment functions could you ruin credit rating by sending them the wrong bill or charging too much to their

 patterns contribute or detract from the usability of a cli an example consider the cli for the cli is very comprehensive but it is has several glaring i wanted to force the files to lower case into clearcase using unfortunately i wound up on the documentation for its cousin it may seem slight but it cost me more hours than i care to the variation in the middle got provide such nearly identical functionality with such nearly identical there are many better options in my would be better than what they went the code i am working on a cli and this experience made me look at my own i think i have all the basics covered vs short meaningful providing eliminate accurately handling spaces within there is some on this perhaps a bad cli is no different than a cli are type of an api in some the goals are naturally and several factors differentiate cli from a typical one is that cli needs to support scriptability many times perhaps in a series of another is that autocompletion and namespaces exist in the same you always have a nice colorful gui doing stuff for clis must document themselves externally to customer and finally the audience of a cli is vastly different than the standard i appreciate any insight you may for

 people here are probably familiar with one of most popular blog may i have a where he cries out for a way to remove dependencies on the framework so a application can be developed and of the visual studio development at the replied his views on the arguing that the topic is somewhat moot the ability to fix security problems in the runtime other was their chief the small overhead was worth forward to a few groups out there now claiming to have zander even said himself that it take much to implement instead of the meg download of we now have a massive mb complete installer that contains versions of for and suggestions to decrease the runtime size the remove the target platforms you and put it back the web bootstrapper that only downloads the libraries for your the client profile installer as of late which has limited libraries and only works for make matters as i understand it correct me if the client profile even register with windows as having this means if multiple client applications are installed on the none will see each other and the runtime will be again and really know what microsoft is thinking even assuming the worst case install will be for one target platform and only those libraries need to be still looking at upwards of 60 mb overhead on your even one of the most well known was fraught with installing the application because of the massive if they have problems distributing a free what about the rest of the in the they had to a bootstrapper that installed microsoft installer the runtime and all their other dependent before they could install their own how about a do any good ones exist or a tool that simply makes it possible to build a application without requiring that the user install the massive it looks like a couple of has its own from the answer it looks like it works pretty seems to be one available and is another that was and by another linker by they bill it as an any thoughts another by rustemsoft called skater anyone familiar with by microsoft was also this looks like it only performs part of the task merging not stripping out unused looks like the mono tools are getting how about the based any other experience with or are we just going to have to wait for microsoft to push it out to i shudder to think how long take for to be put state of linkers for apps may i have a 2009

 prefer the first method because you can cast the derived class pointer to the parent class without any the other way c standard guarantees that the address of a struct is the address of the first so in the second case it is safe to cast a pointer to derived to as the first member of derived is the parent and a the struct as a member as the same layout as the same struct when not a so casting a pointer to a derived to parent will always same is not true for the second two structs with some members defined as the same type may have different padding between those would be reasonable for a 64 bit bigendian compiler to a a b that is a whole multiple of 8 and b is 64 bit but b a b c that is a whole multiple of but b is only 32 bit aligned so that it waste

 previous answer was confusing here is a solution that should work for all although still running into some it seems like certain unicode characters for superscript characters are being confused with the actual number you might be able to play around with collations to get around you already have a numbers table in your database can be very but just in case included the code to partially fill that as also might need to play around with the numeric since unicode characters can go beyond table number int not constraint primary key clustered insert into values set join t like like between 127 and

 problem in general terms is the security model of java that actually attempts to prevent that a class that has already been loaded be loaded course java since the beginning has supported dynamic class what it is difficult is class was consider harmful and for a good reason that a running java application got injected with an new class with malicious for instance a cracked implementation comming from the internet that instead of creating deletes some random file hile invoking the method they way java was conceived and i presume clr in because it was highly in was to prevent an already loaded class to load again that same offered a mechanism to override this but again the rules for the class loaders they should ask permission to the classloader before attempting to load a new if the parent has already loaded the the new class is instance i have used classloaders that load a classes from ldap or rdbms hot deploy becomes a necessity in the java world when the application server became mainstream for java ee and also create the need for micro containers like spring to avoid these kind of burden the whole app server after every compile drives anyone app server offer this class loaders to help hot and using a configuration that should be disabled when set in but the tradeoff is you have to use tons of memory in so the good way to do this is restart every 3 4 happen with other languages that were designed from the beginning to load their ruby for you can even add methods to a running override a method at runtime or even add a single method to an unique specific tradeoff in these kinds of environments is of course memory and hope this found this product some time ago that promises that reload is make as simple as i remember the link when i first wrote this and i is from

 problem we have now in our team is that when you need to start with different you need to spend huge time amount for reviewing and understanding this it what it what or some size manuals how environment or stubs can be set for component setup or for find this situation very because when you start to working with someone else first you need to ask him for very long time period huge amounts of questions accordingly to before you can understand it enough and start by this is some sort of developer business process and developers have to work to eliminate such problems for future we should post much more information to our so when you need to grasp some new all you have to do is to search for all tickets of this component and read what do you think about you can recommend some book on this this problem can be solid to build knowledge

 purpose of caching is so that the requests no longer need to be processed in meaning that the database have to be the content have to be templates event handlers and so static objects this way yields no performance improvement as there is no processing required for static process these items iis will probably cache them through the caching should note that caching is automatically done by clients for static so very unlikely that revisiting clients download the same object

 put this edit at the top since it directly answers your question of why word is your copy constructor is const theobject make a copy of what points just the so you effectively have two objects pointing to the same internal this gets very bad when a word object gets a proper implementation the techniques you i recomend against would be like const theobject new 1 earwicker noted the following as although that is not a copy so one will and does the same and therefore the same still remedy need to make a proper copy constructor which should have the word this code infile new word like you reallocate after word is read and entirely forget to delete the previous once again show a sane implementation using the techniques you are attempting to infile new word how it counts the then allocates room after it knows how much to now is ready to be used for up to word you just replace the class with it would make the code much smaller and easier to work it makes it easier for just do you can do like it has the added bonus of removing the need for you to use the member to get the would also change your to just be a that way you can simple do more dynamic all done for size of the word array will be limited only by the amount of ram you because grows as needed when you use if you do what to get the word count you simply do need to manually keep track of the number of this code is infile2 eof set till you attempt a you are better off using this will correctly stop on if you do this there should be very little actual code you need to a sample straight forward implementation of what i think you from the menu items it seems that the intention is for the user to choose option then zero or more times to filter out some then finally c to print the results word per option really needed since hitting sends an eof to the program and makes the test thus ending the least in my it might be for it makes no effort did to deal with but here it public bool char const return make a read a text remove words starting with print words to const int const char char case case a file scope so we can have locals int words read from the file case case scope so we can have locals letter to char remove all words starting with a certain case case output each word to separated by return

 python the interface of an iterable is a subset of the this has the advantage that in many cases they can be treated in the same there is an important semantic difference between the since for an iterable returns a new iterator object and not just how can i test that an iterable is really an iterable and not an conceptually i understand iterables to be while an iterator only manages the iteration keeps track of the but is not a collection difference is for example important when one wants to loop multiple if an iterator is given then the second loop will not work since the iterator was already used up and directly raises is tempting to test for a but this seems dangerous and somehow should i just check that the second loop was there any way to do such a test in a more pythonic i know that this sound like a classic case of lbyl against so maybe i should just give or am i missing says in his answer below that this is primarily a problem of wanting to do multiple passes over the and that one should not do this in the first in my case the data is very large and depending on the situation has to be passed over multiple times for data processing is absolutely no way around iterable is also provided by the and for situations where a single pass is enough it will work with an iterator created by a generator for but it would be nice to safeguard against the case were a user provides only an iterator when multiple passes are this is a very nice example for base the methods in an iterator and an iterable have the same name but are sematically so is but provides a clean to tell the difference between an iterator and an

 quality begins with the language in languages are tools and have strengths and so any definition for code quality must consider in quality code exploits the strength of the language while exhibiting minimal dependence on its established we then can see that the skill of the coder is really what we are looking for in this means that money has no place in this some of the best code ever seen never made a it also means that the number of bugs in the code is not a good factor consider that code may work exactly as the requirements dictate thus making the bug an aspect of the requirements and not the code that flawlessly implements perfectly correct requirements can still be of low so correctness or lack of bugs can only be part of the leaves two other things to consider in making our ease of maintenance and performance when of maintenance is harder to but it has to do with the difficulty in reading and understanding the code of course brings in another the skill of the that might best be measured in it also has to do with the difficulty in changing the after code that is engineered well anticipates extensions to some so forethought in design that enables changes without whole scale restructuring makes for higher we all have faced the prospect of altering code significantly only to find that we are better off with a complete in execution is more than just it means writing code that is not as in setting values that remain unchanged within loops rather than outside the the comment above about efficient use of resources is very good as

 question as amended actually has less to do with threading and more to do with how to stop long running personally i always use apm for lengthy stream and communications activities such as large file each callback runs on an io completion pool thread and completes processing a modest chunk and scheduling the next pending operations can be cancelled simply by calling on the socket this is a great deal cheaper and more efficient than diy thread already is bad karma and should be material below was written prior to exclusion of the looping case from the long running processes loop they should include an exit flag in their loop condition so that you can signal them to of service a method on some other foreach in more if you ought to use volatiles but since only the control logic ever sets the flag it technically a race condition exists but that just means you might go round one more	
 question boils down to not use exception for that handling for regular program avoid all i could have googled i will provide an example you all can attack at and java too many have with plenty of types some of behaviour i like at for example 1 seen my vicious add some insult to this injury and even expand this behaviour say datetime know datetime is sealed in but for the sake of this using a pseudo language is exactly like except for the fact that datetime sealed overridden add method increments this date with a but loops the maximum value for datetime is timespan to incremented with the given if is the sum wil and continue from public datetime override return catch calculate how much the maxvalue is regular program timespan saldo ts return exception course an if could solve this just as but the fact remains that i just fail to see why you use exceptions that i can see that when performance is an issue that in certain cases exceptions should be think in many cases they are more clear than and break any contract the method is the use them for regular program everybody seems to have is not that well underbuild as the of that reaction can am i read other dealing with all kind of special but my point is if you are clear and hounour the contract of your nothing wrong with shoot not use exceptions as regular flow of

 quiet new in ddd so hesitate to comment if you as you here to i understand why you should reference the infrastructure layer from your in my opinion the domain be dependent on the the domain objects should be completely ignorant on which database they are running on or which type of mail server is used to send by abstracting the domain from the infrastructure it is easier to because the domain know on which infrastructure its i do in my code is reference the domain layer from my infrastructure layer not the repositories know the domain objects because their role is to preserve state for the my repositories contains my basic crud operations for my root aggregates and are called from within my i did on my last project approach purely ddd but it worked pretty is that i abstracted my repositories with the root aggregates had to be instantiated by passing a concrete type of a root aggregate had to be instantiated through a repository by using the or a method of the the concrete repository constructing the object passed itself so that the aggregate could preserve his state and the state of his child objects but without knowing anything of the concrete implementation of the class public post post return public post existingpost class private ipostrepository internal public

 quite know why you want to just commit all snapshots i a shell script to do is probably less than 5 lines of code and less than 10 minutes of there is which would allow you to cut that down to maybe 3 lines and 5 but you still have to load every dir if you are so there is the tool which is intended to make writing repository converters and importers according to the you could write an importer in about 100 lines and a couple of all this ignores the biggest the of a vcs lies in the you could just as well use regular backups for but in the commit and no magic tool is going to help you have to type them all in yourself and more have to remember exactly you made every single little change over the last	
 quite recently learned about the classes friend keyword and the uses in serialization and now i need some help in getting it to have no problem serializing my class to a working however having a hard time trying to read this file into a vector sure i need a loop in my code that reads line by but since the class has different types i guess i use and also maybe that approach use the istream method i sample output file would salespeople friend ostream salespeople friend istream salespeople string int int bool salespeople stream stream stream stream return salespeople stream stream stream not sure how to read that empty extra line here return need some help here trying to read the file into a cerr to open input return i am pretty sure i need a loop here and should go line by line to read all the however the class has types and im not sure how to use the istream method the i know that the boost library has a great serialization however trying to learn how serialization would work using the stl library for a lot in advance for any help that you can give me and for getting me in the right class

 rather a lot of good literature on implementing malloc and similar but i notice that you include here are you aware that you can write your own implementation of and in that might be useful as a way to do it any the characteristics you want are going to depend pretty heavily on your that on the pattern of usage over if you have only mallocs and new if you have only mallocs of or a few block also other you get some leverage by having the ability to chain memory but c that basic implementation of malloc simply allocates a header that contains the data an use and the malloced malloc then constructs a new header at the end of its allocates the and returns a when you it just resets the in use trick is that when you do a lot of mallooc and you can quickly get a lot of small blobs that in but are hard to so you need some kind of bumpo gc to merge blocks of could do a more complicated but remember that takes you want a free to take up a lot of a paper on solaris malloc implementations you might find another building an alternative again in but the basics are the and you should read the on garbage and follow it to some of the more formal you really should have a look at generational garbage the basic idea is that the longer something remains the more likely is it to this is an extension of the gc you you allocate new stuff in one part of your memory call it when you reach a high water mark on you look through the allocated blocks and copy the ones that are still in use to another section of call it then you can just clear the g0 space and start allocating eventually g1 gets to its high water mark and you fix that by clearing and clean up g1 moving stuff to and when you rename the old g1 as g0 and vice versa and trick is that in c the handles you hand out to memory are straight raw you really move things around without some heap big asks moving stuff around just be a and indeed it but consider this this is not and just for for entertainment no warranty express or basic environment for mymemoryhdl char this will be your memory mallocate some if we get past it succeded your implementation of you create the memory and return a pointer to the char nextunusued partitionsize hwm so g0 will be the bottom half and g1 the top half to start char g0 char g1 void rtn memory completely exhausted return otherwise add header at nextunused includes some pointers for and a field with values used or set to used nextunused headerlen this could be niftier rtn nextunused nextunused size of the things are free set the flag in the using an now you do all the stuff and you get to your high water each block in your memory pool block header is still marked used block into other partition clear the partition go back to the original handle you saved in what does it point you just set it to 0x00 with where the magic comes in c at the pointer you returned from your malloc is no longer under your control you move it around after the in with you can fix

 real question is why you need this to not be if it should not be cached because it changes all the the server should specify to not cache the if it just changes sometimes one of the resources it depends on can and if the client code has a way of knowing about it can append a dummy parameter to the url that is computed from some hash or last modified date of those resources what we do in microsoft ajax script resources so they can be cached forever but new versions can still be served as they if the client know of the correct way should be for the server to handle head requests properly and tell the client whether to use the cached version or to me like appending a random parameter or telling from the client to never cache is wrong because cacheability is a property of the server and so should be decided question to ask oneself is should this resource really be served through get or should it go through that is a question of but it also has security implications are attacks that work only if the server allows for post will not get

 real thing to consider is what your program does with the relational databases are designed to handle complex relationships between sets of not designed to perform complex the amount of data and relative simplicity of it suggests to me that you could simply use a flat file to store the coordinates and read them into memory when this way you can design your data structures to more closely reflect how going to be using this rather than how going to store languages provide a mechanism to write data structures to a file and read them back in again called is one such and sure you can find one for whatever language you just design your classes or data structures as dictated by how used by your program and use one of these serialization libraries to populate the instances of that class or data the requirement that the structures be mutable really affect much with regard to my answer i still think that serialization and deserialization is the best solution to this the fact that users need to be able to modify and save the structures necessitates a bit of planning to ensure that the files are updated completely and but ultimately i think end up spending less time and effort with this approach than trying to marshall sqlite or another embedded database into doing this job for only case in which a database would be better is if you have a system where multiple users are interacting with and updating a central data and for a case like that be looking at a database server like or sql server for both speed and also commented that going to be using as your has support for serialization so you should be to

 reasonable implementer would just use a bitmap internally in the and draw to that using os native drawing does it not at all related to if what for the html parser sees a canvas element a given width it needs to allocate an onscreen pixmap to cover that it either does this manually or it calls into some os native drawing api to create a surface to draw the os native api could be or any other drawing library that the implementer of the browser highly dependent on the operating internet explorer probably calls into some windows native library directx or the drawing surface is made accessible to the internal guts of the javascript likely via a pointer or handle to the constructed drawing when the js interpreter sees an invocation of one of the canvas it turns this into a call to the appropriate os native using the windows style using a manually managed height it matter to the javascript developer how these methods are the only people who need to care are the ones who are writing html5 compliant web browsers with canvas

 recommend that you consider the approach known as vertical this means that you keep defining tables with a userid you could call them start a new table when you hit the maximum row size for your the benefit of this approach is that the values are still true database this will wind up saving time when working with this data key question to answer are these really do they represent the struture of information that you must collect about the if the best way to model them is to make them the only reason you must resort to vertical partitioning is the row size limit of the on the other a flexible attribute system is called then by all means go with the property value for if users were allowed to define their own attributes then definitely want the i would say is not the best way if you understand the structure of your data and have legitimately identified hundreds of attributes for a side i must say that you should question entities with large numbers of they may be but also quite likely that missing some entities at the conceptual in other mabe all of these attributes related to the user per but to some other entity that is related to

 recommend using a separate presentation model type in most aside from the issue of binding is but there are other ways around this i think that there are other reasons why using presentation model types is a good models allow create a view and a presentation model at the same get your user representative to give you feedback on the iterate until both solve the problem of mapping this back to the models remove dependencies that the model might allowing easier unit testing of models will have the same as the view so you have to write code in the view to deal with navigating into and the models be used in an action for an object graph which contains cycles cannot be serialized to

 recommendation is to keep the database schema definition under source using the scm repository and as the rest of the code in the that way easier to keep the database in sync with the application that uses it would be embarrassing for the application to query a table that development typically is going on in different branches of source control version version and version early you need database instance per this allows you to modify the database design for version and as without interfering with the stability of maintenance work on version definitely need a separate database instance for versus i worked on an app that sent notification emails to i want users to be confused by spurious emails sent by my test in my test i changed all the email addresses to mock addresses at my own so i could verify they were being sent as many times as i needed without bothering i do that if i were using the same database for test and on your team should have their own including all components of the system as the that way each developer can work able to make changes and invoke debuggers and without interfering with the work of anyone else on the the other this may not be setting up a complete duplicate system for each developer may be too compare the cost of this setup work to the potential for gains in since developers have to coordinate testing with each other as

 refactoring the way the client code for a web service is the existing build creates the java client code by using a deployment of the web service on jboss and executing the axis 2 antcodegentask against this method fails if the development server is down or has outdated control fails whenever the wsdl need to build the client code against the web service class itself instead of having to point to a deployment of the web i use java2wsdl to generate wsdl from the web service class and then use the same antcodegentask to generate the client problem is that wsdl created by java2wsdl is different than what jboss displays in among other some of the namespaces are different and the antcodegentask step convert these namespaces into the correct package got to get the final package structure to be what the client code the existing antcodegentask uses to accomplish but when i execute the same antcodegentask to the wsdl generated by java2wsdl it convert the namespaces to the package would axis show different wsdl when the web service is deployed in jboss than it generates from there a way to use axis to create the client code from the web service class without generating the intermediate documentation for the java2wsdl and wsdl2java ant tasks is a little bit axis 2 v gives ant tasks for antcodegentask and 2 java2wsdltasks in different the axis 2 installation includes binaries for wsdl2java and but no codegen maybe antcodegentask is the same as anyone got something like this to work with axis 2 java2wsdl creates different wsdl than jboss shows in the

 reputation system is without real life if anonymous people can be invited then it can always be with sufficient effort and false aim should be to increase the cost of such gaming above the potential which will depend on what your system gets used main cost you can use to inhibit power gains is forcing users to contribute positively reviewed contributions before you increase their you do and how you make it difficult for them to leverage existing identities to falsely rate as positive the contributions of new identities they are trying to give power is the nuts and bolts of the and should make use of an existing user base to spot and penalise spurious false can make use of game theory by rewarding people for being in the so if a accuses b of it is highlighted and lots of people get to vote on those who cast their mojo on the side of the vote that ends up get it back and increase in reputation for reliability is worth having more than one type of while those in the lose a triangle number of mojo the first 2 the 3 the 6 the 10 the and so

 requires minimal file which i believe is the main cause of problems when using this kind of shared resource over a network file the reason it can get away with this is that most of the files in a git all the ones that form the object are named as a digest of their and immutable once so there the problem of two clients trying to use the same file for different content come other part of the object database is the refs are stored in files under the directory in and these do although the files are small and always rewritten rather than being in this git writes the new ref to a temporary file and then renames it over the target if the filesystem respects even if the worst that could happen would be a race overwriting a ref although this would be annoying to it should not cause corruption as it just might be the case that you push to the shared and that push looks like it succeeded whereas in fact someone but this could be sorted out simply by pulling in the other and pushing i think that repo corruption is too much of a problem true that things can go a bit wrong due to locking but the design of the git repo will minimise the this all sounds good in but not done any concurrent hammering of a repo to test it and only share them over nfs not

 say launching a python script from a cgi but you specify what language the cgi script is written because cgi is simply an not clear what language the cgi script is written going to assume since that makes the most would work best would be to write your messages out to a log in your instead of using you should open a log file for like wherever you have a print statement like to do step it to a statement like to do step that you will need to add newlines separately as does not add one for you can watch going on in your script with a command like will show data as it gets appended to your log

 say you are writing a large scale if you have made significant progress on you are already pass the point where you can justify using google app engine or both require significantly different architectures than you have build with a traditional application due to language database and app engine is python only so switching to it would require a complete rewrite table is not a relational database and requires very different coding sql data services originally announced to be as but is moving to be more i have not seen how close to a standard mssql database it currently would consider google app engine to be a relatively immature platform so database functionality is you cannot run background profiling and performance tuning tools are limited at azure is currently in limited community and so is not even available to ship a product on there are many very valid reasons to use a cloud moving to it will require significantly different think about what effect changing that architecture possibly waiting for platform will do to your release you are early in your cloud not cloud is a great question to if you have well on your i think that the importance of getting to shipping code and leveraging the work you have already put in should trump any benefits to the cloud you may	
 say your rule of thumb is not my the core concern is the code or does it address business is ok to have code in the if that code is strictly here to modify the view and not to carry out any kind of business your example of changing a font size is a prime example of code that is perfectly fine in a view would increase noise in a making it harder to understand and you already do some of that if you use so not that in mind if you use unit it will be very difficult to test that bit of if you need it you might be better off putting it in the

 see anything in your requirement that says a user needs to know what a url if you implement this you are implying you may end up with things like or if you then wanted to change the way urls were have to change all the it would be preferable to have all objects in your system have an id and a view helper class which has a method such you absolutely need to do is isolate objects in your model from the plumbing of how they are located and leave the locating up to the web framework you are a general best practise is that every class specifies an id and a handler in your web infrastructure depends upon the class it it retrieves the class by an id passed to you see the dependency is one the view class depends upon the underlying but the model does not depend upon how it if you subsequently want caching of you can implement this at the view again the underlying object has no knowledge or dependency on whether it is being

 seem to be two major ways of mapping to relational all the attributes from the parent class and all the child classes and put them in the together with a class is each object is serialized as one row in one one table for the parent class and one table for each child the table for the parent class table contains the class is the child class table contains a foreign key pointing to the parent class each object is serialized as one row in the parent class table and one row in the child class one really scale it quickly winds up with lots of nullable almost always and scary but it is fairly simple for small class two scales much but is more it also results in many more tables in your suggest taking a look at method two for your tables to they sound like child tables of a or you will then have a very clear and easy place to attach to the

 seen a lot of questions related to mapping dtos to domain but i feel they answered my used many methods before and have my own opinions but looking for something a little more have many domain we are using a csla model so our domain objects can be pretty complex and they contain their own data you do not want to pass these around on the we are going to be writing some new services that will return data in a number of formats for this other we are also creating a data transfer object to pass around on the question is how should the dto and domain object be first reaction is to use a dto seen this done many times and it feels right to the domain object contains no reference to the an outside entity or is called to create a dto from a domain normally there is an orm on the domain object the downside of this is that the tends to get extremely complex for any real situation and can be very idea put forth is for the domain object to the since just a lean data the domain object properties would internally reference the dto properties and could just return the dto if asked i can see no problems with this but it feels i have seen some articles where people using nhibernate appeared to use this there other is one of the ways above worth if so or if for any insight in practices for mapping dto to domain

 seen compilers that emit any if no function at all exists defined in one implementation file instead of a header they would throw errors like or something and you would be confused as as i not conformant with the but it happens so consider putting at least one virtual function not in the header only the virtual so that the compiler could emit a vtable for the class at that i know it happens with some versions of someone inline virtual functions can be a benefit but of course most often you will use it when you do know the dynamic type of the because that was the whole reason for in the first compiler however completely ignore it has other semantics apart from speeding up a the for definitions is the mechanism which allows you to put the definition into the only functions can be defined multiple times throughout the whole program without a violation any in the it behaves as you would have defined it only once in the whole even though you included the header multiple times into different files linked

 short michael working effectively with legacy longer biggest challenge when maintaining such an application is doing it without breaking this means you need to understand the behaviour of the and the easiest way to do this is to get tests around as this can be daunting at but it is not it requires discipline and have to start with unit usually easier to get an automation such as nunitforms or to drive the application as a black box build up a suite of tests around the area you need to change to give you enough confidence to change it without breaking then go in and start refactoring towards unit anything like the application working it mainly unused code a public static method calls and replacing them with interfaces injection is a key technique duplicated code into file network and user interface code behind adapters can be very thin wrappers at just enough so that you can replace them with stubs when for opportunities to extract behaviour into small it will be easier to rewrite sections of the code rather than refactor but that requires an understanding of the either through testing or by referring to a spec one from any practical if part of a team working on this make sure you are it will make the work more enjoyable and ensure that changes you make today undone tomorrow by someone who understand what you were working could write all day on this but mr feathers is much better at and good

 should be as terse as necessary and no remarks aside there are several factors affecting just how terse it should longer than you think of likely is dependent on many things but the original coder has a big part to play in reading just the think intellisense and the reading it sometimes with the help of programs like diff not the same person that wrote performance these things combine to produce a set of sometimes competing forces which may want more or less these is the key to effective which are more important is totally dependent on the problem your software is trying to off lets take the easy they read your code they are quite capable of doing so irrespective of the they might be a little slower but this is something that is normally hard to measure is unlikely you will go beyond 1 or two orders of magnitude of verbosity than the minimum theoretical exceptions are where you are something like meta programming via a preprocessor to do lots of expansion for this can take a time when here you must decide if this trade off is worth they will be people with similar context to you and they will be reading the source in a similar situation to when you wrote by this it means that if the function was in a called foo then there is no need to go putting foo in front of the foo aspect of it should be quite clear from this makes changing this aspect easier in familiar with the idioms of the of programming you are using will be quite capable of understanding several constructs which are extremely index variables called for example are as terse as you can get but are normally not a problem until your loop becomes you see an interesting the value of terseness is often proportional to the complexity of the block of code within which it as this block becomes more terse the variables within it benefit more from being by writing code in with limited responsibility it becomes easier and more helpful to keep things terse as there is less scope for confusion on the part of a paradoxically this can lead to the need for the context to be more thus longer method and class lifespan and probability of bugs factor into how often you will have to either read the code or debug through many debuggers support break points at multiple points on a line spotting where there are two but some do therefore care should be taken on if you intend to break point within it a lot to make sure you can place and control these with minimal the code has a low probability of bugs but a long lifespan you have another interesting the probability of the code being comprehensible when you come to need to change it is much lower will have a worse memory or may not even be there any this code therefore will benefit from being slightly less terse than occasion you might have to sacrifice a compact but clear representation of something to satisfy a performance perhaps you must bit pack for never a nice thing to read in code but unavoidable if you have to fit in a certain amount of like these are hopefully language constructs can encourage terse code anonymous inner lambdas to name but a where these concepts make sense to use use them the idea is that they reduce boiler plate and expose you do the same thing repeatedly and have a certain amount of code duplication consider a shared but remember that if you must make the shared code less clear an additional if statement or unused variables in one of the code then you may not have a net inference is powerful but remember that the compiler is sometimes much better at it than a if you are saying x new then x new is no stretch at all gets better as flibble gets compare with flibble common sense helps if you would never have to use intellisense to work it out you certainly should consider using other useful rules of actions on a single line often confuse effects often confuse humans or matter at all conceptually unless part of a wider expression for helps most humans to infer structure far more than brackets rules are often by humans rather than remembered as a set of this means that needless the bracketing can be harmful for readability where the idiom is common but useful where the usage is not so not is often a single when using this in an if statement consider whether it can be restructured to not require this may not be possible the resulting contortions to name or ordering of code outweigh the removal leave it

 should be aware that openid can be more vulnerable to phishing because users know less about if a malicious site pretends to implement but forwards the login attempt to a malicious site under its control imitating a google it can then gain access to that phished account on all openid so if you use there may be a higher probability of bots and malicious or perhaps this will work out in practice and whether it will become a valid security concern is i believe there are also some proposed changes to the openid standard to try and mitigate these though i know the

 should be no significant performance difference between multiple tables in a single database versus multiple tables in separate databases sql uses the term for serve chiefly as a namespace for a database has only a few the default character set and and that usage of makes it convenient to control access privileges per but that has nothing to do with can access tables in any database from a single connection they are managed by the same instance of mysql you just have to qualify the table from is purely a syntactical it should have no effect on you organize tables into a as with the myisam storage you always have a file per with the innodb storage you either have a single set of storage files that amalgamate all or else you have a file per table is configured for the whole mysql not per in either no performance advantage or disadvantage to creating the tables in a single database versus many many mysql configuration parameters that work per most parameters that affect server performance are in you can specify a subset of tables as arguments to the it may be more convenient to back up logical sets of tables per without having to name all the tables on the but it should make no difference to only convenience for you as you enter the backup

 should include the rating field directly in your posts it is a question of and you win nothing if you separate that value because there is no functional some rare situations you might add such fields as separate for example if you have to add the rating value to an existing table and you are unable to add a new column for whatever may be you can gain some performance if the rows are very large and change very infrequent while the rating value changes very i would not say that your case falls into neither so just keep it in the posts am going to summarize some common this if you have a set of possible rating such as and and all posts share this ratingvalue would be a string identifed by an the rating value is a simple just include it in the posts that is probably your include a integer rating value and not a string with a rating the difference is as the integer rating should be included because every value is a legal this is not true for the string they should be moved to a separate because only a limited set of strings represent legal you have multiple ratings per post the following is the way to go for a limited set of possible postid ratingid ratingid you have integer ratings you put them back into the post ratings you need to add an artifical primary key if you require one because there is no natural primary you associate a rating with a user and allow only one rating for a given post per user you get a natural primary key postid userid userid ratingvalue

 should work on the code snippet a little is creating a pointer of type class2 that is being passed to copyto tries to call a member function of the received pointer that has never been segmentation fault and the program if that did not kill the you are trying to from to which is just about doing if what you intend is casting the returned value from you must know that you cannot use on you must either change copyto signature to return class1 that you can later cast or use on the that either copy is a virtual function in class1 that is in fact executed in class2 and does create a class2 or the returned element will not be a but rather a name of the method copyto is confusing as it is not copying the argument but rather from the after all i still not know what you are asking where would you want to use stack you can pass an stack allocated element to a but returning a to an stack allocated element is again a segmentation the object will be destroyed when the function ends and the receiver will be left with a dangling if your question is more theoretical on whether you can use on a stack allocated you can that class2 inherits from class2 class1 c1 is a class1 reference to a class2 you update the post a comment in this answer so that i notice and can correct it

 simple bot detection method heard of for forms is the hidden input if you are trying to secure a form put a input in the form with an id that looks completely then use css in an external file to hide or if you are really setup something like jquery to hide the input box on page if you do this right i imagine it would be very hard for a bot to figure you know those bots have it in there nature to fill out everything on a page especially if you give your hidden input an id of something like	
 simple fact that resubmitting the form generates a duplicate transaction is you should have some sort of check to ensure each submit of form data is the page which would submit the form should be given a unique id that gets submitted with the the business logic should then be able to recognise that the form submitted has already been processed the unique id will be the so ignores the second still stop clients from clicking the back button or even going back and resubmitting the form if they think whatever it has been

 simple way to help remember the difference is that is more analogous method is not generic and accepts an argument of type and so when comparing to the operator you have to think about it as if the operand were cast to object implication is that will nearly always return some value for and regardless of type normal way to overload is to just return if is an unkown will just throw an exception if no comparison available for those

 simply create the application context from multiple xml config files based on for testing without a the context is created by using all the config files in each service we access the services via spring and thus the client uses an application context that is initialized via an xml config which defines the proxy beans that enable meanwhile the services are confgured by the same xml files as used by the test but the application context is now loaded by either the dispatcherservlet or an ejb or setup allows us to tailor the application context for each scenario without having to duplicate any information in configuration which keeps maintenance much there is no hard dependency between config files via since that is handled at the layer above that actually creates the comment on the ide support since we are not using it

 so often i see a question on so which forces me to spend half an hour editing a really bad wikipedia the article is now only moderately in the part that bears on your i wrote as computer a function or expression is said to have a in addition to producing a it also modifies some state or has an interaction with calling functions or the outside for a function might modify a global or a static modify one of its raise an write data to a display or read call other or launch in the presence of side a behavior depends on past that the order of evaluation because understanding an effectful program requires thinking about all possible side effects often make a program harder to effects are essential to enable a program to interact with the outside world other computers on but the degree to which side effects are used depends on the programming imperative programming is known for promiscuous use of side in functional side effects are rarely functional languages such as standard ml and scheme do not restrict side but it is customary for programmers to avoid the functional language haskell restricts side effects with a static type only a function that produces a result of io type can have side

 so that for your cpu you only use this type of assembly to to your languages eventually convert to instructions that are executed on real whether that is done fairly directly as with an assembler or through a high level of abstraction as with the tricky bit is actually getting the machine instructions to manipulate the hardware in ways that you want since one point of higher level languages is to shield you from the hardware like are designed with the intent to manipulate hardware directly and so they include keywords like volatile to prevent the compiler from otherwise optimizing away references to device these may be written and not read back so that the compiler thinks the value saved is never used or it may be necessary to read a device register though the value is never there are also miscellaneous instructions for such operations as enabling and disabling interrupts that an ordinary program will not may also require linker support so that memory locations memory mapped can be located at the correct addresses for device however some processors use distinct instructions for and there must be some facility for inserting them in the code so in many cases it may not be possible to access unless there is explicit language with most modern operating systems like windows and applications are run in virtual memory where program addresses do not match physical address and the programs are usually denied access to the code that tries to access hardware when the os has not granted it specific permissions will generate an return to the os and no longer

 socket you create a listening socket and then for each client that you get a normal stream socket that you can use to handle the the os manages the queue of incoming connections behind the processes cannot bind to the same port at the same time by wondering if a way any especially to launch multiple instances of a such that they all bind to the and so they effectively share the each process instance could then be single it would just block when accepting a new when a client one of the idle process instances would accept that would allow each process to have a very sharing nothing unless through explicit shared and the user would be able to adjust the processing bandwidth by starting more such a feature for those asking not use obviously threads are an but with multiple threads in a single all objects are shareable and great care has to be taken to ensure that objects are either not or are only visible to one thread at a or are absolutely and most popular languages and runtimes lack support for managing this starting a handful of identical worker you would get a concurrent system in which the is no making it much easier to build a correct and scalable there a way for multiple processes to share a listening

 software development is a set of values and formulated by a group of the industry leading figures in is a concrete software development methodology that can be traced back to 1995 and was created by two of the original signatories of agile scrum supports agile early approach to software project management usually referred to as implies a sequence of clearly defined steps necessary to complete any execute and then represents a very simple and above all convenient abstraction from the project management theorist point of when one stage follows another it is possible to define clear inputs and outputs for each isolate and identify techniques and tools that are most useful at every this is a clear example of reductionism in tackling project management keep splitting the whole into smaller bits until you get to understand each bit in isolation and then hopefully you will master the mechanics of their as soon as the waterfall abstraction was presented it started to firstly it turned out that process can not be clearly cut into often definition is still changed on what it seems to be organisation or even execution in the stages were allowed to overlap and theoreticians started drawing all sorts of diagrams there possible to see how the definition stage gradually runs out as execution starts picking up during the organisation again only in it is possible to accurately estimate during the planning stage how long it is going to take to develop a piece of in actual the estimates and other plans have to be tweaked right through the execution phase which gave birth to a string of complex yet not very meaningful methods as value chronic problems with the waterfall abstraction gave birth to a number of project management methods xp programming that despite many differences at the more detailed level use the same fundamental principles to tackle product development project is organised as a number of small iterations through the classic project stages execution and iteration aims at a relatively small yet semantically complete increment in product functionality or involvement throughout the every iteration goes through a separate definition and planning stage the time horizon for various estimation and planning activities is greatly it helps achieve greater hence make it easier to access measure value and costs increments help controlling the evaluate utility of the changes and keep users involved since there is always a fresh version of fully functioning it is also much easier to organise a number of teams working on a large project simultaneously when increments are kept this really helps tackling task user feedback is key to iterative since it helps the product evolve gradually in a right direction providing greater utility at the end as opposed to the uncertainly of user reaction that is natural to driven by the waterfall	
 solution add go every 100 or 150	
 solution depends on the gameplay going if the gameplay is the anim is driven by the if the anim length determines how long the in that latter is typically more flexible in a commercial production environment as the designer can just say need that death anim to be and it gets but when you have very precise rules in mind or a simulated system like animation may be there is no orthogonal and clean solution for the general thing that helps to keep it from getting messy is to consider game ai ai is typically implemented as some form of finite state possibly multiple state machines or layered in some most common division being a high level scripting format with low level the low level you can say things like the hitreact playback my hitreact anim until it then find out from the logic what state to continue at the high level there are a multitude of ways to go about defining the but simple repeating loops like are a good way to helps to keep the two kinds of behaviors the planned and the reactions to new events from being too it always work out that way in for the same reasons that sometimes you want code to drive data or the other way but ai for no general solutions

 some important concepts discussed here helped me to solve the memory leaking out in my there were two main allocation with of my types was when i changed it to leaking got even and because one my types had a constructor calling an external function with no parameters and no correct memory since i called that function after the there was no bug in the processing but only on memory so a correct constructor solved one of the main memory other leaking was related to a buggy which i was able to isolate with valgrind a bit a patience to get its output the bug call me a here it where an as i would avoid misprogramming just like i actually changed it to a or a coding yet because it is still not clear to me if a can pass them as parameter to other i still must be careful with memory leaking is gone

 sources of advice are correct when they say it is the domain in many it will be quite closely aligned your data model as the domain and data models differ is that the data model is relatively static in form whereas your domain model adds the specific constraints and rules of your for in my data model i represent blood pressure as smallints and in my i have a pressure object that holds values for each of the two readings and that also imposes additional restrictions on the range of acceptable values the range for systolic is much smaller than that for it also adds qualitative judgments on these values bp of is addition of these aspects of the problem domain is what makes the domain model more than just the data in some domains those that would be better rendered with a fully data model and that map poorly on the relational find that the two diverge quite all the systems created feature a very high degree of i often push a fair number of domain constraints into the data model itself via stored

 specific community extension for joomla is are also extensions problem will be to find a combination which does what you want to an acceptable your customer is not satisfied and has musts which the solution provide you will have to start hacking the extensions or start writing hacking a joomla installation is not really a good idea since upgrading will become hard and a not upgraded joomla installation is a great security the end you might be better of developing your own joomla extension which does what you need it to or refrain from using joomla at more extensions you use at the same the harder maintenance of hacked code will pros and cons in is definitely one of the best cms but it always depends on your what tools you two websites can help with the choice a page where you can over a 100 open source cms and similar basically an extremely large feature comparison matrix of almost 1000 cms and similar software all price own experience was a when typo3 was strong among free cms but that time is the interface is clunky and typo3 has fallen far behind in the then there was a time when mambo became strong and later joomla split from mambo and became even but the code legacy of the joomla series was strongly flawed and a new player quickly took the cleaner clearer node based maybe for some too hard to in the same time when drupal got strong and the joomla series had serious security stories about hacked installations piled up and drupal had the pole position for some joomla is a completely different it has a few fantastic new features and in every upgrade more and more code follows mvc and other nice together with the enormous wealth of extensions design joomla definitely offers more options than any other open source had several extrem cases which i would do custom development where only joomla was able to fullfill all the needs for a there are also a few new names which have a great silverstripe for

 sql you could do all sorts of fancy but google api is rather that you want all records to be no more than 1 minute just ask the database for all records less than 1 minute and then have python collate the results and reject the duplicate the data you show it looks like getting a couple of rows per per minute or so that approach should be sufficient even though its alternative would be to keep a second table with only the latest entry for each in it and cull that table every now and then to remove records over a minute

 standard library often has a similar feature set compared to the native library but there are several important is object whether you like it or the advantage of this is that certain concepts are easier to for most file related operations are found directly in the file compare this to where a file is a handle which is really just a an index into your open file the posix approach is very close to how the os actually implements but in java you see that or know it or has certain behaviours in certain there are many awt apis that are the way they are because awt needed to be identical on a number of separate that turned out to be and sun most of because supporting platform equally meant supporting every platform the newer implements almost everything in pure and thus is far better at and thus has a richer and that api is very different from the native windowing swing integrate too well because it uses so little of the native has certain limitations that the native libraries for you have function thus you have and and other java patterns for doing things that in would involve function so any api that needs one of these features will be significantly different in java than in the native in java often has libraries that offer similar behaviour to the native and sometimes offer completely different but best to think of java as a platform in its own sometimes you need advanced such as opengl or data in which case want a specific java api but most of the time you should evaluate java as its own

 stop custom formatter might only be slightly more efficient than the but you can add more features to your own implementation that would make it more did a similar thing in and here are some of the features i added just format the method accepts either a varargs array or a map be a so my format strings can look like f quick brown jumped over the if i already have my objects in a map is pretty i can call the format method like s i have a special syntax for performing regular expression replacements on strings during the formatting after calling all space characters in the object string are converted to f blah blah blah blah i have a special syntax that allows the formatted to check the argument for applying a different formatter depending on whether the object is null or f blah blah blah blah are a zillion other things you can one of the tasks on my todo list is to add a new syntax where you can automatically format and other collections by specifying a formatter to apply to each element as well as a string to insert between all something like wraps each elements in adjacent elements with a f blah blah blah blah the syntax is a little awkward and not in love with it the point is that your existing class might not be much more efficient than the framework but if you extend it to satisfy all of your personal you might end up with a very convenient library in the i use my own version of this library for dynamically constructing all sql error and localization enormously	
 storage to remember a node you can initialize it to 0 or some unknown walk the start at the root at both of the if your visited is equal to the right then step to the parent if the is equal to the left then step to the right else step to the left until finished walking the whole only real cleverness is using the one variable to remember where coming from in order to decide where to go this makes the traversal end up taking visit every middle node three and every leaf so still storage is

 tended to go with a method that retrieves the it simplifies testing and isolates the make it private if you want to an overloaded constructor can invoke the method if it makes when the participantid is option is to create the empty instance and delay loading all of the appropriate data until the first get invocation on any property that requires db at that time you can retrieve all of the data in one round trip to the database and populate the remainder of the if no one asks for details then saved the	
 tends to be a bad idea to make fields public because it then becomes hard to force error checking constraints add to value changes in the your you have a const so the above issues are not a the main downside of making it a public field is that locking down the underlying for if in the future you wanted to change the internal representation to a or a unicode or something then break all the client with a you could convert to the legacy representation for existing clients while providing the newer functionality to new users via a new still suggest having a getter method like the one you have placed this will maximize your future	
 term can not only refer to no native but also refer to how data operations are from platform to platform there are subtile for example in the least significant digits of floating point numbers due to diffrent hardware implementations of the floating point could also mean that such diffrences are removed and every single instruction returns bit by bit the same result on every ad hoc this prohibts the usage of some hardware and would require i am not sure if thi is feasible at acceptable costs or if there is a good trick to achiev	
 term is but in my internationalization we typically avoided the term character to refer to we used the term only for legacy encoding schemes that had one or more bytes to define each character encodings that require only one byte per along with chinese encodings are typically of the legacy with some require a sort of state machine model more a page swapping to and moving backwards in a text stream is complicated and and do not suffer from this as can be tested with a bitmask and can be tested against a range of surrogate so moving backward and forward in a document can be done safely without major few legacy for languages like thai and have some of the complexity of multibyte character sets but are really just built on combining and generally lumped in with the broad term

 that and paste is not actually despite the the act of is figuring out how something should and what code is needed to make that when you copy and paste some it is someone else who did the this a bad thing as you always need to write code but to call yourself a you do need to have written the code will want to start try to write a large complex application as your first step into there is a good reason why most people who are taught programming are first taught how to print this is because there is a lot more that you will need to know than just what code to use you need to know where code execution starts and how it and that sort of you need to be able to look at the code and step through it knowing where program execution will go so you understand how it will a tutorial or course in there is so much free stuff do not trust any tutorial that just gives you large chunks of make sure it forces you to actually come up with some code do exercises such as sorting calculating fibonacci and the and or the learn about conditional statements and the loop and play with these to do various or forms programming is more make sure you know the fundamentals of the language before you go looking through any api or framework documentation to see what the language can need to know how execution how to write what types of variables you can use etc before you can effectively use an api or framework it is boring not being able to do cool graphics or forms and sticking to basic text or number but you have to walk before make sure you are not just when you learn about something new like the array the try it by actually doing a lot faster than just reading a book or website and you may be more likely to remember books about some people say you should learn c before you learn anything i necessarily but if you do learn c then the book to read is c programming by kernighan and many programming books are very interesting but either not suitable for or going to teach you how to actually begin this one is an a decent text editor with syntax highlighting and line all you should a big ide that also does code completion and the like is not necessarily helpful at the learning spend too long choosing one or setting it if you already have just get on and be done with if you like it you can change it once you get more or if already paid for microsoft visual studio then use but go out and get it just for the sake of learning a avoid falling into the trap of spending all your time sharpening your tools and no time using

 that this is for a you probably care about a lookup table is definitely the fastest but you trade accuracy for speed with this so how accurate must you be to meet only you can answer before you trade determine first if you have a speed all of the trigonometric functions are calculated using numerical methods numerical analysis to learn some trig functions are have more expensive methods than others because they rely on series that converge more slowly and who your computer may have different implementations for these functions than another at any you can find out for yourself how expensive these functions are by writing some small programs that loop through as many iterations as you with increments of your all the while timing the then you can pick the fastest

 the algorithm that is the since you probably care about doing this in real generally for smaller blocks of the algorithms compress about the same or take a few mostly because the algorithms need to transmit the dictionary or huffman trees in addition to the highly recommend deflate by zlib and for a number of the algorithm is quite well bsd and is the only compression required to be supported by zip per the infozip aside from the when it determines that the compression is larger than the decompressed a store mode which only adds 5 bytes for every block of data block is 64k aside from the store deflate supports two different types of huffman tables dynamic and a dynamic table means the huffman tree is transmitted as part of the compressed data and is the most flexible varying types of nonrandom the advantage of a fixed table is that the table is known by all decoders and thus need to be contained in the compressed the decompression code is relatively written both java and javascript versions based directly off of zlib and they perform rather other compression algorithms mentioned have their i prefer deflate because of its runtime performance on both the compression step and particularly in decompression point of zip is not a compression it is a for doing packet i would bypass zip and just use the apis provided by

 the best way of implementing this kind of sorting suggest using the library implementation of with the distance to the target string as the sorting of course not a helpful why because what you really want to know is a good difference metric for answer to the qusetion it depends on which properties of the distance you care being read up on the levenstein distance and what it really says about the can modify the basic algorithm to skew the metric in favor of identical characters occurring in long runs by fiddling with the weighting of different steps in the dynamic programming can also use the soundex which says something about which strings sound similar that works best for short i know what kind of input you the strings are of equal you can also use the hamming distance the number of indexes where the strings that can probably be generalized to by counting indexes as always which gives you something short it given some but i say which is going to be a good decision without some more information from

 the biggest problems with anonymous types stem from the inability to name their that not possible to expilictly specify the type of an anonymous type as an expression in this really makes in awkward to do things like create a generic list new way to specify an ananymous you have to resort to a helper return new list also has a larger impact in that you use an anonymous type as a return makes casting extremely awkward a helper etc these are not the operations that anonymous types were designed in many ways they are designed to used within a particular defined function and subsequently created lambda not as a data communication type between to full fledged this is certainly a limitation in the design and at times drives me but overall i find them to be a very useful construct in the parts of linq would not be possible without them in some

 the code first is natural when trying to figure out how your code is going to writing the test first helps you determine what your code show do how it should do if writing the code trying to solve the problem without completely defining the this necessarily but you are using unit tests as a regression tool rather than a development tool not just not	
 the code implementing the registerclass mechanism is hidden in classes implementation you need this for getting the list of components installed in the you can write a design install it into the ide and use iotapackageservices in toolsapi this will give you the list of installed packages and their have to add to your clause to be able to use internal units like bit more work but a more generic way would be to enumerate all loaded you can call getpackageinfo on a package module to enumerate contained unit names and required however this will not give you a list of classes contained in the could enumerate the list of exported functions with tjclpeimage in the and search for those named like calling getprocaddress with the function name you get the tclass from there you can walk the hierarchy using this way you can enumerate all classes in all packages loaded in a process running a delphi executable compiled with runtime packages

 the compiler checks whether the arguments satisfy the constraints set by the for unsigned int t for int i i char int float not defined for this you could create a define for it and use it as a parameter for a template parameter is valid if and only if it satisfies the constraints defined by the this is very but results in long compilation times a type satisfies the constraints must be checked every time the template is instead of checking the validity of every particular which results in longer compile times and is error you declare explicitly that the arguments must implement a particular interface set of properties and inside the you call any methods but only those supported by that every time you instantiate a the runtime have to check whether the argument satisfies a long set of but only whether it implements the specified of this is less but less error where t void a int bool b implements the methods and properties defined in b explicitly implement	
 the compiler translate a call to to be the same as copying and pasting the difference could be profound or simply but what doing is assigning the value from to whether the type is a value type or a reference type will determine exactly what happens and what will happen if you manipulate that but not creating a function pointer or delegate in doing it will have an effect on performance really something that can be answered other than to say that it have a negative we say if it will have a positive since that would depend on what actually happens when you call if an expensive then this could make it but the downside would be that any differences in value upon subsequent calls to be reflected if you cached its value in

 the dark ages before there was a common pattern i used in my code which was to define a struct with a set of function pointers that operated on that struct in some way and provided particular behaviors for in i was just building a the difference was that i could the struct at runtime to change behaviors of individual objects on the fly as this offers a much richer model of inheritance at the cost of stability and ease of the greatest was that there was exactly one person who could write this code used this heavily in a ui framework that let me change the way objects got who was the target of and so on the fly something that very few uis this process formalized in oo languages is better in every meaningful

 the entity framework is really limited in terms of what kind of many to many relationships it can the only thing that the visual studio designer will recognize is a table consisting of only two both foreign keys to the other two and where the primary key is a compound key on both of the foreign if you have control of your database one thing you could do is change your table to drop the column and make the primary key a compound key on and if you do then when you map the tables the entity framework will recognize this as a many to many you do that you have control of the database then you will need to make sure that the only fields that you map in your edmx are the fields which relate to the other and that you do not map the primary this is because the mapping wizard will discard and the storage mapping every time you option would be to not use a many to many mapping in the entity framework and instead just treat the relationship as another entity instead of having it subsumed into the remember if this has been improved in the forthcoming

 the following result1 result2 should always equal result2 the thing it result1 is and result2 is the only difference is the order of the know that doubles are implemented in such a way that rounding issues can aware that i can use decimals instead if i need absolute or that i can use in my if just a nerd who wants to understand what the compiler is can anyone tell to everyone so far suggested reading up on floating point arithmetic talked about the inherent inaccuracy of how the cpu handles but i feel the main thrust of my question is still which is my fault for not phrasing it let me put it like down the above i would expect the following operations to be r1 r2 r3 r4 assume that each of the above additions had a rounding error so r1 contains rounding error r2 includes rounding errors e1 r3 contains e3 and r4 contains e3 i know how exactly how the rounding errors happen but i would have expected to equal clearly it but that seems somehow wrong to another thing is that when i run the above i get any rounding what makes me think the compiler doing something weird rather than the know asking a lot and maybe the best answer anyone can give is to go and do a phd in cpu but i just thought at the il from my original code clear that the compiler not the cpu doing private hidebysig static void cil init float64 float64 nop ret compiler is adding up the numbers for does the order affect the rounding when adding multiple doubles in

 the intel software developers manual it says that interrupt vectors are usually user defined for external io in my systems programming class i must develop a simple device my question is how can i define a specific interrupt vector to be used for a specific is this done with the we are developing a simple operating system so my situation is quite in the end i need to understand how this all happens on an x86 currently our system is set up so that a few interrupt vectors above 32 are assigned to devices like a serial port and in reading the datasheet for the intel 82801eb ich5 io specifically the section concerning the 8259 it says that irq15 is the secondary ide how would that eventually be put on the stack as a interrupt may just be so confused that this question make so i apologize in so our systems programming class has a very simple which has kernel routines for installing isrs to handle specific interrupts given the vector in our class last quarter the professor gave us a header file that defined the keyboard as vector number 0x2c or something i am trying to find out how to map the primary secondary ide channel interrupts to various isrs using our kernel for all of the unused interrupt vectors have a default handler that would print messages if an interrupt so ide interrupts even on at the however that is another do i identify device specific interrupts on

 the is textmate 2 still in or has it been is being actively if this text is still that is still the updated april allan stresses that no release is the allan has updated the textmate blog with on the past two posts on this blog have slowed to just a and a number of textmate users have asked about or publicly worried about its this blog the first written here in a long is an attempt to assuage those concerns and answer some of the most frequent textmate development is going textmate 2 done but progress is it is starting to take and the end is in the rewrite has been a slow and careful but the ideas behind it are i hope to publicly describe some new abstractions in the coming weeks and the community continues to churn out new bundles and features for textmate and been building up a backlog of posts describing while i am not writing to announce a release date for textmate i do hope that this post will be the first in a series showing a bit more requests for textmate 1 have mostly been incremental additions such as split chunked and editing over but textmate 2 is about more than new surface every part has been completely rewritten to take advantage of the lessons learned from the years of version not only are the data structures chosen for increased but the abstractions on which textmate is language been rethought and are more powerful than in the coming try to describe some of these new but for know that i am excited about the new ideas where does development stand for it feels to me like most of the modules are getting say but as they on the mountains look while i use for my own and the basic infrastructure is pretty much of the still needs and for now all lacking the spit and polish of a finished hopefully an alpha version will be ready before too but i make any promises about why i been better about keeping the world it is a combination of many things but the main issue is that i am not good at writing for a large i am more into informal for instance over mailing lists or on so while i started a lot of i end up unhappy with them halfway and they get finished or i am taking i have enlisted a technical writer to help bring this blog back to and try to communicate more of status and direction through than either of those problems as i is that textmate 2 is no minor a major undertaking with a long timeline and its final form fully i want to hype and i want to get hopes up before i know i can meet their i wanted to throw ideas onto the internet without having a chance to implement them humbled that textmate has served as inspiration for many other and i hope that it continues to be a model for other developers in the but i want to see my ideas done my way before i feed them to the am trying to slowly turn this with this i hopefully am showing that a hand is at the i know been quiet too long about my i make up for but going i aim to do the official blog saying the public alpha version will be release before christmas

 the last element to will terminate the string but it fix the damage that was done when the function wrote outside the in that case you only hide a and the program might produce wrong results or crash later in a totally unrelated function call or on my it would be better to detect if the function wrote outside of buffer and crash the program if it that makes finding and thus fixing the error to achieve that you could set the last byte of the buffer to before calling the function and test if that is still the case when the function as bill forster already always a good idea to also pass the buffer length to the called	
 the least would be to do the processing in tsql at the db but that may not be a good idea on the you want to do the processing in you should probably host a wcf or asmx service in a such as iis and add a service reference between your client app and the the service does the call to the database and the and returns the this is quite a bit of can also host wcf in a windows service even a console which might make life easier

 the library that generated the xml used a relative url for the dtd rather than a fully qualified as such the xmldocument is using an class to convert the relative path to a fully qualified by default it uses an is a concrete this will try to map the location of the dtd to a location it thinks is relative to the xml trouble where is the probably in memory which is not relative to anything and the xmlurlresolver is using the process location instead which in your case is visual studio which is located at visual studio what can you well i suppose you have to crate you own xmlresolver that inherits from xmlurlresolver an overrides the resolveuri method and does something having done that you will have an xmlreadersettings class and set the xmlreolver property to the class you just an xmlreader using passing in your document and the xmlsettings an xmldocument and call load passing in the xmlreader and the xmldocument property of your xmlcontrol to the that is all a bit of a so if it where me i would just use to remove the dtd declaration from the document before processing it into you are feeling really brave you can create a resolver that inherits directly from once you have done that you can override the method and then you can get the dtd document from wherever you i wrote one once that got dtds from files embedded as resource but i have the code any more

 the most practical way to add custom properties to a side wide assume a simple actionresult return first thing that comes to mind is a custom class and using in a application base class customdatadictionary public string title class applicationcontroller public new customdatadictionary viewdata assuming you would also have to also make a corresponding customviewpage with the same property to use the custom view data dictionary in the views as second thing that comes to mind is to create a viewdatadictionaryextensions use a my beef with view models are that always creating one and passing it into view seems like repeating yourself over and over in controller at least compared to the previous two real goal is that each application might have a core set of properties in the viewdata that make sense for that apps i tend to shy away from relying on dictionary and it would be nice to have real properties for other developers to rely one to know what data to keys can easily be three methods get the job what have others way to

 the original answer below is really dealing in terms of if the sequences are short all the calls through building a etc will actually be more expensive than using in that case both calls will be really pretty quick other definitely scales better as the two sequences get but for if absolutely that the sequences are the nested loop solution will be will be faster than the solution but as casperone will be faster than because it will exit as soon as it sees an sequences of length n and intersect will be whereas the solution is builds up a from the sequence takes and then loops through the outer sequence takes yielding any element which is in the these results are streamed the inner sequence will be evaluated when the first element is requested from but this only goes as far as finding the first match using have an if there are any so we need to take the overall number of matches into consideration when working out the results from linq rocks well worth getting your head round well as deferred

 the past six been using nhibernate with active record at and lightspeed at home in my spare found both lightspeed and nhibernate with active record to be straightforward to found drawbacks with lightspeed the features i like most over this saves a lot of time and provides consistent model class and config for linq and mysql features i like most about active record xml configuration the most common configuration options are provided flexibility is still available when required criteria drawbacks of active record for me appear to be more ruby on rails code examples than compared both products side by side and run performance tests on both would guess that nhibernate suffers from a deeper class while optimising my code using ants i found that for a simple query there is call after call through nhibernate classes before the actual sql query is the query that is produced that will make all the difference to the ultimate performance of the lightspeed and nhibernate offer lazy and active record makes this easy for think it is easier to optimise your queries using lightspeed with and more clear to people maintaining your whereas not usually recommended to write nhibernate

 the previous answer below for it depends on the implementation of the but under the current ms this actually only creates a single instance which is reused for every able to do that because delegates are immutable and that delegate require any information from the know whether this was the case with you can decompile your code and see whether the il actually uses a cached field or using the answer below is a safe way to only create one instance it creates an instance of a that will take some you could reduce that static class public static readonly eventhandler empty delegate sealed class public event eventhandler loggingin that point just be the one and you can refer to it from the downside is that other classes could then unsubscribe using the same if you trust the rest of your codebase not to do this is probably the best bet from a memory point of

 the same hash code does not mean the object instances are the an easy way to check whether they are actually the same instance is to set a breakpoint in your constructor and evaluate this expression in the watch they are exactly the same object and that is your i think it far more likely that you are creating multiple each of which imports the same through spring per the the default scope for an object is what you really want is for spring to create a new instance of the button for each control that needs your configuration should look more like having said all i think be far better off using an mvvm you could have spring provide the view model instances can be shared without and generate the ui off that

 there anyway i can have my application tell how much memory the user has and if the application is getting close to taking up a high percentage of possible some of the other but going to be very unlikely that your application really needs to what is it that doing where you think you need to be this sensitive to memory how do you know how much memory the machine gives to video etc this be possible using wmi but the bigger question is why do you need to do if you have 4gb of how much actual memory is given to can you configure this a configurable when a application starts up the operating system allocates a block of memory for it to this is handled by the os and there is no way to configure the algorithms used to determine the amount of memory to there is no way to configure how much of that memory the runtime uses for the managed large object

 there are a couple ways to approach i would probably just use which should work just fine for your purposes long as the map is from rather than if you want to go through some it is possible to give a type for trait val class extends class extends class extends assuming that you were reading the json field into a scala field named you would give that field the following time you pull a field out of you would need to pattern checking whether the value was of type or two of once you have the inner you would then pattern match on to determine whether it represents an or you have to do this sort of pattern matching anyway in order to use the data once you pull it out of the advantage to the approach is the compiler will check you to ensure that you missed any the disadvantage is that you just skip impossibilities mapping to an there is some overhead imposed by all of these wrapper so watch out for that scala does allow you to define a type alias which should cut down on the amount of loc required for a few implicit conversions to make the api and you should be all nice and	
 there are arguments for favor of nonmember offers allows better code reuse can be reused for container because a free if it had been a ever container would have to define its makes a lot of generic programming tricks is not valid if is an that makes it a bit more awkward to write generic code working on but can be made valid for any even ones like it can also make mixins through composition a lot because it require the user to yourself through members to get to the mixin object you want to operate favor of making things member functions java and and in a lot of member functions are synonymous with that argument should not be code readability is and if people find it easier to read the member a strong argument in its it just produce better from a strict point of nonmembers should be preferred when	
 there are limited strategies for automating memory allocation and deallocation in the compiler generates a lot of code behind the scenes for you it keeps track of each variable on the stack and makes sure that the appropriate destructor is called when the stack is cleaned this is actually a fairly sophisticated type of code especially when you throw exceptions into the on the other hand is much which is why sometimes called level assembly c have any mechanism to guarantee that a particular bit of code is called when a function exits or a variable is popped off the so up to you to keep track of each bit of memory you allocate and every file or network socket you open and clean them up at the appropriate no practical way to build an automatic smart pointer in concept you should look at is rather that try to keep track of every individual block of memory you you create a do some chunk of placing every memory block you allocate into the then free the whole pool when you trade off a little bit of performance and control here in order to ease the cognitive load on the but most of the time well worth should take a peek at the apache portable runtime they have a memory pool library at if apr is too much for you to dive you can implement a very simple memory pool using three functions and a linked list data pseudocode would be something pool struct pool pool allocate a pool and return it pool void create a new pool node and push it onto the list pool walk the free each memory block then free its node the pool is something like struct pool pool is empty pool full of clean it up and make a new one pool new pool is empty return	
 there are ways to add completely disparate you might want to think about the scope of these added are they going to be related to your main class could argue that if they they be part of they have enough in common to warrant adding features you can look for something like the decorator pattern it lets you bypass some of the wonky issues with doing things like

 there but it is not easy and may not be worth your way of doing it is to create your own buildprovider and replace the default with it in the config would also create your own most likely inherited from the the buildprovider is responsible for supplying the in most primitive situation you could overwrite the parsefile read the aspx process create a copy and pass it to the base all aspx parsing code is sealed and internal to ms so you rewriting it would mean building entire compilation alternative method is to create your own page builder and put it in the the drawback is that you get an easy access to literals your spaces of the first level to get to inner controls and their you have to either hack the parser using reflection or manipulate the code this way you would get properly built files and temporary is a simplified public partial class is builder of the public class mypagebuilder is where strip white but only of top as between the head and or form and the end of public override void replace some white spaces with you can manipulate the entire generated code using public override void you can the pageparser here using the field at this point is so it be public override void controlbuilder type string string fieldinfo fi string s my it is not worth the

 there is no easy way to determine if a pointer is does have these functions are inherently flawed they only determine if a function is readable or writable in your address space at the moment of the they can also be the cause of and should never be main issue is that there is no way to differentiate between a pointer that is still accessible to your and a good return off by is probably a valid pointer in your and might be pointing to be able to access it without crashing but writing to it will corrupt your

 there really are a lot of methods you need to you could cut down on the code using a by creating just one method to do the calling and exception and passing in the name of the to as an still have the same amount of but the code would be simpler and already know the name of the method that depending on the type of exception object that they throw it may contain stack information or you could use another library to walk the stack trace to get the name of the last method that it failed this depends on the platform	
 there something in the redirecting you to piece of a meta	
 there something specific in that requires you to pass a class reference as and why are you also returning classa as well that seems to be redundent if you are using ref to begin	
 there something that be accomplished without they are absolutely equivalent to defining the class normally at top and then copying a reference to it into the outer think any special reason nested classes are other than it makes no particular sense to explicitly them looking for a class that exists within the lifecycle of the and always has a reference to an instance of the outer classes as java does nested classes are not that but you can hack up something that for making inner adds a property to the inner pointing to the owner use a weakref dict to memoise previous results so always returns the same inner def not consider adding a def if instance is return if instance not in return using an inner class def return inner object of inner object of object at uses class which are new in python and otherwise have to say after the class	
 there will be performance differences between your introduces a for message processing introduces locking contention because need to synchronize access to your shared is starting to go in the right though a queue for each message type is a little probably recommend starting with a queue for each model in your app and adding queues where it makes since to do so for improved you like option it sounds like you would be interested in implementing a it is going to take some reading to understand what is going but i think the architecture fits well with your line of is a good hybrid	
 theres already something like this listofints new	
 these apps have switches to make them start then you can easily use i be but i highly doubt this is you would have to have some way to interface with the windows window which is inherently very and java is therefore unlikely to include always possible that someone has written a library to handle the task but it just seem likely to	
 these look up the values of various not sure exactly what trying to but if you need to translate a symbol to a string use if you want to look up all the possible identifiers it would depend on what looking show a list of instance methods an object has show a list of instance variables an object has show a list of class level constants get the most mileage out of these methods when debugging or trying out new the only reason probably use these in production code is to output some kind of automatic string representation of an

 thing i like about postgresql over mysql is that it has a slightly more open licensing	
 thing i would do is check your employment you may not have touched the project from was a good move by the many employment contracts border on the draconian and they may own the rights to what you do in your free particularly in this case where what doing has commonality with your they may even argue that the backup solution is directly or indirectly a product of what you do for them so they have a claim to the rights a portion rights they do have and whether any employment contract terms are enforceable of contracts get pushed on employees that are basically is something you need to speak to a lawyer you want to take it that far get them to stipulate in written form email will that this was done in your own not as a product of your employment and that your demonstration is just any discussion about use of the product and licensing is deferred but you reserve the right to grant a license or you might not get all that but get as much of it as possible before the if there is someone sympathetic in management you can speak to just say that you touched this from work and just worried about maintaining control over your free time

 thing to be aware of is that a dicom is not necessarily just image the dicom file format contains much more than raw image this may be where getting hung consider checking out the dicom file standard which you should be able to find linked on the wikipedia article for this should help you figure out how to parse out the information actually interested	
 thing to keep in mind about recaptcha is that they are images actually scanned from real books and as such you have to be aware that funky punctuation and stuff can make it not just for example seen partial words that end in a hyphen obviously occurred on the end of a as well as numbers find if you bear in mind the origin it makes a heck of a lot more sense and is easier to you only need to get one of the recaptcha words because the other is used to aid in the however you know which is	
 thing to notice is that if your would benefit of a functional programming language like may yield speedups of a totally different magnitude than the theretically optimal code just by not evaluating unnecessary if you are talking about the monetary benefit of better forget to add the cost of maintaing your software into the	
 thing to remember is that at core visual like any is a glorified text editor with an integrated and maybe a few other features as you could certainly use visual studio 2005 to input the code text of your linq program and then use the command line compiler to build you might even be able to find or write an to automate the build means the technically correct answer to your question you get extra ide syntax to work with solution debugger result is that you would probably be better served if i had simply you already have 2005 but not you have a few the 2008 express a tool like a 2008 full	
 thing to try is to create a new team project logged in to the tfs server using the account that you used to install tfs that still work then sounds like you might possibly have your sharepoint admin url set incorrectly in thing you might want to try if the best practices which comes with the 2008 power and will point out common configuration might also want to try the configureconnections command to see if you can see anything	
 thing you can do is to trap for the esc only your main screen is in the screen stack the esc key is you can then clean up your you can register a systemlistener to listen for callbacks to kill threads or clean up is also a good place to clean stuff when your app is

 things in square brackets are called and appear often in they appear here to have the same as this is not strictly it has microsoft extensions to allow integration with the you declare such a struct in c or this does not guarantee a particular memory to control you need special pragmas to control these are platform so what seeing here is just the clr equivalent of that example is from the documentation for an older version of cli integration for which was called managed it was abandoned very quickly and replaced in the next version by a grafting of cli features into that is so complete and it effectively becomes a different language just as is a different language from

 think a algorithm would remove the possibility that the benchmark is biased through ignorance or to favor one it is very difficult to write a complex program in two different languages exactly the testing something like the efficiency of a multithreaded application in vs for would require developers skilled in multithreaded development both and there would still be questions as to whether the benchmark app properly represents the general or if it is misrepresenting a special case that only one language handles	
 think a for there are different use example if i store a tree with a program installed locally in i may want to symlink to some specific config without an absolute that when i move the whole tree to the link to the config file stays the other if i want to reference some global file in in a local i will do it with an absolute path that guarantees that pointing to the same file anywhere i think what do you want to and the relative absolute path decision will be either or only do rule is never link to anything in root dir via	
 think a lot for me to learn about data this result gives zero should be wrong with this	
 think a lot of languages out there will allocate the entire array as a block up you may need to use a wrapper class that provides this in the absence of a language java and for will be a contiguous block of have to allocate a new block and copy the old or use a wrapper that manages this for either doing the same thing or using pointers to that would be arraylist or similar in

 think both are good languages with coherent and concise design and both would be a great choice as a first language to learn some other commonly suggested being i feel that either of these make for a great web development language they both have several drawbacks for that will probably use inside which is a mess that will not allow you to learn neither good general programming skills nor good web programming skills i do believe the skill sets do not overlap all that as a web development platform is also bound tightly to microsoft technologies and i have my issues with ruby you will probably use ruby on rails which is a great mvc framework for web development but it has its own issues and is also very unlike current web development techniques as they are used in it is also rather you want to learn general programming and design some desktop or server either would be a great choice though i will recommend you want to learn web then i suggest going with a more industry standard and also not a really bad language which is java using if you only plan on ever using one tool and be done with then either are good choices and i would recommend ruby on my answer above is relevant if you want to be a good programmer and use this experience as a base for learning other	
 think by the most fun and exciting platform to develop even though i am not a huge fan of its api is full featured and quite easy to appstore behind makes it the most compelling platform to work despite all the bad rep apple has for its unclear approvement documentation is very too old and almost unsupported by complete lack of good development documentation is very i like windows in my visual studio is the best ide you can use to and what you use when you develop for windows having said windows mobile really rocks for formbased but for general purpose is still behind documentation is very i like very but even though i like eclipse for java not that great for mobile its simulator is too i used it that much documentation is quite having behind is the most difficult but it has the biggest installed base so it be ignored by any tools that great and neither is java easy to use as long as you mess with protected api app will need special approvement from rim to use if you take into consideration java based i like android but installed based makes it difficult to ignore this only for low end

 think generally most that do a lot of work the can cause a lot of no problem using a gridview if that layout is what you want but it very rarely and a repeater is probably a better updatepanels can save you lots of work if you want an ajaxy feel to your but compared with a jquery ajax call they sorry to say so the user wizard you mention can be really useful during but if membership functionality is required in the project it should be built as an integrated part of in proffessional programmers should do the job themselves and write code that specifically satisfies their clients and only take in ready made parts of the framework when that is in fact exactly what they

 think i figured it out some code elsewhere in the app uses xml functions such functions are likely executing in another thread at the same time i am executing the code fragment i nsxmlparser obviously uses the same functions under the added a synchronized block to the other code using the same lock object as the one i use for my nsxmlparser and the crashes seem to have gone so i guess the lesson here is that these xml functions are totally not use with	
 think i figured it the namespaces are more important than i it works if i set for each class being i have some more work to do with the linq but on the right only thing that gets me is that there was no reference to the namespace in the xslt	
 think i found a solution that feel free to chime in if any of you have a better my button i placed the following onclientclick event calls my fadeout method below which returns false if the current content is faded in and returning false cancels altogether the asynchronous postback that the updatepanel would have the animation is done i set the isfadedin variable to false and click the button again know that the code to click the button is not cross browser compatible right this is just a proof of concept so that piece of it will need to be since isfadedin is set to this time the fadeout method does not return a false and so the updatepanel performs the got an event handler attached to the pageloaded event so that i can fade the new content in once it is done i can now finish my animations before loading the new i have to wait for the animation to finish before starting the postback so users actually have to wait a little opacity isfadedin if if opacity opacity else isfadedin if if opacity opacity else isfadedin return

 think i would split by close then split by be the easiest way to write the code depending on your point of but not the most efficient in terms of most efficient would just be to walk through the performing different actions when you find a comma or arrayofarrays new masterindex new for char c in if c new else if c append num to else if c is append c to	
 think if you are looking at creating a website with such a strict be better off trying to use a cms such as or a host of other ones out there that are most not are open source meaning you can do development on your own to expand or modify the

 think is absolutely spot however like to add the following a meaningful error message is useful for logging and exception an exception thrown by the bcl is less likely to describe the specific circumstances of the exception wrt your perhaps this is less of an issue with null checks which of the necessarily give you much information was passed a null no idea is pretty much the best you can do most of the however sometimes you can provide more information and obviously this is more likely to be relevant when dealing with other exception null check clearly demonstrates to other developers and a form of you come back to the code a year that possible someone might pass a and it would be problematic if they did on excellent point you might do something before the null gets picked up i think it is vitally important to engage in checking for an exception before running other code is a form of defensive programming as you are taking into account things might not work the way you expected changes might be made in the future that you and ensuring that no matter what happens your null check such problems cannot a form of runtime that your parameter is not you can proceed on the assumption that it above assumption can result in slimmer you write the rest of your code knowing the parameter is not cutting down on extraneous subsequent null

 think it would be more correct to say that the question of whether the strategies must be deterministically identical is outside the scope of the definition of the strategy a function always returns the same result for given it is if two functions are deterministic and they always return the same value for the same inputs then they are deterministically they may or may not have the same side if they do then they are just plain this is not the let us consider an example that appears to require deterministic you might think that if two comparer implementations fail to return the same result for the same inputs then at least one of them must be but this is not necessarily the orders vary between some places sort some put mcduck with and so these are this is a perfect application of strategy and the strategies are most certainly deterministically	
 think its because the two machines usually would need to be optimized in different other than that i have no we run all our applications with the on the same machine granted not public facing but had no imagine that too many people care about one machine being compromised over both since the web application will usually have nearly unrestricted access to at the very least the data if not the schema inside the in what others might

 think meant that you should strip processing the so that you can write the xslt as you would for a normalized what assumes that the multiple body tags have no content between this would not remove the content of the body note that be removing anything from a body tag to an this would leave in place the initial and final in other words with input like good more good be targeting those two tags in the removing these would yield a continuous good more good

 think of a reason why float would be better than make sense if either worried about copies being made is irrelevant with a primitive type like or you want to be able to update a value across all instances that share the reference is irrelevant with top of references in members are a huge pain in the when it comes to and so have to offer a significant advantage of the alternatives in order to be and clearly not the case with the on is always amusing and thought	
 think one of the problems that having is that you are somewhere between not giving you enough knobs and but the problem complicated enough for you to write something more this reach for something like it more event driven so it can walk across your xml and give you control when you want once you get the element you you can do whatever you like with things like various things like xpath and so on can be useful in the same they are built to look deep into xml to pull out parts of unlike which just gives you a data d	
 think option 2 is the having each thread doing independant tasks would give you best 3rd approach can cause more delays if multiple threads are doing some operation like disk reading common sockets and so to use windows messaging framework for processing requests depends on the work load each thread would i think windows restricts the of messages that can be queued at the most to for most of the cases this should not be an but if you have lots of messages to be queued this might be some thing to take into queue gives a better control in a sense that you may reorder it the way you want be depending on

 think setting commits on a timed schedule is a particularly good especially if you start getting into testing and continuous committing at set intervals will break the build because there is no guarantee that you will have completed the changeset in the time better if you want to is to make the commit part of the build process just make the last step of the build process a commit to the that if the build you commit possible with all flavors of make and i know visual studio has pre and post build events that can be set to do something like so pretty sure that most modern ides can handle a special consideration for this problem in the commit hook to the beginning of the process so you can track when you mess up royally as well and how you come to fix the	
 think shane d has a reason which is quite as even i came across the same situation for a table having around 40 data for these columns is uploaded through csvs and used only for reporting purpose and a set of columns to process those are frequently if we maintain one table as a we perform frequent updates on that table and will be updating only 5 columns of feel every update disturbs the row allocation and there is highly possibility of so to avoid i followed the approach of separating data based on me know if any better

 think that a good way to answer this question would to approach it from the other what practices make xslt and of the things that seen that result in ineffective of said saying it i find that is often a sign of the developer trying to employ traditional programming techniques in a declarative a lot of bad xslt seen exists purely because the developer understand axis and and so he implemented logic using xslt constructs you can sometimes eliminate an amount of xslt by providing your transform with for an xml document contains data that has to be parsed using xslt string often much simpler to do all of the parsing outside of xslt and either add the parsed results to the xml or pass the parsed results as an argument to the seen some remarkably unmaintainable xslt implementing business logic that would be trivial to implement in or biggest problem that running into in my own xslt world have several line transforms that is dead certain that there are templates in my transforms that will never be used because the conditions testing for will never arise no way to determine programmatically if something like is alive or because contingent on something that metadata tell

 think that resource but common sense would seem to dictate that using 1 timer is probably better than like your timer is set to fire 100 times per which seems a bit do you animate each sprite at every timer might want to try firing times per second instead maybe even might want to look into the built in view animation functions as seems like they would probably work very well for what you are

 think their explanation sums it primary reason we created fan to write software that can run on both the java vm and the the reality is that many organizations are committed to one the other of these look better than all other in the absence of any information about them blog is just an error i see no reason why they would necessarily get this righter than language starts out fairly elegant for the set of things it was designed for i see some awkwardness in the little fan code i looked at just the real question is how well it scales to completely new and we simply know that if your organization has a rule that must run on our then it may be an acceptable compromise for giving up an awful lot just for vm for yours is the first fan question here on so a couple of fewer than what problem is fan the best python and ruby can already run on both vms have big communities and big and seem to be about the same level of but are far more	
 think there are events called onrefresh or you can know when the page is but knowing why where the user is going is outside security the only way to know whether the page has been reloaded is to know where the user was on the last page which is also outside the scope of you can sometimes get that via but it relies on the security settings to permit access to that

 think there is a point where you must draw a line and make a see no way to completely decouple logging from the system because you have to send those messages somewhere and in a way that someone would go with the default logging the default well documented and comes with the default so no dependency issues you save yourself from reinventing the if you are really into doing something you could make a global reporter you can instantiate and configure it at the beginning of your process no redirecting even in a per and call it from no need to pass it around in a multi threaded but that would be can also put it inside another thread and catch log events a la

 think this is more a preference i am big fan of keeping things simple and for this reason i would suggest you break out your operations into separate stored will be more transparent and also aide any performance tuning you may have to do in if your update is performing you can immediately isolate it as the cause whereas if the logic is part of a much larger procedure with varying crud the root cause of the issue will not be quite so

 think too early to say whether symbian going will be a good or bad thing for the the debate over the branding selected for the symbian foundation website shows a certain lack of clarity of the role symbian software will play in the true to say that there is an entire ecosystem that knows about the specifics of developing for symbian pretty meaningless in its own after still an active that knows how to develop cobol applications for ibm need to consider the size of the ecosystem and appreciate that that ecosystem is small given that symbian os has been around for over a decade and the software powers in excess of 100 million devices consider then the rate of growth of the ecosystems surrounding the offerings from google and apple symbian never generated that level of excitement and never saw that sort of growth in developer of a decade down the line and you could argue symbian have done the hardwork and created the landscape in which google and apple are now but just because symbian was make it best and give it any right to is true to state that the symbian idioms are a pain to it is incorrect to suggest that there is no justification for getting rid of the justification is the persistent 10 years that developing native code for symbian os is too most if not all these painful idioms were design decisions taken over a decade ago and whilst still beneficial on todays mobile devices are no longer mobile hardware has moved on substantially in the last symbian os has not fundamentally at least in terms of the developer consider now where pcs would be if the hardware had developed as it but the software stopped at windows or we almost certainly be able to have this discussion in quite this way for at alternative mobile consider android and both are linux based both use more developer standard development approaches which leave symbian os looking like come from another in itself is not necessarily a problem because as others have symbian os supports several runtime environments that make development for mobile devices that happen to run symbian os much more approachable for the average the runtime support to its natural the underlying os becomes a choice made by the device manufacturer based on time to quality but the end user care and in many cases know what the os developers then develop for their preferred rather than write native not at that conclusion still travelling the long therefore native code still plays an important part in mobile hence the ease with which developers can write for a given platform is important assuming the device manufacturers believe in supporting developer will open sourcing be good for difficult to see how open sourcing will be bad for but whether it will be good or not depends on the ability of the community to make symbian os into the os the community	
 think using a boolean flag is fine you need to cascade the flag to related entries at the db you just need to keep referring to the status of the this is what happens with user remember marking a user as not prompt django to go through related models and magically try to deactivate rather you just keep checking the attribute of the user corresponding to the related instance if each user has many and you want an inactive bookmarks to be just ensure that is unlikely to be a need for an flag on the bookmark

 think you can unify all of these because you know what is being used by each you identify which ones you are interested in then you can get each to output to log files in a central location linux for from here you could write a simple utility that parses each log file and massages the data into a single log file in the format that you the awk utility is very good at doing this sort of you could leave them as they are and use something like splunk to index the files for future searching and it really depends on what you require from the log files at a later hope that

 think you need a domain model similar to the buyer details seller details book details it works is that a user or can create a bid or offer as so if you are a buyer you may start by searching through the offers if you like one you may choose to accept it and proceed to perhaps you quite like any of the offers but one is close in price to what you you might create a bid and have that sent to the creator of the offer to if nothing is close to your requirements as a buyer you may create a bid and leave it in the system for potential sellers to and consider till time of expiry you have have added the bid and offer classes and i think their benefit is self but if you would like some further explanation please feel free to leave a comment and i will the expiry fields are not necessary but most likely every bid and offer will have a time limit in which case you will need have increased the number of but i think you will find that your system becomes much easier to manage and

 think you probably made a poor naming i would think would be a subclass of not the other way so use as the you upcast an to a your reference will only be able to access methods declared in if you downcast it back to an have access to all of the since java objects know what type they really anything that actually is an can always be cast back to no matter what type of reference you are using an there is unavoidable and part of the you could hide it behind some sort of but in your case that probably defeats the in all methods are virtual by this means that if overrides some method declared in then the version will be even if you access it through a if you need to invoke the parent class you can make a call by calling you probably use this very often least of the reasons being that it breaks

 think your focus should be on the object and not on the event for example you have the object eventargs e performactions did something to the effect as as inside the person you would expect to see something to the effect inationality get return set if point here is that you let the object keep track of what is happening to not the this also lets you keep track of dirty flag tracking on your which could be useful for persistence later also keeps your ui clean and keeps it from getting odd event registration code that will most likely be error	
 think your insertion code is only allocating memory but then doing many incrementing the value stored in the single allocated location between hash table stores your so it will end up associating each key with the same you should probably use with for i always recommend using on objects rather than on their that way you repeat yourself in quite as dangerous a instead guint32 a a way you the so that you always allocate enough room to store whatever points even if you later change the you should take a hard look at every cast you casting any pointer to is a sign of a hesitant with is just a synonym for so that cast is never it just adds cruft to your making it harder to	
 think your problem is not a call to pure virtual function can never allow that so it really cause a runtime but that you are calling the function on an invalid memory area that therefore has an invalid virtual am also willing to bet that this may have something to do with how you construct your as automatic variables rather than dynamically allocating as soon as you get out of those that memory is	
 think your understanding is pretty much if you ignore the values and just look at the then for every node in the first tree there must be a corresponding node in the other tree and vice both trees would have the same number of you could write a algorithm to confirm this isomorphism by attempting all possible mapping and ensuring that for every node in the first tree that gets mapped to a node in the the corresponding mapping happens with the parent and with the two are obviously efficient algorithms to check for may benefit from reading about trees are a special easier to case since they do not have

 to extend this a remember that arrays are c so all you have is the address of a piece of memory that purports no to be an array of expand a little therefore really have as all it has are so when you make something an what really happens is you tell the compiler that some variable represents an useful to make a distinction in c between a and a in a simply giving something a name and a in a you actually allocate if we start off by definiing an array means telling the compiler we want space for 100 we want it to all be allocated in one and going to use the name for the operator gives the number of bytes used by a type or an so our array will take up on most that will be 400 but it varies from machine to we define a using as a reminder this is a defining space for a variable that will contain an its size will be which will usually be either 4 or but on some machines could be anything from 2 to 16 on some machines unlikely to run into of the array is the compiler converts that name into an so we can save that address ar this say for convenience that our array happened to be starting at location 1000 in name does have any space allocated to like a a you reverse that this the same reason you this work you change the value of in early versions of this trick would for complicated it was a never lived until tried to debug a program in which the value of is in c are always that the first index is always any other indices are just addresses computed using the is just the address 1000 plus 0 bytes of or is 1000 plus 1 times the size of an so the int and in this is always true in is called an we use the syntax telling the compiler to get the thing at the address contained in is called a we and refer to the same we say telling the compiler we want the thing at the address 0 bytes from is the address one or 4 from refers to the same thing as need the parentheses because we want to add 3 to the address first and then look at the would get the contents pointed to by and then add 3 to thing c or much how big the array really if i come along and do the compiler will happily generate code to look in the cell if in your but if just random fine c c comes from the phone we have the phone we know some which moved down read as equivalent or the same you can depend c know a difference between pointers and you can declare either when you define a you can get exactly the same was anywhere you might write you can replace it with actually a weird side case that breaks but you run into it as a will equal the address at plus this above as when you index into an like it means you want the 42nd whatever over from the start if using then you need to move over 42 times however wide an which is to say all and since is defined as a it all holds for as is a user defined type that overloads and you can decide you want to define a new type that acts just like any other but you can change the way the language does specific a programmer decide to replace the default behavior of the array reference and pointer dereference operators with something of their own as a you be confronted with that but you should be aware of

 to find out what they like about what they are then give them responsibility to make change in this they might think the meetings are too give them the opportunity to lead a few the idea is to get them involved in the most motivated to think that kind of thinking can lead you down a very bad you have to i stress this nearly find out they think the bad thing is a developer complains that too much time is spent on what he really wants is to spend his time writing if instead of him just having to attend the meeting he also has to spend time deciding what happens during the the effect is that spend time completely the opposite result of the one he was hoping an inconsiderate prick in this mind and he feels less motivated about working something to be improved is the same as wanting to be the guy who improves the world owe anyone a servant fix what one wants but sometimes that might be a good economic decision hiring tech writers to write documentation if your coders do

 to give the other if the namespace is unique to your it should be namespaces are best add less than 1 line of boilerplate to any xpath calls you can turn into a helper and require about 15 lines of helper code to generate a but that is the only downside and you always encounter exchange you get unambiguous names for every element and that means you can compose third party namespaces with impunity in theory you could return xhtml directly without application level namespaces turning up is unlikely to be an as they are unlikely to be used on any of the tags that you defined in your in if they then there is a bug the likely explanaintion for there existence is that the framework added them just in case it needed to add an element somewhere below the spot where they are which may not be a location you have to care answer mentioned which is a bit perhaps you could say what namespaces were

 traditional applications that run on the desktop of a computer i recommend variants of the the class responsible for creating and managing the form is a thin shell that passes events to the ui the interact with the form via a in term the ui object implements a interface and registers itself with a view controller that is situated lower in the object then execute object implementing the which modifies the the command object can interacts with the various views via the interfaces exposed by the view this does is allow you to rip off the form classes and replace them with stub classes that implement the form the stub classes are used for automated testing especially for integration interfaces precisely define the interaction between the the commands and the they can be designed to be relatively language agnostic so they can make porting between platform you are missing in your example are command you need this itemlist in the would register with the itemviewimplementation using the sequence of events would look something like wants to update the on the ui that clicking with a form tells through that x has with y itemviewimplementation a command object with it needs from command object take the modifies the model tells through to update the itemviewimplementation tells to update the the itemviewforms advantage of this approach is that the interaction of each layer is precisely defined through the software actions are localized into the command the form layers is focused on display the the view layer is responsible for routing actions and response between the commands and the commands are the only things modifying the also you have the advantage of ripping off the forms implementation to substitute any ui you want including mock object for unit

 truly mathematical way to look at building a recursive function would be as imagine you have a function that is correct for build f such that is build such that is is how you can prove that the function is and called it is equivalent to have different base or more complicated functions on multiple it is also equivalent to imagine that is correct for all for a build a function that can determine if it is possible to have a coin combination of 5 cents and 7 cents to make x for possible to have 17 cents by 2x5 but impossible to have 16 imagine you have a function that tells you if possible to create x as long as x call this function it should be fairly simple to imagine how to make the function for now build your if 7 return else if 5 return return trick here is to realize that the fact that works for means that you can substitute for if 7 return else if 5 return return last thing to do is to have a base case to stop infinite note that if you are trying to create 0 then that is possible by having no adding this condition if return else if 7 return else if 5 return return can be proven that this function will always using a method called but that necessary you can imagine that only calls lower values of and will always eventually reach use this information to solve your tower of hanoi i think the trick is to assume you have a function to move tablets from a to b any trying to move n tables from a to

 two databases is very complicated if both databases need to be if one is a slave of the not nearly as i have more than once programmed just this kind of synchronization using once with an mdb on a web server that had to be synched with a local data mdb incorporate data edited on the no edits went back to the so but still the need to merge edits on the as well as once programming a synch between mysql on a website and access in a master slave the you program a dump of data for each table to a text helpful to have timestamp fields in the mysql tables so that you know when records were created and this allows you to select which records to dump since the last data dump makes the synchronization of data on the access side much way i programmed it was to then import the text files into staging tables that were indexed appropriately and linked to the access once the data dumps are imported into the staging you then have three the new records and append them to the access data this is easily done with an outer with the discuss this as with updated for i wrote dao code that would write sql like the where clause has to be a bit more complicated than that have to deal with and you have to use criteria formatted appropriately for the data with and for text and and no delimiters for numeric but writing the code to do that is pretty code looks something like dim db as dim rsfields as dim fld as dim strsql as set rsfields top 1 field3 from for each fld in your sql statement and execute next set fld set rsfields set db as i the complicated part is writing the where clause for each sql but pretty easy to figure note that in your rsfields recordset is used only to walk through the fields you want to you want to include only the fields that are so leave out the created field and the pk field any other fields that you want to for the might think a good idea to simply delete any record in the local table not in the remote that works fine if it really is a slave but so often what is originally a slave ends up getting its own in that you need to delete records from the master mysql and instead have a delete flag that marks records you could have different varieties of logic that could clean the deleted records out of the master database if using date stamps in the you could delete all records flagged deleted with lastupdated timestamp that is the last time you dumped the you could have the access app send a text file up to the server with a list of the records that have been successfully deleted from the access data if there are edits in the access data then need some logic for dealing with an edit there on a record that was deleted from the mysql you have a true fairly if you really wanted to do it by brute just dump the entirety of all the mysql data tables to text delete all the records in your access data store and import the text would tend not to do as the first time you need to depart from the pure hosed and have to rewrite everything from outline i gave above will work very cleanly for but will also work well if you have a few fields that are private to the or data that exists in the slave and not in the master is the situation i was working	
 two major rendering engines have supported css3 for quite some which makes rounded corners as simple this have any effect on ie6 or 7 works in or 8 so you need to implement the nasty stacked division with images for the which fit your semantic not a fan of that involve javascript or so i use css3 and check that the version in ie7 looks been doing this for a while as ie never used to support png transparency either which meant you nicely overlay a rounded corner image on a patterned ie8 is a big so the problem does start to go away but i understand your desire to make it work on ie6 and various css3 bits and pieces that were originally planned to be included in ie8 were actually removed from the final was one of the	
 two numbers and each number uses and output datatype needs at and your above you have two 31 bit numbers because 1 0x7ffffffe uses 31 bits and you will need to typecast one of them to because it will do a 32 bit multiply and overflow before it casts to number of bits needed for fixed point a b quick example to show the above rule in a 49 decimal 0x31 hex 0x31 can write a function to count or if you just want a quick sanity check to confirm this use something like windows calc that will convert the number into binary form and count the bits	
 two parts of the backup you have to worry the database and the database can be backed up using something like if you have this available on your server not too hard to upload and get it going from you can just export the entire database to a gzip other part is the code and uploaded the codebase change too so you could probably just make one backup of a number of the simplest is to just download the entire folder via though if sure someone will know a single command line to get all the changed files database is the main thing you have to worry about everything else should be able to be rebuilt just by

 updated following update of the question see still think right to be using the factory and correct in overloading the createlabel but i think in passing the labeltype to the createlabel missing the point of using the factory the entire purpose of the factory pattern is to encapsulate the logic which chooses which concrete subclass to instantiate and the calling code should not be telling the factory which type to the benefit is that the code which calls the factory is therefore shielded from changes to that logic in the and also from the addition of new concrete subclasses to the all your calling code need depend on is the and the interface type returned from logic in your code at the point where you call the factory must currently look something like this need to create a label need to create a small label need to create a large label need to create a custom label explicitly telling the factory what to this is because every time a new label type is added to the need the factory code to deal with the new labeltype and add a new to everywhere that the if you move the logic that chooses the labeltype value into your you avoid the logic is encapsulated in the factory along with everything if a new type of label is added to your you only need to change the all existing code calling the factory remains the no breaking is the piece of data that your current calling code uses to decide whether a big label or small label is that piece of data should be passed to the factory and label classes could look like class public labelsize size private public string trackingreference private public string size trackingreference added the null or empty class customlabel public string trackingreference private public string customtext private public string trackingreference throw new customtext class public ilabel labelsize return new public ilabel string return new hope this is

 use namespaces because people xeep wanting to use the same words to mean different things in their own private you can determine from context what a person in a personnel the xml is personnel in a vehicle registry the xml is vehicle registry keep a tag named but the tag means different things to each and contains different but what if you need or want to store xml from both in the same more what if both databases want to store xml chunks from some common database an accounts namespaces associates with each xml tag a such that the tag name itself has a url in front of part of the tag name actual xml documents use a shorthand do do by carefully choosing the its easy to be confident that the tag names wont collide as if the two location tags were named entirely so no as a the two entirely different location tags can include stuff from the accounts and explicitly state that they are talking about the same thing that makes all this useful is the you can start to write xpath expressions that say things find me any sections anywhere in this find me any items anywhere in this particular chunk of where the warning message is a child node of either a node or a xpath expression might be used somewhere in an xslt whose job it is to convert the xml into xhtml or for the why do because you can search the xml pull out all the accounts overdue messages wherever they confusing them with tags produced by other convert to and display them in bold red via a css without writing a scrap of procedural

 use setattribute on html ie gets it badly wrong in many and the properties are faster and easier to is why are you converting it to a string and surrounding it with single it looks like you are trying to do something heinous involving evaluating code in a string is what doing below in the evaluating javascript code in strings is almost always the wrong avoid it like the in the above ie should do the same as it is a i guess what trying to do is make it remember that string by constructing a code string that will evaluate in javascript to the original what happens if has an apostrophe or a got a syntax error and possible security you could do something laborious and annoying try to escape the but ugly and work for other you could even ask javascript to do it for not all objects can even be converted to evaluatable javascript source basically the entire approach is doomed to normal thing to do if you just want to have the onclick callback call a function with a parameter is to write the code in the straightforward this will work and is what you there a slight wrinkle which you may have hit which could be what is confusing you into considering the wacky approach with the if in this case is the variable of an enclosing the reference to do what you think it the will be accessed by the callback function when the click is the loop has at this point the variable will be left with whatever value it had at the end of the so will always be the last element of regardless of which was for some discussion of one of the biggest causes of confusion with closures in both javascript and and should really be fixed at a language level some can get around the loop problem by encapsulating the closure in its own like return in a later version of be able to say you would like to be able to use in browsers you can get an implementation from the or just in var var return return arguments args

 using it is generally a bad idea to use an external without a revision it means that it becomes hard to correlate the version of the external with the version of the containing i know this the hard from trying to track down some history in a project that contained and i would have to guess which revision corresponded to the revision in the containing project it was earlier because someone had updated the external project and then updated the containing sometimes it was later because someone had edited files directly in the external checkout and then committed as suggested by the tip box a couple paragraphs into the section in the subversion you should always commit externals with a revision that whenever you check out a particular revision of the containing the appropriate revision of the external will also be checked it does mean a little more as you have to update the revision number in the property every time wrote a script to do it but in the long run it is a much better here is the skeleton of the script we used rake for conveniently updating the external and keeping everything in external for this project do rev rev or raise svn revision update the sh url sh propset update again to put the externals back to the right sh

 using to interact with a svn repository at work and i seem to find a way to effectively resolve conflicts for the life of read the other questions on this but evidently i need something even more remedial because i always seem to end up in some kind of endless i use mergetool to resolve my conflicts when i get to the end of all i try to do a dcommit and i get a merge conflict during commit know this feels like a but frustration is making me ask with some very specific details about how going about this so that hopefully someone can tell me exactly where my process is screwed have a remote branch a local branch and another local branch that i typically work in trunk was checked out from and was checked out from what been my svn the conflicts for that the merged file from meld and close add rebase i get a message asking whether i used i rebase i get to the end of all the reported everything just kind of stops and i guess maybe not sure what to do at this git shows nothing to be committed and i appear to be back on the git then allows me to but if i try a rebase immediately i end up the conflicts i just clearly a critical piece missing but i just see it and causing a lot of problems and merges may be easy in but sure not finding that to be the just wanted to throw out a quick update to describe my workflow in case part of the after cloning my repository with a i have my remote given co trunk to check out my remote to a local co to create a working branch that i use to create one more degree of separation so that my local can always mirror my remote delete the default master branch working with i find it easier to think in terms of rather than i have all of my my typical workflow looks like i make my changes and commit co and do a svn new code was i rebase co merge rebase co merge svn a lot of i but what everyone here and elsewhere has could my fatal flaw be somewhere in that git svn	
 using views in drupal the answer is yes with some important normal forms in exposed filter values come in as params raher than that means that you can populate an exposed filter just by appending to the current kicker is that if multiple views on the same page are looking for the same filter keys in the they will both use the incoming filter need to configure each list of exposed filters to make sure that they all user the same list of with the same list of for the incoming if you want the filter form to only appear you may have to do some crafty juggling as will want it to appear on each view by but an option on each view to move its exposed filters to a doing that and not enabling the exposed filter block effectively hides the exposed filter while keeping the filtering active if it comes in via the make sure all four views have the same list of exposed and are using the same for the hide the exposed filter widgets on all but one of the at that it should

 want to do this between the channel or and your my preferred practice is to isolate file from structures by write code that builds the file buffers in a known and matching read code that reverses that specific example is particularly difficult to guess at because the bitfields are defined to be unsigned int and is particularly as a swag that then getting a pointer to the struct and reording the individual bytes probably gets you the answer you trick of defining the struct differently for different platforms but in the example you cite there a clean break at byte so it is not likely to be possible to produce an equivalent of one platform in the other without splitting one or more of the fields into two

 want to learn how others cope with the following is not homework or an assignment of any the example classes have been created to better illustrate my question however it does reflect a real life scenario which we would like feedback retrieve all data from the database and place it into an a object represents a single record and if multiple records exist in the we place the data into a of the record say we have the following public class public bool public string public string public public class public bool public string public string public string note that the getters and setters have been omitted from the classes for the sake of before any code police accuse me of not using please note that have been left out for this example database has a table for employees and another for employee what we do is to create a list object that represents the data in the database we do a deep clone of this object which we then bind to controls on the front we then have two objects and representing data from the user then makes changes to the object by deleting we then want to persist these changes to the we want to be as elegant as only deleting those records that require ultimately want to compare the two list objects so that we what properties have changed so that the changes can be persisted to the what properties no longer exist in the second so that these records can be deleted from the what new properties exist in the new so that we can create these in the wants to get the ball rolling on how we can best achieve keep in mind that we also need to drill down into the list to check for any not just the top level hope i have made myself clear and look forward to any object equality for database

 was working on a tablet pc using zoho notebook earlier today and noticed that stylus input is not as accurate or smooth as something like it seems like the functionality is done in so my question then is it possible to increase the accuracy pen tool functionality that is similar to zoho that javascript tracks the such that writing with the stylus flows more mouse tracking	
 was writing an algorithm this morning and i ran into a curious i have two i want to perform a set intersection on the sets of the keys of each find which keys are common to both at some point in the i think likely also want to perform set subtraction here as the stl includes functions for both of those the problem i seem to get a of the keys out of a is there any way to do looking for something that would be this like it is in keys understanding is that i use the function directly on iterators into the maps because the maps expose objects instead of just i think the map guarantees also interested in performing this same operation on a pair of if that makes any i forgot to mention initially that due to the age of the compiler forced to use most of the nifty template tricks that are available in boost can not be can i get a of keys to a	
 way around this is that you could setup a partial class for this you add a new property to it called then in query set that property to it then would not be saved in the database but would give you access to	
 way done this in the past is to include the configuration file as an embedded and just used i could use the configuration syntax i was familiar and have to worry about getting a file	
 way i have found is to open the command prompt and browse through the folder you mention until you find the dll you want you can then user the copy command to get it windows explorer has a special view of this	
 way i share code between silverlight and normal is to use the as feature with so it ends up looking like vs works and both sets of code get the annoying part is where the silverlight framework line has some parts that exist in in that need to use the preprocessor to make the code target both has worked pretty well so this i can write test with but still have it work on sl from the same a few edit from the sl project this way the editor will limit to and you get surprises later you have to close the opened file for intellisense to update in the other	
 way i tackle this is i have seperate configuration files for each deployment the i copy the config files for the type i am for on staging i would copy the into the root of the my script would call to compile the	
 way is to start a select the contents of the row and compare it to what going to update it if they then do the update and end the if they rollback the	
 way is to use a application as mentioned by that is not an option i wrote a simple sendmail utility using vbscript cdo which i called from a batch the examples here	
 way that figured out how to do the javascript code from and put it in the in your tag else sure if this is the most simple way to do it but it got the job	
 way that you can avoid this problem is for any project except for a which has no project of doing a from your source control always do an from source inside of visual and do a get latest from solution vs will only pull files that belong to the not a perfect answer when you perform you will likely end up pulling down every file in your but it has worked very well for this requires that you are using a source control tool that offers vs integration it also requires that you add any but required files to your or they will not be pulled down by	
 way to deal with the original problem is to create a indicating to which numbers should the original entries be mapped for the entries 2 should be mapped respectively to 1 so that we can 2 1 3 1 here is that everything is done in one and that it also works for operations more complicated than swaps drawback is that all elements of a must be positive integers with a known	
 way to do it is to insert the first row explicitly the row id you want to start sqlite will then insert row ids that are higher than the previous	
 way to do this is actually something over by management employee e on by getting into the murkky area of queries and direct you to this column of ask tom on other answers work in simple cases but when you start wanting to do things like returning the top 3 management teams head and doing so consistently that run into is a key as tom a group by clause in a guarantee that the output data will sorted on the group by columns even if there is no order and until there is an order statement on a the returned cannot be assumed to be any without an order data may be returned in any order which the database feels returning this has always true and will always be in oracle database release see group returning data in a random order more often than this sample into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into management values into management values into management values into management values into management values	
 way to find these things out is to use the tool you can download from microsoft this tool allows you to view com type the type library the vendor of the com component provided type library contains information about the interfaces and the methods and properties of the com classes exposed by an application or on my i can view the type library for and see what com objects are exposed by and their properties and displays information in idl description which is more or less a c function prototype with extra attributes tacked is the idl declaration i got using for the hresult variant long the attribute on the this means it be displayed by most is a good hint to not rely on this method always existing microsoft could remove it in a later version of what about the here is the full pictures void unsigned long unsigned long void unsigned void unsigned int unsigned long void unsigned int unsigned long void long unsigned long unsigned short unsigned xlcreator void variant variant variant xlpictureappearance xlcopypictureformat variant variant void double void double void double void double void void bstr void bstr variant void variant void variant variant variant double void double void void double void double long void bstr void bstr double double double double long bstr variant variant variant you can surmise that the interface has a and as well as an among note that this interface is also marked which is a good indication that you really be using it i know you were ignoring that but i second mitch comment that generally a bad idea to use hidden because they are usually meant for the own internal use and are subject to change without

 way to solve this is to not refresh the page but reload its body or a form or a div element using jquery makes this way you can have persistence of script values between	
 way to test exceptions is to put an after code that should have thrown an if your code reaches the it means that an exception was not thrown and the test have exceptioned must catch specific type of exception not just exception as allgeek points whatever logging	
 way to trap these kind of errors is using a class a that throws upon creation with a null pointer it may throw also when but a little late better than i	
 way too silly to say something like is always a horrible there are many cases in modern software where uninstalling dependencies can true and thoroughly the machine at hand source software ideals are only useful for people who want to be able to break their	
 way used it is if i have two implementations of how to do something in a class and i want to choose one at without having to continually go through an if statement void avoid if using a else if using b type of void void typedef void this is only practically useful if you feel the code is being hammered enough that the if statement is slowing things done deep in the guts of some intensive algorithm i still think more elegant than the if statement even in situations where it has no practical use but just my	
 way would be to express the turning radius of the vehicle in grid units per and use a bresenham circle algorithm to incrementally move them into the next adjacent grid unit on each	
 way would be to use a statement and select either or depending on whether the date value is or

 way you usually use ecc for encryption is by using works this the intended receivers public key from a this is the static a temporary ecdh this is the ephemeral the keys to generate a shared symmetric the data with the symmetric the encrypted data together with the public key from the ephemeral receiver can now use the ephemeral public key and his own static private key to recreate the symmetric key and decrypt the can read more in for efficient sec elliptic curve section	
 way you worded your i believe considering the difference between an asmx an ashx and an ajax an actual aspx this is the they are all very the ajax pagemethods for all intents and identical to asmx they create an instance of the so they incur the overhead normally associated with aspx talking about saturating the server with probably find that all three perform	
 ways i can think instead of but you need to set the parameter in order to enforce tcp socket and implement http over it that i would personally go with this solution	
 ways work in without using the access not sure if work in this is just off the top of my after seeing your question after a long so it may be riddled with the class casts itself to a private base in which the members are any other class can call struct unlocked int int call delete on a class locked private unlocked a 0 accessible within b 1 return void o o a a b b int locked foo 1 1 to call an instance of a class must be class is a protected inner class of public class only class can mutate class must privately inherit to make visible to but because both and have no inheriting from them has little you can use as or inherit from class locked class keyed class keyed struct void struct unlocked int int void o o this a a b b class locked private private keyed a 0 b 1 return using void m key k n k int keyed k not locked foo bar not 1 not 1

 we have been using watin and mbunit for web integration testing for the past 3 have separated the tests into 3 contains glue code for setting up test fixtures and various custom mbunit and watin contains page and control classes arranged hierarchically into namespaces that correspond to different domains and parts of the this project serves to decouple tests from the major part of the web site you can think of it as a model of the contains the actual tests also arranged hierarchically into tests leverage the sitemap and framework as needed to interact with the web this way there is much less code duplication than if each test contained the same button ids over and

 we recompile an exe or a its binary image is different even if the source code is the due to various timestamps and checksums in the our quality system implies that each time a new dll is related validation tests must be performed again and it takes a significant amount of our goal is to avoid releasing dlls that have not having an automatic procedure that detect different dlls based only on meaningful information they contain and ignoring timestamps and there a good way to achieve this to automatically detect and release dlls that have really	
 we started developing our created a dated license we that not too many people are even interested in buying our we decided to give it away for a lot more people started to care at least trying our open sourced our a lot more users started using now we just hope that a small number of these users might turn into paying customers buying support or asking for bottom line if someone wants to crack your do it is it really worth it to waste your time trying to protect it with this hidden secret

 web is a book that might help it describes the incentive behind restful web services and gives instructions on how you should design your you then could move on the implementation either using a framework or just plain an alternative to the implementation methods already i would like to add spring it is possible to create restful applications but more direct support will be added in	
 web parts do what you want to you can change the parent programmatically of your controls to move them into a separate	
 web pun programming one would always take this approach because you depend on the validation actually a crafty user can construct a form post or url that simulates your client and sends data back to the a standalone it is less i would suggest that it depends on where the validation is for if your validation runs in your business not in your then your validation ought to run every using separation of the business logic depend on the ui to do after the business logic may be called from a typical a web or even an thing that i would suggest is that doubling up the validation logic in the is probably overkill but you ought to be able to handle errors arising from the underlying in this the errors might arise from

 went the opposite started with then moved to c and for my own personal it was much easier to learn java than in many ways is meant to be with many of the undefined and unnecessarily complicated portions removed or it had great success with that as a result a very easy language to learn and especially for someone who is familiar with actual time it will take is very dependent upon the person learning the i think safe to say it will take less time to become competent in java than it did in	
 went through some testing with this as if you are loading a javascript file it is faster to put it at the end but it does come with some important first is that doing this often made some of my visual effects for if i was using jquery to format a the table would come up unformatted and then the code would run to reformat i find this to be a good user experience and would rather the page came up putting it at the end made it hard to put code in your pages because often functions exist if you have this in your that work until the jquery object is if defined at the end of your page the above will produce an you could argue that all that styling code could be put in the external file but that would be a mistake for performance i started off doing that on a project and then found my page took a second to run through all the javascript that had been so i created functions for the relevant behaviour and then called the appropriate ones in each reducing the javascript load run time to you can minimize the load time of javascript by versioning your javascript files and then using expires headers so only loaded once time at which point where they are in the file is largely all in all i found putting putting the javascript files at the end of the file to be cumbersome and ultimately	
 went through this well i still sensitive text of and casting needed almost data is but not close to bad form in in an without an clause use or the can be crazy are encoded with character not can have multiple with multiple schemas really has just one database and multiple is postgres time column postgres requires update multiple tables at the same time in functions are so there is no rewrite as a function and

 what i get is or you split a number into two parts by dividing it by another number and then code the integer result of that division in unary and the remainder in the wikipedia they use 42 as and 10 as so we end up with a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 2 binary so that the resulting message is or 8 bits comma can be the simple binary representation of 42 is or 6 this seems due to the unary representation of which always has to be more bits than missing some important point what is get golomb rice it does make more bits of the or does

 what little i know the functionality of reflector is available in pretty much all java including just add a file to a projects and you can browse its classes just as you browse your own the decompiler aspect opposed to the pure class there are some alternatives as the jdk tool only decompiles to so it really useful to get to the source code might help with getting an understanding of the is a pretty popular decompiler in the java world and it produces compilable java code most of the time bytecode sequences easily translatable to valid java so some corner cases

 why would you wish to do that makes things asynchronous so that the user forced to sit and wait while data is coming would be a very poor user expereince if each time an app requested data the user had to wait on it coming back before anything else could you need synchronus if making say 2 calls and call 2 comes in before call but 2 relies on the data inside 1 then left with either fire off event 2 till 1 comes back will slow down your app much like synchronus or implement a way to check that event 1 has come back in event handler are many ways you could do firing off many events then why not have a wrapper class of some description that tracks your events and do anything on the responses until all events are can use the asynctoken to keep track of individual so if you are firing of loads at once then you can find out exaclty whats come back and whats

 will not talk about it is well known and talk about nginx vs second one is much more feature easier to configure and it has a way better when talking about deployment of fcgi or scgi application api django actually there are several important points that lighttpd provides support for spawning fcgi and scgi applications on its meaning it can fork and manage it for you if you scgi spawning use lighttpd when it comes to nginx you manage you application on your own use your own startup provides support of both sockets and unix domain sockets for both nginx and apache does not provide support of unix domain sockets for provides native support of cgi in nginx you should do a silly workarounds using regular expressions to provide that is not does not support cgi meaning that if you have a simple task to do that can be easily done with it is impossible for nginx to handle of fcgi for lighttpd is way simpler about nginx is indeed nice web but it my first is my little experience with development using various strongly recommend to use the problem was fixed in nginx there are still too many issues with nginx and for example which actually means that you deploy streaming comet methods behind development style of nginx is very patchy if there is some problem say a bug or missing feature reported it would not be ported to other modules like http or scgi and vise examples url decoding are general nginx development is very patchy and documentation is inconsistent you can find in some pages stuff this module is based on module the documentation there may be give yourself a favor use

 works try we use it with in your updated you asked about using frameworks such as jquery with can you do would you want a more difficult in you let webforms generate javascript for why you have updatepanel and the on one this is because you can focus your coding attention on and you can use grid components which require you to write any javascript at all to make them on the other limited to what the generated code can you can write javascript even in but you have to work around some of the things the framework like changing ids on you can write event handlers in but this requires the use of which do not fit naturally in with consequences that are visible to the is common to use jquery with mvc in no small part because it ships with the but even before that it was still very common to use the two together because jquery makes it very easy to do things which are otherwise not directly supported within like making controls on a page interact with each this means you have to write but as long as ok with you get the huge advantage that you can write any kind of interaction you want to without having to postback to the you are just looking for a good grid control for then i would suggest using a control designed for rather than a grid designed for the reason is that the code you will write will fit more naturally within the idioms of you just want to learn a really good because the framework is and but not sure that a great control is the best place to a better place to start might be adding visual flair to some of your existing it is easier to start with known html and manipulate it with jquery than it is to be generating new html and learning jquery at the same

 world has check down and upvote think is still relevant even though there is a lot of hype surrounding bdd and other testing being if you are up for you could bypass learning and start with something like rspec and shoulda right but there is something to be said about following through the examples in the agile web development book to see where the ideas from bdd came find myself still using for some projects since it comes with rails and is still a very great testing long story i think obsolete but not the cutting edge any bdd is a testing paradigm shift especially if you start using cucumber and but fantastic once you get into shoulda is the easiest to make the transition so i would start with then move to then give rspec and cucumber a are testing or at least interested in the best in the end it matter what you use as long as you are happy with

 would add that ability to memory and performance trace is absolutely invaluable may also have a memory diff but i see a performance able to run a profiling session before and after a bug fix or then compare the results is incredibly especially with a mammoth legacy application in my where performance was never a priority and where finding bottlenecks could be very doing a diff allows you to see the in call count for each and the in duration for each is helpful not only during code but also if you have an application that uses a different for each if one customer complains of you can run a profiling session using their database and compare the results with a database to determine which operations are contributing to the of course there are many performance but sometimes i really helps to see the performance metrics from the application side closer to what the actually dottrace works and the diff is

 would appear that a simple scheme will work the number of points in the by first computing the convex only the points on the convex hull will contribute to any interaction with any convex bounding so retain only the subset of points on the perimeter of the can easily be argued that the minimal radius bounding must have one edge of the convex hull coincident along the diameter of the if some edge of the hull does not lie in the then there exists a different with smaller diameter that contains the same set of each edge in convex hull often has relatively few so this will go now it becomes a simple minimization if we choose to assume the edge in question lies on the then we merely need to find the center of the it must lie along the current line which we are considering to be the so as a function of the position of the point along the current just find the point which lies farthest away from the nominal by minimizing that we find the radius of the minimal along that line as a just choose the best of the possible found over all edges of the convex	
 would approach any custom development project on carefully especially if you do not have any experience with the there are many pecularities to how the api works and it takes time to recognize and anticipate there are also some techniques that are vital for keeping the solution stable and scalable wrapping sharepoint object instantiation inside not to mention understanding how a application is first need to understand the platform and how it works before getting too far ahead of yourself and i would strongly caution against seeing it as a development platform more of a framework with some extensibility on you really need to have a solid idea of how your project will be from development through training and far too many sharepoint projects fail due to inadequate planning and more see paul do sharepoint projects r

 would definitely not recreate the database each instead i would do the in the file and create some object based on each each row get the name and set that in the it were me i would also have an in memory cache of all the symbols and the current price data is never an int you can use company name is probably not unique as there are many options for a particular that should be an index and you can save space just using the id of a someone else also pointed out your web clients do not need to have to hit the actual database and do a query you can probably just hit your that really depends on what tables and data you expose to your clients and what data they query access for other users is also a reason not to keep removing and creating a

 would never need to write the code in the second the does nothing except leak the second you create an nsmutabledictionary and assign it to then in the next you assign a copy of another nsmutabledictionary to meaning that the original dictionary pointed to is now just floating off somewhere on the unable to ever be will need to release in either as laid out in the memory management	
 would normally have two problems with putting a problem aside for a my boss probably go for it because the business will usually need a solution sooner as opposed to and i have the attention span of a gold so if i drop a problem for that i will have to take time to walk through the problem because filled my brain with dozens of other problems in the not entirely because sometimes i do find a more elegant solution when forced to refresh myself on the code and the business constraints that define the but sometimes i just spend half a day running myself into the same that being the idea of putting a problem aside is a good but the time frame often realized a solution while eating breakfast the morning following an end of the day brain lock up to articulate the problem to colleagues often just because the effort will expose gaps in your understanding of the usually the other person find a better solution unless actually working with you on the problem from the just because they understand all the constraints that probably spent days mapping out in your answer the original my preferred method after taking a break and running it by some is to implement the adequate solution and just get something reason is that if the client decides that what they because they never really know what they want in the first you have spent too much time on something be thrown out another reason is that the adequate solution might just be you can move the best reason is that an implementation gets you into the hard questions and from there you might start to see a better like building models as an you can do lots of and even spend a lot of time on nice but really more effective to quickly get a glue gun and starting throwing cardboard models once you can see it in 3d you can start to see where things line up and you wasted your time on nice renderings that will gloss over the

 would only be helpful if you had a of and wanted to call a method with an argument that was of things that are where t i think it helps suspect you are going to need a some set of objects that know how to feed a given type of and keep trying them until you find one that knows	
 would probable first look at having as a pointer instead i local vaiable to probable be then you dont use double storing of the variable as or whatever type i val if set the valur inside else if 2 set the valur inside else hint for optimizing your code could be to avoid using operator when you are not interested in the it depends on your compiler but this has proven way faster for me a macro for if is at least on most cases i have true that the profit is not so large when using modula calculations using only but if you ever are looning at a larger calue than 2 to do modula operation and are just interested in of the modula returns zero then my macro is faster in all the compilers i have	
 would probably use but tk is definitely not the lack of releases is due to the bugs being ironed out over the a lot of people still use and it generally works event loop is somewhat but that is a detail that probably concern the only disadvantage is that your gui looks like it is from but who tool included with git showed that tk guis look fine as long as	
 would recommend learning html and css that is the cornerstone of anything do on the for learn once you can make basic html i would then choose to pursue either or there are good jobs in both i would say pick if you like and flash if you like the visual aspects of web development as an developer i would say of my day is doing database related work with ms sql really focus on if you develop with you should program in rather than i started as a programmer and had to switch to simply because most of the professional world uses hence it will be easier getting a

 would say that choosing between sockets and remoting you better consider on what type of application you are sockets are definitely for your own protocol low level programming and the only way to go if you have to communicate to the other remoting is a preffered way to develop new communication where you need to come down to stack and ensure your application talks to the others legacy in case you could go only with better to choose and wcf framework instead of the last one is dead and unsupported

 would strongly consider moq as well if working with rhino documentation does not clearly differentiate between the number of that you can which easily leads to in writing your tests that can lead to all kinds of introducing myself to rhino for the last two and incorporating it into our tests for a new product version we are i am in the process of changing everything over to i simply cannot introduce rhino to our developers and get success with the learning curve is too time intensive for very little i care if they understand the difference between stubs and partial or strict or simplicity and discoverability of the moq api means all our developers can start mocking right away without caring about niggly i guess it helps that our managers have the same philosophy on mocking that the creator of moq

 would sugest using regular at first i would split into sections with the following split each section into match the three possible subsection you must analyze range type it is a matter of parsing the extracted strings into numbers and adding them into putted everything together into a small console application that does the it is far from perfect no error no just parsing a demo i merged some of the expressions mentioned before to get the code compacter and probably class static void string input match sections foreach section in match subsections foreach subsection in match subsectionparts if decimal start decimal end decimal step if end if step decimal current while current to allow things like using decimal instead of single or numbers in the input are decimal numbers and cannot be represented by single or double because they use a base 2 so for represented by the single value x i i x programm will print after only 8 after 1000 iterations the error grows to displaying instead of and after one million iterations the result is instead of are no such errors for because decimal uses a base 10 representation and is able to exactly represent decimal numbers like	
 would suggest architecture using even another ms messaging in order to talk to your what you are effectively doing is writing a device driver for a specialized piece of by making it you the code into a windows service which can run on any machine your web server can connect not just the local have the server handle multiple so that clients other than your web server can access the hardware and the access contention is handled in a rational think test console for the a cool line to your resume about writing systems and windows some other benefits that i think of now written with you can also abstract the service to handle multiple devices at the same	
 would suggest calling the function to add an assembly to the gac something following powershell guidelines like also the location of varies based on your if you have vs 2008 it should be at the location shown begin function process if addgacitemimpl end if addgacitemimpl that the cmdlet comes from the function super robust wildcard support check for weird types like but at least it can handle regular invocation and pipeline	
 would suggest looking at the javadoc for the thread you have multiple mechanisms for thread main thread could the three threads and would then not proceed until all three are the thread state of the spawned threads at all of the spawned threads into a separate threadgroup and poll the on the threadgroup and wait for it to get to a custom callback or listener type of interface for sure there are plenty of other ways still	
 would suggest merging all the scripts together into one js and then using the to pack them into a smaller	
 would suggest not going this at build time but at you probably have enough processor speed to deal with the generating of the i would aim to save on would definitely set your web server to send out the pages as compressed files the application you can build in filters that will take your finalized rendered html pages and do the processes you speak removing could build an isapi which is the older harder you could create stream filter and just override the write set the to be your stream a quick	
 would suggest not to use or or any other connection oriented go for a connectionless protocol or reason is if you require lots of small files to be uploaded or and the response should be as fast as you want to avoid the cost of setting up and destroying would suggest that you look at either using an existing implementation or implementing your own http or https	
 would suggest that you read the datagridview to do my bidding a tale of combobox first i was optimistic about the datagridview samples the datagridview but i see anything that did what i wanted to take an enum value and represent it in the grid with a how i did you should check out bind objects to windows forms datagridview following code example demonstrates how to bind a collection of objects to a datagridview control so that each object displays as a separate this example also illustrates how to display a property with an enumeration type in a datagridviewcomboboxcolumn so that the combo box list contains the enumeration	
 would suggest two interfaces and dependency as a way to decouple your interfaces give you a way to define a contract or set of expected behaviors that is independent of any when you have a class depend on an interface rather than on a you get the freedom to substitute other classes that implement the interface without having to rewrite the class that is depending on you use interfaces with dependency give the class the actual implementation that it is to work on rather than have it create a particular implementation on its you achieve even more decoupling in your now the class only knows about the interface and even know how to create just use dependency injection is often used with creational patterns such as builder or where you localize the construction of objects in a single class so that only that class need change when you extend the application with additional remember that coupling its is a relative you eliminate all coupling or your objects be able to having some level of dependence is you need to balance it with ease of use and implementation as for your particular hard to tell without actual i suspect that you are the solution and violating the dry principle repeat you may need to look at ways to use interfaces and perhaps a lightweight wrapper to decouple your classes from the framework component rather than a complete	
 would suggest using 16 digit identifiers that when printed or shown to customers are formatted in the format of but stored as numbers without the dashes in your reason for using this format is that it makes it easier for people reading out the number over to phone to read as they can do it in batches of 4 rather then trying to remember how much they have said you wish the first 4 digits can be used to identify the type of 1000 for 2000 for 3000 for 4000 for invoices second set can then by a identifier if you wish to keep that sort of information encoded in the number using a format of yymm so would be a customer entered in march then leaves you with 8 digits for the actual data would consider the use of letters in the identifiers to be a very bad idea for any system that deals with telephones as the differences in accents and understand is so varied that people are bound to get upset at trying to get their identifier recognised by someone who cannot understand their accent

 would suggest using or as the parameter collections should be preferred to reference if you happen to have an array does the conversion allows gets and sets back through to the but obviously not modifications which would change the array may have to use wildcards in static void extends for something something is processed is noteworthy that and work slightly keeps the original array to back the so changes to the collection will be reflected in the makes a copy of the collection making a copy is often what you would want anyway if you are returning an if you are passing as an argument you generally do not copy storing as a	
 would suggest using the associative array to pass named but keep them in the array without extracting echo a couple of reasons for looking at that you can quite clearly see that referring to one of the arguments passed into the if you extract and notice the you the next will be there scratching your head wondering where this variable came even if you know extracting the arguments to local still a guessing game to a certain it ensures that other code overwrite the you may have written your function expecting only to have arguments named and so in your other you define for later you might want to expand your function to take a new parameter called but forget to change your other so no matter what gets passed in the will always be set to are some benefits to using the array too apply equally to the methods of extracting or leaving in the you can set up a variable at the top of each function called myfunc overwrite all the defaults with the you here if you echo john could even remove all items from which have a corresponding this way you know exactly which variables you	
 would suggest using the member because some files may already be open but allow you access on the i would guess that in all files open for access would not allow your code to to the course mehrdad already if you are using an editor such as notepad to open the file as a you will not be able to restrict access because notepad does not lock the file at

 would think the best option is to let the php script first set a flag in the session array to indicate that it is processing a that way a second request can be set to wait until the original request has completed a sleep call server side waiting for the flag to is important not to interfere too much with the submit button and because the nature of the web is one of the user may want to click a second time if no answer has and you want to lose their that could occur if the first request is lost and you have disabled their only way to submit therefore the cleaner solution is to submit the and use javascript to display a message saying so that the user can see that something is but they are not prevented from the

 writing a simple custom control and banging my head against the wall trying to figure out how to implement what seems like a my custom is supposed to work similarly to the list in windows that it displays a list of items as but when the user selects an item in the a clickable button should appear next to the item in my trying to display an button next to each item in my order to keep the custom somewhat trying to display the button by overriding the method the button is conceptually part of the list box but i get it to work quite should note that trying to use a single button for the entire when the user selects a item in the the method just this single button so that it appears next to the selected i have it the problem now is that when the is scrolled and the selected item goes the button is still drawn to its previous so it draws on top of the wrong guessing this is because windows try to redraw the selected item if it is and thus the repositioning code get is version of what i have right partial class eventlistbox private button public set up the button that will appear next to the new add the button as a child control of this protected override void if draw item here if drawing the selected the button so that inside the current and make it visible if it is these checks prevent the resulting repaint that will occur from causing an infinite the problem seems to be that if the listbox is scrolled such that the selected moves this code because it repaint the selected item this means the button will be painted in its previous the real question is there a better way to approach the whole notion rendering buttons within listbox if protected override void for for using a single would rather create a separate button for each item in the but i find any way to track when items are from the i find any relevant methods that i could and i the property to a custom collection since is because of i went with the above approach of using a single button and it as but as i this very robust and breaks current thinking is it would make the most sense to create a new button at the point when new items are added to the and remove buttons when items were are some possible solutions i came up but is there a better way to implement could just create my own methods directly derived i could create a each time a new item is remove the button to this ugly because it forces me these special of just could draw a new button manually in using but then i have to do a lot of extra work to make it act like a real since is doing nothing more than drawing the figuring out when the user hovers over this and when it is seems like it would be difficult to get is i could create a new button if the item being drawn already have a button associated with it could keep track of this with a but i still need a way to remove unused buttons when their corresponding items are removed from the i guess i could iterate over my dictionary of mappings and remove items that exist in the but then iterating over two lists every time an item in the is redrawn is there a better way to include clickable buttons inside a obviously been done but i find anything useful on the only examples seen that have buttons in a were wpf but looking for how to do this with is the best way to draw controls as within each item in a winforms

 wrote a sample program that does just it has a class that will go do some processor intensive then i specify the total number of threads i want to and the total number of times i want the work to the program will then equally divide the work between all the threads only one it just gets it and start them all ran this on a single proc vm since i could find a real computer with only 1 processor in it thread 5000 work units threads 5000 work units seems to show that on a one proc with lots of threads that are doing processor intensive windows is smart enough not to rapidly switch them back and and they take about the same amount of together as close as i could get to pushing enter at the same thread 5000 work units threads 5000 work units is the meat of the when you run 10 threads 1 they all seem to be scheduled the 10 threads each took longer there was an 11th thread while the other thread took almost twice its time it got of its work done in the first then did the other in the next is about scheduler is fair on a thread but not on a process if you make a lot of it you can leave the other processes that smart enought to make lots of threads high and or just do it right and us a thread pool interested in trying it for you can find my

 you are using you are not i would strongly suggest migrating to it from its very easy to you can build a with all your udf methods and have the inherit from then in the onrequeststart method set a variable called the entiure you can then use to access the its very nice and simple way of handling if you like you can have all your cfcs inherit from the same basecomponent so that all your cfcs have those util functions as native makes unit testing cfcs very easy because the cfcs dont need to reply on a passed reference to the udf they are decedents of challenge with this approach is that the extends attribute of a cfc cannot be an so depending on how you package your this can be hard to the easiest way to handle it is with a coldfusion

 you can peek at a queue to see if a message is in it before simply query the queue using select instead of receive and you can look at the better bet would be to send the messages and have the stored procedure which receives the messages decide if the message should be tossed out or send hundreds of thousands of messages to service broker at a time without any sort of performance you are seeing performance issues then try sending more than one message per conversation as that is the quickest and easiest way to improve service broker

 you catching exceptions that you want to then filter more so you can then change your decide not to handle them and so rethrow you want to be really careful about not really a good better to never catch the exception in the first the reason is that a given handler should not take the decision to run nested blocks for exceptions that it is not expecting to for if there is a probably a very bad idea to continue executing any code as it will probably cause another such exception to be and blocks are just like any other as soon as an exception is caught for the first any blocks on the stack beneath the will be by which time too late another exception may be and this means that the original exception is implies that you have to careful write out a separate handler for all the exception types you want to it also implies that you can only filter by exception this is sometimes very hard advice to should be possible to filter exceptions in other but in it is it is possible in and the bcl itself takes advantage of this by having a small amount of code written in so it can filter exceptions in a more convenient a detailed with a code from the clr team my two

 you choose a language like tcl or python and tk for your application development it becomes fairly trivial to write your own dsl for describing the you for write a dsl that lets you create menus like file open save exit edit cut copy paste and your main gui forms like propertiesform newuserform username enable the following feature feature feature properties new user and so tcl really excels at letting you write dsls like note that this capability built in to tcl per but the language makes dsls some of this type of thing exists on the for example code to create menus similar to what i described at made that after a while find it really hard to make professional grade uis in this	
 you clarify what kind of you override void

 you delete a you have to do something about its there are no children no you just remove the there a left also no you remove the node and move its left child into its for the right just move the child into the place of the deleted problem comes when you want to delete a node which has both left and right you could move the left or the right child into the place of the deleted but what do you then do about the other child and its is you locate the logical successor to the node being by logical i mean say you have a tree made of integers and you delete node with value the logical successor the next largest if you were doing an it would be the element you come to after the element a simple rule to find the logical you go right one always have a because this is the case where you have two and then you go as far left as you element you end up at is the logical larger than the deleted element went right at the but the next largest that element always has only one or no children because you went left as far as you so you go left any more because there is no left so that element has no children or just a right child and that means it falls into one of the catagories children or just one so unlinking element is comes the cool bit consider if that next largest element were in the same place in the tree as the element you want to tree would still be valid and because everything to the left of each element is everything to the right is what you do is you copy the user data in the next largest node into the node being deleted and you delete next largest has no children or just a right so easy to unlink and basically find your logical unlink him from the tree and put his user data into the element actually originally deleting you then of because still physically part of the

 you do not override anything that compares your objects may get it it is documented that must return the same value if two instances are then it is the prerogative of any code which wishes to test them for equality to use as a first pass to group objects which may be equal it knows that objects with different hash codes cannot be if your method returns different values for equal objects then they may get into different groups in the first pass and never be compared using their could affect any data but would be particularly problematic in based ones such as dictionaries and always override when you override and ensure their implementations are

 you have an existing object model and you are looking to migrate to an orm solution then i would say nhibernate would certainly be a good have to make additions changes to your domain model classes to support nhibernate goes a long way towards supporting persistence ignorance in your domain although you may find you need make some minor changes such as marking more methods properties as virtual than you otherwise would for mapping your existing object you can generate the schema for your this is a huge time saver for domain driven just this functionality is supported via the method with fluent nhibernate or via the hbm2ddl tool with standard nhibernate mapping this also of with maintainability changes to your object model can be quickly reflected in your database fluent nhibernate for mapping helps to make the initial mapping quite fast as you get autocomplete and a simplified mapping this will also help to give you the maintainability you are looking for your mapping is declared in code with fluent so refactoring tools will change your mapping you may also find that you can use fluent nhibernate automapping and avoid manually mapping your object model for the most entity framework for this will be more while entity framework is a capable orm in many it is not as mature as nhibernate and there are a few reasons in this case specifically why i think probably not the best will have to make a lot of changes to your existing object model to support entity if you want to use the currently supplied tools for entity framework you will probably need to migrate your code to generated partial classes which inherit from the entityobject entity framework base this inheritance requirement may or may not be a problem for you depending on your existing object you could avoid this by supporting in your code but this is and i think you will lose a lot of the built in tooling support for managing your will almost certainly need to manually create the database with a good sized object model this is typically not an insignificant entity framework does not support transparent lazy loading out of the sure transparent lazy loading is something you are used to with an and it is supported by most other nhibernate of but with entity framework you will find that you need to explicitly related objects parent and child before you reference them in your there are workarounds for this but not a in my for or where you are trying to leverage an existing object nhibernate is a better for the entity framework linq to sql or even become more viable may also want to evaluate commercial orm offerings such as i have little experience with this particular tool myself generally object to paying for an orm when there are good free but it is highly

 you have an internal data structure that you want to prevent simultaneous access to by multiple you should always make sure the object locking on is not reasoning behind this is that a public object can be locked by and thus you can create deadlocks because not in total control of the locking means that locking on is not an since anyone can lock on that you should not lock on something you expose to the outside means that the best solution is to use an internal and thus the tip is to just use data structures is something you really need to have full control otherwise you risk setting up a scenario for which can be very problematic to

 you have binary data like buffer want to initialize it like this out a that handles this populatebitset bitmap you want the raw use the populatebitset bitmap do end up allocating the needed memory so you might be better off with a stack allocation and a or you just can wait until and let the move semantics do their unecessary in populatebitset clarify why the first versions allocate twice as much a look at another way to write the first just to shorten the populatebitset bits const bits initialize bitmap copy over data from temp to you put these two lines as in the first you still get a temporary constructed on the followed by an in boost needs to allocate enough memory for the entire set of in boost needs to allocate again enough memory to hold that same set of bit and then copy the values possible that bitmap already has enough so it may not always need to but also possible that it will free its backing memory and reallocate from scratch containers that fit the stl mold also have a swap function that you can use in place of assignment when you intend to throw away one side of the these are usually and as they often just involve swapping some see this for another reason why these are be able to use and still get the advantages of since you can overload on the the container know that when you assign a it knows that it can cannibalize the temp and basically do a the visual studio team blog has covered rvalues and move semantics well

 you have to read the compiler error messages the first error was is not a a is a namespace brings in all of brings in only baz from want to does two good it brings in a for you to and it bring in all the rest of which is good because you should only bring in what you so as to not accidentally depend on something you realize depending as foo is static in still have to refer to you do something like writing a free function that forwards to in this is a bad idea if only doing it to save some may advise not using using declarations at instead fully qualifying all this is quote and error and it gets in the way of say that you fully qualify every use of class and then management just before about to go to that you use very similar stack because barmatic just bought out your you fully qualified be doing a lot of hoping your regex was if you used a using you can just make a fix to your header in this a using declaration is a lot like a int or a manifest constant or int foo in that it provides one place to change something referred to many fully qualifying a namespace at every use takes away that had you used a using directive and brought in all of namespace your grep might have been even if say management insisted on but you still had to use the barmatic equivalent for baz being for whatever reason bringing in one type at a time is generally the most the way to best protect yourself against inevitable but as yet unknown as in most you want to minimize tedious repetition while keeping sufficient

 you have used and vba should feel pretty vb has become object oriented after version so there is some new things to you want to broaden your knowledge a is a good would recommend learning some even if you want to go on to they both use the framework and compile into nearly identical il so most of what you learn in is useful in also quite useful to be able to translate between as you then can use coding examples in either

 you implement an interface in there is nothing to prevent the caller from looking at what concrete implementation you have casting to that class and calling methods that are not in the i believe this is called way to prevent this is to create a wrapper that only has the methods and does not expose the implementation instance to which it short of reflection to private variables you should be there a way to automatically create these kind of wrappers not using a code creation wizard in the because that still creates a source file that needs to be generation of wrappers to prevent

 you install end up with two separated the application from the data and the nexus application is in and the data and configuration is in this was mainly done to facilitate easier but it also has the of making it very easy to backup a nexus simple store repositories in a database or do anything that would preclude a simple backup of the file system under if you need to create a complete just archive the contents of the you want a more intelligent approach to backing up a nexus you will certainly want to backup everything under if you want to backup the metadata and file attributes that nexus keeps for proxy backup although this required as the information about the proxy repository will be generated as attributes are need to backup and you need to backup the lucene indexes in pro is a nexus professional plugin which can automate the process of creating a backup of the nexus configuration this plugin is going to address the contents of the if you need to backup the you will need to configure some backup system to backup the contents of that once as with nexus open there is currently no real benefit in backing up the contents of or storage for remote your question you mention that you want to exclude the storage devoted to the local cache of a remote if you are interested in doing have to take a further level of granularity and just exclude the directories under that correspond to the remote you need to shut nexus down for a fox told me the only real chance for file contention is going to be the files in the you have a problem backing up the filesystem with a running instance of thanks for the this answer will likely be incorporated into the next version of the nexus

 you look at your those two blocks are very i bet they can be refactored into a single that sound like an it i think in general if you feel the desire to use braces like you are dealing with a situation that would be better handled by factoring out another method or refactoring pieces general once i got good at oo and limiting how much work i do in a single never thought they might be a good with code that it must be fairly easily try a sorry if i get the syntax i really do and java have i know output is it is in the example as var var you never said where source came var items p getcontent may need to be passed you say where those calls came see comments return like this save much but they show up some great as the relationship between foosource and transforma possibly the getcontent is a decent chance that they should be stored in a single object and that object should be passed or something hard to tell from this often refactoring requires a much wider view of the code than you that they also force you to think about getfoocontent and bet you a pint of beer that these are so similar that they could either be factored into a single method call with a variable or two passed in or into a method in two sibling of the way this kind of relationship always shows up and always improves other code in your i believe these kind of refactors are absolutely doing this kind of refactoring more than anything taught me real

 you need to compare using one of the build in equivalence you can use or depending on whether you want to look for equality using or b b b b you can these functions return the sublist starting at the first matching element if they find an this is because if you are searching a list that may contain you need to be able to distinguish the case of finding a from the case of not finding the element you are looking a list is a true value only false value in scheme is so you can use the result of or in any context expecting a such as an or b is the difference between the three different based on which equivalence function they use for thus tests if two objects are the same underlying it is basically equivalent to a pointer comparison direct value comparison in the case of two strings or lists that look the same may not be because they are stored in different locations in thus performs a deep comparison on lists and and so basically any two items that print the same will be is like for almost anything but for two numbers that are numerically equivalent will always be but they may not be is because of bignums and rational which may be stored in ways such that they be that some behavior of the functions is undefined by the and thus may differ from implementation to i have included examples that should work in any compatible scheme that implements exact rational you need to search for an item in a list using an equivalence predicate different than one of the built in then you may want or from x 2 3 4 5 5

 you really need to do you basically need to use a see the hoglund butler subverting the windows but you will be fighting the operating system and the vendors every step of the also raymond repeated discussions of for why windows support this basically if you are allowed to remove yourself from task manager then users are going to want another utility which shows them hidden and then you are going to want a way to remove yourself from that et cetera ad you really must do by the you will need to use c or not	
 you really want is process monitoring so that if either the parent process or the child process you can take appropriate the simplest way to do this is to have them ping each other on a timer 30 you have to tune for your and if no response comes by the time you send the next ping then you can assume the other process has locked or otherwise stopped playing the parent stops responding the child should just if the child stops kill it and start a new to implement the pinging is left as an exercise for the but any ipc mechanism will rpc whatever strikes your keep it sure has something you can	
 you really want to call the database every 15 seconds for each that an not saying that your database will be thats how you do should show an or the link to that page in order to gt an appropriate because it all depends in what are you doing in the i i will give you an answer on what probably is you said that new to the ajax make things and not to complicate on the you should return a json object and use it to re populate your we will start with 2 buttons and so the user can move the data that is showing probably want to give 100 lines to see say that you have 2 a and in the you will need to load jquery for and add a little but where the table is to be just add a div tag with an because we will get the data from the file has to output only the table html code with all the data without no the idea is to add inside the div called mytable all the code generated by imagine that gets a page variable in the that will tell what page you should show use limit in your mysql or postgreesql can use jquery plugin called witch is one of my his and how small code you need to just using jquery and datatables first description follows the to load the and add as a child of the div and wold do this for the previous and next passing a querystring with the page that the user to simple and you can see the website for if you prefer to use the datatables then just follow their examples after all this need drop me a

 you really willing to do dev work with no seems to me that would limit you to practically trivial after a very brief learning i think find the matlab integrated debugger to be fantastic a vs you insist on doing your best option is to compile your to be runnable stand that would require access to the that there is a significant difference between the compiler distributed with matlab versions up to and those distributed with matlab know the compiler version in the compiler generated that could be than edited and compiled from 7 the compiler did no or any code generation for that running a program today practically runs it on a virtual matlab machine called the which encompasses almost all matlab it is a massive one mcr installer weighted 130m last time i debate on this can still be found on but not important in the mcr approach seems closer to what you for me works perfectly on windows it launches matlab as a but that would deprive you both of a text editor a

 you running the 1408fs in the mode as opposed to the mode user page either it sounds like that your sampling rate is too slow to catch the signal from your also are you using daq point that comes to my from your description it sounds like you have matlab logging the difference in time between signal from each of your three sensors are at known again if your sampling rate is too slow it will appear as if your object has moved instantaneously from one sensors to the you could use the external trigger on your daq with one of your am having some difficulty in imaging the type of signal you receive from your i image it is some sort of step that is the sensor is will read zero and the pulse for a short time as the object passes something like sensor sensor 0 the object passes the sensor the signal increases and then decreases back to this case the sensors might be too close together for the speed of your since the signal from the two sensors my	
 you said it reasonably well right truth is that the comb is almost always a bad idea exception happening for example when marshaling or when for a short interval you may not have all the type information at as josh a sign of a bad class hierarchy way that you a bad idea is that it makes the code if you use and the type hierarchy then it probably breaks that comb everywhere it you then lose the benefit of strong the compiler help you by catching errors ahead of is somewhat analogous to the problems caused by typecasts in me extend this a since from a comment it appears i quite the reason you use a typecast in or it that you want to say use this as if it were a in there is no run time type information around at so just working without a if you typecast the generated code is going to treat that address as if it contained a particular type no matter and you should only that it will cause a error instead of silently corrupting typing just raises that to a in a weakly typed language like ruby or python or everything is an untyped you shoot messages at it at runtime and see what if it understands a particular it like a it handles can be very handy and because it allows marvelous hacks like assigning a generator expression to a variable in or a block to a variable in but it does mean vulnerable to errors at runtime that a strongly typed language can catch at compile a language like you have duck typing at you tell the compiler what type going to treat something you can get something like duck typing by using type so that you can do something a reference to an analogous to a void in some code that assigns something to some more at run fine as long as x is a kind of at or at otherwise or no your you protect yourself by using a comb of and object x code code code instanceof else if instanceof misslecontroller else if something else protected against the but got the responsibility of doing something sensible at the now imagine you make a change to the so that can take the types and you now must go through all the code and find all the instances of that comb and modify now the code is changes in the requirements mean lots of code in striving to make the code less oo solution is to use polymorphism which you can think of as a kind of limited duck defining all the operations that something can be trusted to you do this by defining a superior probably that has all the methods of the inferior in a class like that is best expressed an but it has all the type properties of a in you can see an interface as being a promise that a particular class can be trusted to act it were another public interface veeblefeetzer public class fooddispenser implements veeblefeetzer public class misslecontroller implements veeblefeetzer public class floorwax implements veeblefeetzer public class desserttopping implements veeblefeetzer you have to do now is use a reference to a and the figures it out for if you happen to add another class a subtype of the compiler will select the method and check the arguments in the a reference to anything that implements some code that assigns something to some more	
 you say below have you added the tbr to the if not that would be the reason it be	
 you say it builds fine through visual studio by do you mean on the same if so then it probably is the fact that your cruisecontrol service is running as a different and as has differnt paths and environment variables maybe it does not have permissions to access the file system these dependencies are if you mean it runs fine on a different then i would make sure that those dependencies actually there and that the user the service runs as has permissions to get to we have never encountered these so i am just trying to guess at a few potential setting up	
 you say my system floating point numbers are stored with a comma as the decimal assume you mean that they are with a floating point numbers are stored as you can tackle the formatting issue by setting cultures the fix is to change the not your code so maybe you want to do that on this but for general reference you need to ensure that when formatting floats or anything else you use the appropriate in the case of fomatting a number for use by an api you would use the use instead of and likewise when using just taken a look at the nerddinner code and have realised that this error is in the javascript not in so my code above going to i know if it is possible to format numbers in but the real solution i think is to fix the model code to return a correctly formatted suggest you try the the change the and in to class jsondinner public int dinnerid public string title public string latitude public string longitude public string description public int rsvpcount scroll down to the searchbylocation method and change the lines to format the strings correctly for should mean that you do not need the fix you put and should fix your other where i will leave a hope this i fully tested is as i am not in your but it certainly appears to	
 you saying that they want to do text if the they will ruin the ability to do meaningful reporting on the because i can guarantee that they will not consistently enter the they are going to be entering one of several preset strings grades of then make a lookup table for those strings which maps to numeric values for they really want to be able to start entering in text and you dissuade them from add another column along the lines of have a predefined value that means to put in your value that when doing reporting you can either roll up all of those random values or you can simply ignore make sure that you add the into your systemcodes table so that you can keep a foreign key between that and the results if you already have then you should definitely consider adding

 you set up a tcp the has to be unique this is to ensure packets are delivered to the right is a further restriction on the side that only one server program can bind to an incoming port number one ip servers have other powers but we need to discuss them at the server a that socket to a on that connections on that there can be multiple connections coming in per the client usually a little a the a client opens the it specifies the ip address and port of the it specify its source port but usually uses zero which results in the system assigning it a free port is requirement that the destination be unique since that would result in only one person at a time being able to use and that would pretty well destroy their business means you can even do such wondrous things as ftp since you set up multiple sessions where the only difference is your source allowing you to download chunks in torrents are a little different in that the destination of each session is usually after all that waffling the answer to your specific question is that you need to specify a free if connecting to a server with a call that specify your source almost certainly be using zero under the covers and the system will give you an unused

 you want the user to change the virtual directory you can simply remove the dialog from the user click installer project the click on you want different parameters for the web virtual application pool that is normally selected by the installation address dialog you can override with a custom action as others have in my experience custom actions do not help with setting defaults that the user can change because they execute the dialogs that ask for user easiest way to set some defaults that the user can override if necessary in a dialog is to do the the welcome a textboxes dialog example visible properties for all the textboxes to false so no textboxes are the bannerbitmap and bodytext property so it looks somewhat like a the necessary properties you want to override in the set the default value in the most useful properties where the files are to be the virtual directory to be created in the specified the application pool to use this must it be the website where the virtual directory is to be created this is the for the web for also note that the site must is a full list of properties for the installer can be found you really want better control over the iis setup i would suggest changing your project to a standard windows installer project and creating custom install actions so that you can programatically create a good place to start to understand programmaticly creating these things is biggest reason for doing it this way is that custom actions run prompting but the app pool and web sites must be created the installer can

 you want to mess with the more traditional way to do this sort of thing with web forms is to use a panel control for each of the and then hide or reveal the various panels on not as fun or cool as the ajax but if really just a simple little wizard then this is a quick and easy way to do web form might look something like page html public xhtml page viewstate will manage the value of your which you can then access in the to implement your business logic as you hide and reveal the for public partial class protected void eventargs validate controls according to business hide and reveal panels based on the currently visible if else if and so

 you will want to know the ip address of someone visiting your while has several ways to do this one of the best ways seen is by using the of the servervariables your visitors are behind either a proxy server or a router and the standard only captures the ip address of the proxy server or when this is the case the ip address is then stored in the server variable what we want to do is first check and if that is empty we then simply return this method is not it can lead to better below is the code in taken from blog post returns multiple ip string context string ipaddress if addresses if return return shared function as dim context as dim sipaddress as string if return dim iparray as new return end	
 you will write that do important for any realistic interaction with the for if a string field has a constraint that it must always be then at least one of your methods must make a call to or and in your class you probably want to use this to make sure that the constraint is there will also be times when you need to circumvent that preprocessing in i have seen times when developers inadvertently create infinite loops by using the public property rather than the private field think of an example off the top of my to sql generated classes are a good i because they show how much logic can exist in a try writing some extension methods and begin to understand the think the bottom line is that it depends on what kind of logic you are using at any given point in the and what kind of preprocessing exists in the if you are ever unsure or it seems like it it is probably better to use the property so that you write more maintainable code that will follow constraints added	
 you wish to do the primary calculation in you will need some sort of big integer implementation like for programming is about using the right tool for the right if you cannot find a good big integer library for not against the rules to calculate the number in a language like python which already has the ability to calculate large you could then put this number into your program via your method of and iterate over each character in the number will have to store it as a for each convert it to an integer and add it to your total until you reach the end of the if you would like the big i calculated it with python the answer is further val total for i in total print

 your problem is dependency injection inversion of your goal should be to inject your implementation of instead of monkeypatching and this approach requires some changes to your existing design but for the right reasons your favorite design principle especially the same object should not be responsible for both creating and using other assume the way using looks somewhat like class otherclass public void someclass sc object o some more stuff what you should do is first create your class that implements the same interface or extends and then pass that instance to so your class becomes agnostic to implementation of in this case the code that calls is responsible for passing in the correct implementation whether be the actual or your monkeypatched class extends someclass public object your monkeypatched implementation goes class otherclass public void object o some more stuff
