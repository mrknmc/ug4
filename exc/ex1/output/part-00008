15 years old and i want to learn how to program i like to think more experienced with computers than the average i use the command prompt every day and i know how to access the command line in the command prompt but i have no idea what programs i should start with and what language to would i be better off downloading a language or using one of the programs on my computer like the command line or any help would be downloaded this morning and already wrote two they were small console programs but learning fast and getting familiar with the any advice would be should i go about learning to write	
1992 to 1993 timeframe was pivotal and fateful for the time frame i worked on a plugin architecture for aldus which was coded in pagemaker was built on a oop framework called which assisted its portability between mac os and we tried to use the features of to build a plugin this proved to be very problematic for classes due to the brittle base class proceeded to write a paper that was published in journals and that i presented at oopsla in a reflection you can read the pdf format of the paper i presented invariant virtual member function dispatching for evolvable to the bottom and click or also made contact with bjarne stroustrup at a usenix conference in portland and proceeded to dialog with him for several where he championed the issue of dealing with the brittle base class problem on my other issues were deemed more important at that time for trying to shepard rtti through at this time introduced the system for the windows platform that was looked on as a viable solution to the could be used as an implementation language for com via abstract classes used to define com these days developers shun and especially that was based on 1994 i went on to work at microsoft and used and there for the remainder of the i came to conclude that the technology combination was a definite i refer to that experience effective enterprise distributed software contrast to all this early steve devised a plugin architecture using objective c during the early and that was integral to the next step today that lives on vibrantly in mac os x on computers and important platforms such as the submit objective c enabled solving the plugin problem in a superior champions of java will cite factors such as garbage collection as to why it is more productive than i dispute but objective c has not had garbage collection until very recently with on the iphone garbage collection is still not the os x plugin architecture has been entirely viable due entirely to the merits of objective c style of oop vs java has been used to build the most pervasive plugin architectures that exist for any platform or software development the eclipse ide plugin which by now is practically as such architectures incorporated a few years ago the equinox osgi module management j2ee app servers have supported a for ejbs for a these days all j2ee app servers of note have likewise incorporated osgi to manage runtime bindable the spring framework and its runtime bindable unit of the spring bean has grown to exceed j2ee primarily on the strength of its system for managing the binding in of the spring java community is still struggling to define an official module management standard yet even as things the java platform supports software architectures that incorporate plugin capability more pervasively than any other programming the weaknesses of java as a language relative to and that already has a stronger module implementation in its assembly java is still light years ahead in terms of everyday software systems in wide use that incorporate some form of plugin the java community even consciously realize that this is the underpinning of their continued success as an enterprise development personally regard the brittle base class problem of to be most fatal 17 years have passed since this issue was highlighted to the and to the creator of is it now too late to address 17 years is it too late to fix runtime

5 is almost completely backwards compatible with java the only change you make when you migrate is to rename any usages of the new keyword in the java 4 full list of potential compatibility problems is listed only other one that run into in practice is related to the change in the jaxp in our it simply meant removing from the far as refactoring i think that migrating your collection classes to use the new generic versions and removing unnecessary casting is a good but as another poster pointed changing to generic collections tends to work best if you work in vertical you end up having to add casting to the code to make the generic types compatible with the feature i like to use when migrating code is the it helps to catch inheritance problems when refactoring new concurrency library is very useful if your code uses for you may be able to replace thread pools with a would definitely take the approach of updating the code as you change it during normal other than the compatibility i think there is a compelling reason to use the new java 5 features unless already changing the code for other

a 25 element array of pointers to a pointer to char is generally considered a so this declaration could be interpreted as an array of but the memory for storing those strings does not exist you would have to allocate those string pointers are 4 bytes on your this line would have the effect of allocating 25 x 4 100 when you use an array name without a it into a pointer to the first element of the when this line is points to 100 bytes of enough room enough to hold 100 characters that are read in 99 characters plus a terminating nul the compiler is not protecting you from storing those characters in the memory that was allocated for 25 passing the starting address of the array to the function the compiler knows this is probably wrong since is supposed to take a pointer to not at pointer to an array of char but it lets you do it anyway except for the the statement in reinterprets that pointer as a char and you get the correct others have it would be correct to change the one line to declares an array of 25

a codebase in which one particular text string occurs the string may be some kind of message for or an xml tag of these examples are usually accompanied by another repeated representing the message footer or the closing as the codebase you notice the string popping up more and more until the bell goes what to turns out all been taught the create a manifest constant or a static final string or depending on the thereby giving the common string a and replace all instances of the string by use of the even a name for this refactoring in martin replace magic number with symbolic duplication duplication in the repeated text of the but in the repeated use of the the resulting code still contains the original by hiding the string behind a my feeling is that made the code less readable right approach after using inline constant to put the original strings back into the code is to look at the context in which each of those strings chances are there will be only a small number of kinds of use of the string perhaps every time a reply message is for if the message has a header and a for look for ways to create an object that builds the with a hook to a function that supplies the message ninety percent of the time that kind of approach but on the odd occasion when it look for ways to encapsulate the string in a simple and then push the surrounding code onto that in either case the result after is that the string is present inline in the but the behavioural context in which that string exists now has a name hopefully a name that is also meaningful in the domain and the domain knowledge or policy represented by the associated code is no longer

a common mistake to think of as a functional really it is best thought of as a family of but these days when people say lisp they usually mean common lisp allows functional but it a functional language per rather it is a general purpose scheme is a much smaller that is more functional in and of course there are for your question is it a good that really depends on your common lisp particularly has some real strengths for this sort of both interactive and introspective at a level you usually see in scripting making it very quick to develop at the same time its compiled and has efficient so you can expect performance in the same ballpark as other efficient compilers a factor of two of c is typical while a large it has a much more consistent design than things like and the metaprogramming capabilities can make very easy to understand code for your particular if you only look at these lisp looks there are the community is you find many people to help if what looking while the built in library is you find as many 3rd party so you may end up writing more of it from while by no means a walled cl have the kind of smooth integration with foreign libraries that say python which mean you call c there are nice tools for they clos is about the most powerful oo system i can think but it is quite a different approach if coming from a mainstream oo background they but beyond single multiple not that you may find it a bit strange at almost turned inside you go this you are going to have to watch for some issues with performance of the actual rendering if you write that yourself with the class system has incredible runtime flexibility updating class definitions at runtime not via monkey patching but via actually changing the class and updating however you pay some dispatch cost on what used cl in the past for research code requiring numerical simulations of a different it works well for in that case i worried about using existing code it so i was writing pretty much everything from scratch it could be a fine choice of language for this but not the only if you use a language with both aspects and good performance cl as does and a few i would definitely look at the possibility of a two level approach with a language like lua or perhaps python of on top of some c or code doing the heavy

a line of code in language that line is written once and likely to be read many more times potentially of so proficiency in a language in large reading for a corpus of programs written in how quickly can you read the programs and understand what they are of the available i think since there is an arbitrary number of commonly used libraries that are created while you are learning even the libraries for many languages today have thousands of distinct concepts and tens of thousands of how the features of the language are a property of a given implementation of the language rather than the language but i think it does knowing that regular expressions are often implemented as state machines knowing the theory for is pretty relevant to understanding of regular expression though knowing how java byte code works has never had any relevance in java applications worked i guess some languages have a cleaner separation from their possible implementations than this may be a key difference between high and low level you have a particular language in a good test is to look at serious examples in for the case of reading the linux gnu os postgresql or and out how they is not only an indication but can be good there was that one assignment about static analysis of but the actual solution could have been written in

a little we have an intranet site based on wss that is hosted on a server in and set up to use integrated windows authentication to authenticate users against active directory user accounts of setup works just fine for users who are logged into windows using an ad account from but when users try to access the site from a pc logged into windows using an ad account from a different domain the following problems user must manually enter their credentials as rather than just because internet explorer automatically inserts and causes authentication to logged if the user does something that requires the browser to pass their authentication through to a client such as clicking on a microsoft office document in a document library in order to open it for it appears that invalid credentials are passed thus forcing the user to manually enter their credentials then is there any way to implement a type of behavior when using integrated windows authentication can be done when using basic clear text so that if a user on does not enter a domain before their user is inserted automatically for i realize this deployment may be fatally so i am also open to suggestions for a different the main problem stems from two different kinds of users needing to access the same content on one sharepoint the users in all have their own workstations where they log into windows as the users in unfortunately have to use shared computers that are logged on using generic type accounts that have no permissions in sharepoint thus the requirement that the users must provide their credentials on demand when accessing a given page in i would like to preserve the convenience of the integrated windows authentication for the users of while minimizing the amount of manual authentication that the users in have to authentication across multiple	
a look at and see if it it talks about the seh underpinnings of the exception you are asking does calling methods with parameters and return values work in something like and then look at a really low level i am thinking you are when you make a call to a you push your params onto the then run the then pop the return value of the stack into a and then process off of like the from method pop value off stack and store it in the eax register esx if the eax register is jump to this the case of an the managed framework starts to unwind the stack one step at a time looking for a or block that can handle the it keeps doing this until it finds some block of code that can handle it or it runs out of code and just terminates the to understand how all this works at a stack level depends on which managed framework you are talking but the first article above combined with will give you the deeper

a solution really but since you asked for advise against doing your own parsing you want to learn how to write a complex as you not all spaces should be there are not only cdata blocks but also elements with the which correspond to things like in xhtml the enclosed whitespaces actually have and writing a parser that is able to recognize those elements and leave the whitespace alone would be possible but would go with the parsing load the document and go printing them that way you can easily identify which nodes you can strip the spaces out of and which you there are some modules in the python standard none of which i have ever used that could be useful to try or not sure if you could do this with

absolutely it is just compiler glue to prevent you from doing something in the caller is responsible for maintaining the stack so the cast is necessary when you invoke the function arguments and the return value are pushed onto the this makes it since the stack will not likely be mutated the invoked function can still mess up the stack in certain rare should clarify that the assignment copies the function but in all function pointers are just the type and casting is all compiler the standard specifies that the behavior is undefined if the caller uses incompatible for casting a function which returns void into one which returns an int and then calling that the value is a good idea to cast the function into a compatible type before calling or you may see unexpected

address the question posed by your most recent is the current but the time the start of the current psycopg2 is probably starting a transaction implicitly for and since the transaction is never closed a commit or the timestamp gets and becomes frequently if only doing up psycopg2 to use different behavior for automatically creating transactions tricky to get and affect other parts of your a different timestamp like but otherwise perfect for this section emphasis provides a number functions that return values to the current date and functions all values based on the start time of current and deliver values with time and deliver values without time and optionally be given a which causes the result be rounded to that many digits in the seconds without precision the result given to the full available functions return start time of the current their values do not change during this is considered the intent is to allow single transaction to have consistent notion of the so that multiple within the same transaction bear same time other database systems might advance these values more also provides that return the start time of current as well as actual current time at the instant function is the complete of time functions is a traditional equivalent to is equivalent to is named to clearly reflect what returns the start time of the statement the of receipt of the latest message from the return same value during the first command a but might differ subsequent returns the current and therefore its changes even within a single is a postgresql it returns actual current but as formatted text string rather than timestamp with time zone	
addresses are part of the network layer in the the network layer can do whatever it wants to do with the ip what happens with a proxy or application layer should not depend on the ip address in any in an ip address is not meant to be an identifier of anything other than the idenfitier of one end of a network as soon as a connection is you should expect the ip address the same to

advice is sound if you are you need to worry about freeing the memory since the system will reclaim it exception to that is shared memory segments at least under system v shared those segments can persist longer than the program that creates option not mentioned so far is to use an memory allocation built on top of standard if the entire application uses a single your cleanup code can release that and all is freed at apache portable runtime provides a pools feature which i believe is david interfaces and provides an memory allocation written one that you could use if you wanted you can think of this as garbage a general memory every time you allocate memory you should understand which code is going to release it and when it can be there are a few standard the simplest is in this released before this function this keeps the memory largely under control you run too many iterations on the loop that contains the memory and scopes it so that it can be made available to the current function and the functions it you have to be reasonably sure that the functions you call are not going to squirrel away pointers to the data and try to reuse them later after released and reused the next standard pattern is exemplified by and a function that allocates a pointer to some which can be used by the calling and then released when the program has finished with this often becomes very similar to the first case it is usually a good idea to call in the function that called of the remaining are somewhat

all of the code in classic text the c programming second edition can be compiled using a standard compilers like gcc if your c code is upto the standards followed in that classic then good enough ready to compile your c code using a the instance of linux kernel source code which is mostly written in c with some inline assembler a nightmare compiling the linux kernel code with a because of least possible reason that is being used as an variable name in linux kernel where as allow the usage of as a variable i am just giving one example remember that linux kernel is portable compiles runs very well in sparc etc this is just to illustrate that portability does have different meanings in software if you want to compile c code using a you are migrating your code base from c to i see it as two different programming languages for most obvious reason that c programmers like but i like both of them i use both of them a your c code is but you should make sure you follow standard techniques to have your code portable while you migrate your c code to read on to see from where get the standard have to be very careful porting the c code to code the next question that ask why would you bother to do that if some piece of c code is portable running well without any i accept again linux kernel a big code source in c is being managed very see the two programming languages c as different programming though does support c its basic notion is to always support for that wonderful language for backward if not looking at these two languages as different then you fall under the land of ugly programming language wars make yourself the following rules when choosing does your code or need to be compiled on different architectures possibly using native do a study of compilers on the different architectures that you wish to run your program plan for code invest good time on as far as possible try to provide a clean layer of separation between c code if your c code is you just need to write wrappers around that portable c code again using portable coding to some good books on how to write portable i personally recommend the programming language by bjarne stroustrup effective series from scott meyers popular ddj articles out there in linux kernel example in my post is just to illustrate that portability does mean different meanings in software programming criticize that linux kernel is written in c not in

all successful software projects ever been on have been released published web with a fair amount of betas in mainly evaluate the of these open source and the previous track record for not doing stupid old beta will do as long as it does what we need but usually we stay off the immediate snapshots after major days test so we know if stuff if the libraries have bugs we stay with an older version or fix the we can also assess immediately if an update has serious bugs in because it will break our own so using software is really not a big deal any access to the latest features is always the sometimes we do it to get important

also a big fan of using process of ruling out variables tremendously simplifies the debugging often the very first thing that should to be really effective technique is to roll back to your last working version if possible and try this can be extremely powerful because it gives you solid footing to proceed more a variation on this is to get the code to a point where it is with less than not working with more very important to not just try this increases your despair because it never rather make 50 runs to gather information about the bug rather take a wild swing and hope it

also needs to be careful that changing from operators introduce an undesirable side for if iterating over a loop 5 times simply to run a set of code multiple times without any interest in the loop index probably okay on the other hand if you do access the loop index value than the result may not be what you for int i i i for int i i i for int i i for int i i in the first two cases show no but notice that attempting to the fourth case by switching to a operator would result in an iteration being completely admittedly this is a bit of a contrived case but i have seen this sort of loop iteration when going through an array in reverse from end to

alternative to representing the digits as a sequence of integers is to represent the number base as a list of 32 bit which is what many big integer libraries you then have to convert the number to base 10 for this gain you very much for this particular problem you can write straight then have to divide by 10 many times instead of multiplying 2 by itself 1000 times as 1000 is calculating the product of using repeated squaring which requires more space and a multiplication but is far fewer operations is closer to normal big integer so you may find it more useful in later problems if you try to calculate the last ten digits of using the int method and repeated it may take some time in that case you could use modulo rather than adding strings of millions of

am not sure why this question was down i think a great one thing to google and read some random websites which a lot of times are trying to sell you something rather than to be and another thing to ask so crowd which are mangers to share their and what works or work for their that this point is out of the i am sure a lot of developers will point you towards keep in mind that these terms are often used very loosely especially i am probably going to sound very controversial by saying this which is not my but these methodologies are especially scrum which is more of a product being marketed by scrum consultants than having said at the end of a you got to use what works the best for you and your if or go for at the same time you need to be flexible about become religious about any or if something is not working for or you can get more efficient by changing go for be more specific regarding your the basic summary of techniques that have been working for me lot of these are common all the and emails pertaining to a specific and make it accessible to others through a central location use ms onenote 2007 and love it for all my and bug meetings you should try to should be followed by action items where each item is assigned to a specific any verbal agreement should be put into a written all documents added to the project onenote in my starting any new have a written document of what the system will be capable of doing what it wont commit to but be flexible to business how detailed the document should detailed enough so that everyone understands what the final system will be capable are but be realistic and to yourself and business the basic guideline that i release and software that lacks some rather than a buggy software with all the open lines of communication among your team and between your developers and business but at the end of a one person a few key should be responsible for making key test where it makes but do not become obsessive about code coverage no and software works correctly according to the have code and code commit to but if it does not work for some situations allow for your code especially hard to but make it into a back and clean up you code if you already working on that implementing new working on a bug fix but refactor it just for the sake of unless you have nothing else to do and the last and more important not become religious about any specific methodology or borrow the best aspects from and find the balance that works for you and your

am reading the problem as server gets messages from client 1 and 2 and forwards clients are different meaning the messages they are sending could potentially be what you want is the messages from the clients to be sent alteratively out from your but not to if a client has this i suggest that you have two queues and in your will have to read from the sockets in two seperate and when a message comes in add it to its corresponding client1queue client2queue in a third have the server forward the alternating pulling these messages from client1queue and solve your problem of if the queue is empty simply skip that this insures sending all messages at the fastest possible rate while still getting all the messages the downside is that it only alternates if a message is ready to be you of have it wait for x amount to see if a message comes for the other but i see why you would want to if the system is supposed to work regardless of the client

am starting to explore linq to objects but want to know how application design can best accommodate linq to an example an application displays female employees only and the employee table in the database contains data for both male and female the application builds a sql statement to retrieve only the female employees from the database and places them into an object which is then passed around the application for display get the greatest leverage from linq to i assume you would first have to obtain all the data for employees and then apply linq to filter the object to only display the female the benefit is that you can continue to query the employees without touching the database is a basic example but the point i am trying to make is where does the line between benefit and efficient execution time if the employee table has can see the benefit of linq but in my i am convinced that you first need to put all the data into an object from which you can then use linq to all the data may be too costly to make it worthwhile when i can just query the database again each time i need a different subset of to objects philosophy of

am trying to become a good programming citizen through learning more about dependency injection ioc and other for this i have a project where i am trying to make the right choices and design everything in the whatever that might moq and mvc help with testability and getting the app the i have a question about how to design an entity base class for the objects that my application consists i have a simple class library which the web app is built on top this library exposes a irepository and the default implementation one that the app uses under the covers datacontext is not exposed to the web and simply contains ways to fetch these the repository basically looks like this interface where t t where t default implementation uses the method on the datacontext to provide the correct this requires that the base class has some it is easy enough to get my objects to inherit from it by creating a partial class of the same name as the mapped object that gives but what is the way to do the interface above has a function for getting an entity by id all the different kinds of classes that derives from entity does indeed have an field of type int from the primary key of their respective but how can i specify this in a way that lets me implement irepository like class concreterepository private somedatacontext db new public where t return public t where t return am doing this from memory on a pc so forgive any you hopefully get my trick here is of course that for this to it has to be known for sure that entity promises that everyone that derives from it has an id i can make an abstract or a normal field that is by the id field that sticks in the generated this all feels kind of like a and even gives compiler really be interface and i should try to make the id field be defined in a way that will this would also make it easy to specify other interfaces that need to should be an abstract base class with an abstract id and should it also implement needed interfaces in an abstract way for others to know well enough to see an elegant solution to so i would love to hear from more experienced system designers with some base class experience weigh in on april see i left out something important my irepository has two concrete implementations one that is the one using linq to the other one is a inmemoryrepository that just uses a list for which is used for unit testing two solutions added will both work for one of these not for the so if i would need a way to define that everything that inherits from entity will have the and that this will work with the linq to sql datacontext without base class design in for repository

answer is much more simpler than is you echo those vars running as because you already exit confusion by adding more debug for use a single echo that contains relevant to your problem process user export while sudo do sudo sudo this is key the exit commented out you get what you expect in the as the one the one running as never reaches that part of the code that exports sometimes running scripts in helps too

answer your first is performing the convolution of a with the reverse of v and giving the results clipped by the specified because of the of the correlation sum for i inf of where t even though this definition of the correlation would allow for results from to you obviously store an infinitely long so it has to be and that is where the mode comes there are 3 different mode returns results for every t where both a and v have some mode returns a result with the same length as the shortest vector or mode returns results only when a and v completely overlap each the documentation for gives more detail on the your second i think giving you the it is just giving you a little more as the autocorrelation is used to find how similar a or is to itself at a certain time at a time difference of the should be the highest because the signal is identical to so you expected that the first element in the result array would be the the correlation is not starting at a time difference of it starts at a negative time closes to and then goes that you were sum for i inf where 0 t what you got sum for i inf where t you need to do is take the last half of your correlation and that should be the you are looking a simple python function to do that would result return of need error checking to make sure that x is actually a this explanation probably the most mathematically been throwing around infinities because the definition of convolution uses but that necessarily apply for the theoretical portion of this explanation may be slightly but hopefully the practical results are on are pretty and can give you a much better theoretical background if you mind wading through the notation and heavy	
answer your last two by no memory leaks in managed there are two kinds of leaks that can are released when no references to the object are if you still have a reference to an it will not be this happens for instance when you throw away a reference to an object that has registered for an event if you manually unregister the event handler use a weak the event will still reference the so it will not be released although you have no obvious reference to it resources can be a wrapper for unmanaged resources implements idisposable and will free the resource when you call if you just throw away the it will not release the resource and therefore leak two rules of thumb any event handler when you release an or use a weak reference for that on explained a class exposes a dispose call if you use the object only use the using if you have members that implement implement idisposable yourself and call the dispose in your	
answer your question as to what is actually going i try to foreach an questions block i get an object not collection each enumerates a set of variants from the source it does this by acquiring an if the source variable holds an object it is expected to have an implementation of this if it is an array vbscript creates an implementation dynamically and it can only do this if the array has been anything else in the source variable as empty in this will result in an the assignment fails with a type mismatch left hand side of an assignment operation must always be a hence its not possible copy the contents of one dynamic array to another via a simple first approach is reasonably sound but you need a way to represent an empty array without crashing out a for you can use this little public public public private sub questions end if you try to for each the questions before it has been assigned a real array the for each will do nothing as also if you use 1 to get the count of questions that will still be accurate since is

approach to work around this is to use the scriptignore attribute and create a partial class for the object in up the entitystate properties and adding a scriptignore attribute to partial class public new entitykey public new entitystate the person class is serialized via it will ignore those this would not be practical because ef uses the state info to keep track of objects and this would wreak there were a way to dynamically add it would eliminate the need to override those properties just to add a since there is no way to dynamically add this solution may not be that

approached the problem by converting the data into an easier i created a table where each row represents one minute of a once you have that the average per minute by hour is there are multiple selects in there to show the intermediate as long as the time range being queried and the durations extremely it should be table seconds date dur system port is an the difference of seconds from utc to the current utc we use it as an identifier is the the call was is the day the call was is the duration of the call in is the system is the port on the system particularly relevant for this into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into convert date into datetimes as as end date to the minute as as from order by create a row for each minute of each call table seconds system minute from insert into select from where from order by concurrent per minute as by avg concurrent per minute by hour as as as from group table table table last select hour	
are 3 options for creating a chat and sockets for the frontend and a programming language for the for the recommend java or because they are multithreading and possible to do it with php php really do efficient multithreading and is generally not really suited for this is an option if you need high and probably not what looking ajax and this case all clients are constantly example ever 2 polling if something new has it feels strange because you only get responses at those it puts quite a strain on your server and you know an application uses this technique because the browser constantly this is a suboptimal ajax and works with and has long running scripts in the not the best but most of the time better than pulling and it works and is used in several well known chat this technique is sometimes called if you need a chat app for production install an existing programming chat applications is not you just want to learn start with a simple then try to program one using ajax and most probably need a tough i successfully implemented a very simple solution that works with text files for fun i certainly use it in is my but pretty not possible to create a chat app without a backend just frontend javascript you want to know how the data pushing is look at the source async multipart is what you want var httpreq new sync multipart sync wait until data false null event if 4 else error is called data not just once like in regular not using jquery or prototype so the a bit obese this is really old the server side 1 print print print print first part of request print 3 print print print second part of request print the if got a architecture like in the you need kind of external storage like databases or you could rely on memory by writing your own http server with but not recommend it for serious not really but probably a bit out of the scope of your question made a got everything mixed because been a long time i actually did something like here are the responses only work with mozilla browsers and therefore are of limited comet mean traditional singlepart but held an infinite loop and until there is data so the browser has 1 for every action the worst not one request every x even if nothing	
are a couple of features mono has that is highly you can break it apart in tiny little pieces and only deploy those parts that you want is you can host it inside your to allow users to script it from a safe managed sandboxed the most famous example of this is which hosts mono inside the apache and is how is implemented in for this feature goes great together with the modularization mentioned has already been static goes great together with as a service is another anders hejlsberg has been talking about it for a and just maybe it is going to be ready for mono already has and actually had it for de lead developer also has an initiative that he calls and which extends the cli in ways not possible with other cli implementations so embrace and has three which gives safe and controlled access to the simd instructions of the underlying cpu sse on intel or altivec on used for games and bit array which are allowed by the ecma but mono is the only vm that actually provides used in most this is actually the first time that mono strays outside the realm of the long array indices are perfectly valid as per the and also works on every cli compliant implementation but needs special support from the vm that is not part of either cli or this is used for game logic and in second

are a lot of comments arguing the pros and cons of mvvm for i agree with a matter of using the pattern appropriately and mvvm always people seems to have become willing to sacrifice all of the most important principles of software design just to get it to fit think your case could be a good fit with a bit of most cases come wpf enables you to get by without multiple maybe you could try using and instead of windows with your case my suggestion would be have handle the and if the login is set a property on to an appropriate value or some enum value like do the same for a successful login or some other enum then use a which responds to the various user authentication states and could use a simple to change the property of the your login window return a i think is where getting that is really a property of your in admittedly limited experience with when something feel right it usually because thinking in terms of how i done the same thing in that

are in the process of doing exactly three years ago i joined the development team on a project with no unit almost no code and a fairly build code base consists of a set of com components oracle data cartridge and some java all using a core some of the code is nearly a decade first step was adding some unit the behaviour is very so there was some initial effort in generating a unit test framework now extended to other modules with junit and which uses test data from a most of the initial tests were functional tests which excercised the outermost layers and not really unit you will probably have to expend some effort you may need to budget to implement a test find it helps a lot if you make the cost of adding unit tests as low as the test framework made it relatively easy to add tests when fixing bugs in existing new code can have proper unit as you refactor and implementn new areas of code you can add proper unit tests which test much smaller areas of the last year we have added continuous integration with cruisecontrol and automated our build this adds much more incentive to keep tests and which was a big problem in the early so i would recommend that you include regular least unit test runs as part of your development have recently focussed on improving our code review which was fairly infrequent and the intent is to make it much cheaper to initiate and perform a code review so that developers are encouraged to do them more also as part of our process improvement i am trying to get time for code reviews and unit tests included in project planning at a much lower level in a way that ensures individual developers have to think more about whereas previously there was just a fixed proportion of time devoted to them that was much easier to get lost in the

are really 2 types of static that are static because they can that are static because they have to a small to medium size code base you can really treat the two methods you have a method that is in the first category and you need to change it to access class relatively straight forward to figure out if possible to turn the static method into a instance a large code the sheer number of call sites might make searching to see if possible to convert a static method to a non static one too many times people will see the number of and say i better not change this but instead create a new one that does what i can result in lot of code explosion in the number of method of those things are my advice would be that if you have a code base over 200k that i would only make methods static if they are refactoring from to static is relatively easy add a so if you want to make a into an actual static later you need functionality outside of an then you the inverse turning a into a instance method is much more large code bases better to error on the side of ease of rather than on the side of idealogical for big projects make things static unless you need them to for small just do what ever you like

are some general steps that will get you on your you must change your settings so that it creates pdb even for release later versions of the compiler do this by but in many versions of visual you must do this create program database and then keep an archive of those files along with each build of your it is critical that every build of your applications has its own set of you just reuse the same ones you made with build 10 to examing the dumps generated by build for over the life of your you will end up with a ton of so be prepared for you need to be able to identify the exact version of your application which generated the dump if you are creating your own minidumps calling for probably the easiest way to do this is to simply make part of the filename of the minidump the complete version number of your need to have a reasonable version numbering scheme in place for this to in my we increment the build number across all branches by one every time the autobuilder creates a that you have recieved the dump file from the you know the precise version of the application that created the and you have found the pdb files for this you need to go through your source history and find the source code for this exact version of the the best way to do this is to apply to your branches every time you make a set the value of the label to the exact version and it becomes easy to find in the almost ready to fire up the complete source tree for that version of your put it in a seperate place on your hard say for application version build the binaries for that exact version of your application and put them somewhere on your hard it might be easiest simply to install that version of your application to get the the pdb files in the same location as the binaries in step you have two options for viewing the dump you can use or using visual studio is but windbg is much more most of the time the functionality in visual studio will use visual all you have to do is open the dump file like it is a once the dump file by and if all the paths are set correctly it will take you right to the code that give you a call use you have to jump through a couple of the dump by windbg to go get the correct microsoft symbol type this may take a few moments as it will pull a ton of stuff down from the windbg where the symbols type substituting wherever you put the pdb files for the make sure you get the plus sign in there with no whitespace between and the sign or else screw up step windbg where the source code type substituting the path where you got code from source control for this version of the windbg to analyze the dump type a few if everything is configured windbg will take you right to the location of your at this point you have a million options for digging deep into your memory the state of critical but that is beyond the scope of this

are the best less resource ways to pass relationships from a db server to a that i have a author table and a book i want to to retrieve all the authors whose name starts with and all the books generate an array of objects whose field is an array of objects poor man solutions that come to my mind all the cycle through them on the client and execute an additional query to get all the from author book b where like and first solution is really intensive i have 1000 i have to execute 1001 second requires some intensive work as the program would parse the result as it has the data common to author repeated on each solution would be to return multiple record sets from a stored never handled multiple record sets and not sure that all the languages adaptor classes support course the situation can get worse if any author can have books essays and every book can have sample pages and so using so datarelations are an are they supported my oracle and is the best way to handle record	
are the best practices for ensuring that your sql can be run repeatedly without receiving errors on subsequent that tables already exist before creating them that columns already exist before creating or renaming with rollback on you drop tables that exist before creating them drop their dependencies first and forget to recreate them create or alter procedure instead of create procedure or alter procedure if your flavor of sql supports an internal versioning so the same sql just get run twice in the first this way you always know where at by looking at the version the existing data to insert statements and completely recreate the entire db from tables before creating them the safest thing but will work in a pinch if you know what was looking for something like exists select from where and 1 table others use statements like this or something like is not null drop table do this for adding not exists select from syscolumns where exists select from where name like and id and alter table add sql server

assuming you want to still see stderr and stdout on the you could go for josh but i find keeping a around in the background which outputs your log file very hackish and notice how you need to keep an exra fd and do cleanup afterward by killing it and technically should be doing that in a is a better way to do and already discovered instead of just using it for your have a tee for stdout and one for how will you accomplish process substitution and file split it up and creates a fifo and lets listen on it uses to redirect the stdout of to the fifo that your first is listening thing for the use process substitution again to make a process that reads from stdin and dumps it into outputs its input back on but since its input is our we want to redirect stdout to our stderr then we use file redirection to redirect stderr to the input substitution is one of those really lovely things you get as a bonus of choosing as your shell as opposed to or have to do things

been programming with but not masochistic enough to love still way too easy to get between no matter how much of a you plus whatever help you get from threads are easy to but very difficult to do so of course gravitates to is all that of good old is still a good way to go for many the overhead is not too bad need to measure that to back up my bs some particularly if you are forking an then generating a bunch of task specific data in the child child processes are hideously expensive on so the erlang approach is looking pretty force joe schmoe to write pure functions and use message passing instead of his automata global variable with bonus thread not bitter comment elsewhere about i had been thinking about this quite a bit recently as garbage collection really hurts the aspect of running gc on 0 wait state ram on an old 80286 may have seemed but it really hurts on caching maybe referencing counting such a bad idea as a gc implementation in some i put some effort into backing up my talk here	
been reading a lot lately about the next release of java possibly supporting i feel like i have a pretty firm grasp on what closures but i think of a solid example of how they would make an language most people who use the term actually mean and in this function objects make it possible to write simpler code in certain circumstances such as when you need custom comparators in a sort in return y sorts the list a in reverse order by passing the custom comparison functoin the addition of the lambda operator makes things even more y y does not have function so it uses to simulate in java you do the equivalent operation by implementing a custom version of the comparator and passing that to the sort reversecomparator implements comparator public object return y a new you can it gives the same effect as but is clumsier and more the addition of anonymous inner classes obviates most of the a reverse new public object return y i would say that the combination of functor classes anonymous inner classes in java is sufficient to compensate for the lack of true function making their addition	
been reading about the various forms and aspects of agile but all focused on the corporate i am on a student project team at my and like to see if some agile concepts could work in an environment other than works do have our own project with subversion for version and sharepoint for and action hard enough to arrange a weekly daily standups are our own customers for the most part part of a but we work closely with the just also team action items have the best are there any extensions would it make sense to switch to something else at the expense of a unified interface for everything as the most natural thing to do is wait to the last have our own but easier to do work and no way to predict if anyone else will be there except by making explicit classes have to pass so total commitment to the team is our team could benefit from more than just agile so all suggestions are thanks for all the great going to start asking my teammates how they feel about some of these and see what they buy should i link them to this you can edit your answer or just leave a comment to answer this secondary software engineering practice for student project

been running some metrics on my java project and apparently there are a lot of dependency cycles between i really know how to organize stuff into so i just did what made sense to which is apparently project is a neural network neural networks have which are connected to each other with they need to depend on each there are also different types of so i thought be a good idea to put them all in there own obviously a connection a neuron so it be in the but since they refer to each i now have a circular is just an but i have more situations like how do you handle these kinds of i read that classes in a package higher up in the package hierarchy are not supposed to refer to classes in packages that are this would mean that a neuralnetwork class in package can not refer to the neuron in package do you guys follow this and what if i would move neuralnetwork to or in that it would refer to a sibling package instead of a is that better to organize packages prevent dependency	
been running up against a problem with java swing my wacom graphire tablet for a few years in several java applications and have now encountered it in my use a pen tablet to get around wrist issues while clicking a and it works fine under windows except when using java in java the of the pen work the problem only occurs with dialog boxes or tree the pen tablet also comes with a wireless mouse that works with the same and its does work know whether the problem is in the wacom driver or in the java swing runtime for windows or has anyone encountered this like to file a bug report with wacom but i have no idea what to tell have been able to reproduce this in my own application that has a jeditorpane with an html document that added a hyperlinklistener i get events on every single click with the but i do not get events on every single click with the big difference between a pen and a mouse is that when you click a button on a really easy to cause the without mouse on the pen tablet it is very hard to do and that seems to correlate with the lack of events if i am very careful not to move the pen position when i tap the i think i can get activated suggestions for things to try so i can give wacom some good information on this really frustrating to not be able to use my pen with java especially since the pen works fine with windows i ask this question here but like to find out from a standpoint what might be going on so i can file a good bug swing debugging headaches with wacom pen	
been searching for an answer to this problem as there are a couple sites that have proved though i have a full solution these for possible for the packaging most of the information found indicates that rather than using aswf as the package need to use swf and then convert the compiled swf into your air executable by creating an exec tax to invoke the links above will show you how to do that for the air super pom you i think there are a few different but to use any super you need to have your flex maven project declare the super pom as the with a block similar to just extending the parent pom may not be enough to get your swf building once see the links above for a more detailed treatment of this

been thinking about this lately in regards to database schema at the moment digging into wordpress to see how handled database changes between what found so is loaded from this variable corresponds to a subversion revision and is updated when is through a not when is the wordpress option named is read from the if this number is not equal to is includes a function called scans string of sql queries that will create the most recent database schema from and compares it to the schema in the altering the tables as necessary so that the schema is brought then runs a function called which runs specific functions if is less than target the wordpress will be run if the database version is less than each of these functions run their own data migration and population some of which are called during the initial database setup nicely cuts down on duplicate one way to do

been wondering how to efficiently do this am not sure if this will do the but seems to do what you although you probably want to examine to see how it achieves this as there are some inefficient ways to do thought would be to have the dreaded boolean flag on your models and then creating a custom manager that automatically adds the filter although this work for searches across different yet another solution is to have duplicate models of which seems like but may work for the comments there also discuss different will add that for the most part i consider any of these solutions worth the i usually just suck it up and filter my searches on the boolean it avoids many issues that can come up if you try to get too it is a pain and not very of a reasonable solution would be a mixture of the custom manager while being aware of its limitations if you try searching a related model through

believe answer misses an important when the diagonal is completely outside the polygon from the imagine making the diagonal the two towers of his shaped the two towers creates a diagonal that does not intersect any but is still outside the had to solve this several years so please forgive if my recollection is a bit way i solved this was to perform line intersection tests of the diagonal against every edge in the you then have two possible you either had at least one or you had no if you get any the diagonal is not inside the you get any you need to determine whether the diagonal is completely inside or completely outside the say the diagonal is joining to that i j and you have a polygon with clockwise you can work out if the diagonal is outside the polygon by looking at the edge joining to work out the 2d angle of this edge the as the rotate your diagonal so that the edge is its baseline and compute its 2d image showing the above process in a slightly less wordy done the 2d angle of the diagonal will be positive if the diagonal is outside the or negative if inside the

believe is the self variable passed to is an object of type but the simply overwriting the self variable with the structure stored in instead invoke a set operator for the image property of object in the matlab documentation there is a class with a method called that illustrates the following line in your function savingmyobject may be think it might make most sense make the code a little if you used the name in place of the word within your class code the documentation tends to appear to be any kind of special keyword in matlab it may be in other just another variable as far as i can the prospect of having to set each property individually in your method sound like one way around it is if you have a set method for your object that is designed like the method for handle that set command can accept a structure input where each field name is a property name and each field value is the new value for that then you would have one call a bit especially if you have lots of properties to of then have to the new set method for your but the shortened syntax may be worth the extra work if it comes in handy elsewhere may be able to use the loop suggested in conjunction with a i throw a warning or potentially just do

believe that the best idea is to split the task working on into a smaller logical each such task should be able to be finished in approximately 45 minutes a programmers can switch after each such note that splitting the task is already a kind of work on the target any task can should splitter into a smaller parts as soon as it is a good idea to divide task into a smaller parts on the pair level or manager have to be included in that remember that agile promotes course if subtask takes more time to complete than 45 then you have to switch until it is	
believe that the logic for that is contained in the dll is registered in the project template used when you create a new mvc visual studio could probably also mess around with the project type guids in your to be the default ones for an mvc compare those with the ones in your web and go from in a lot of these circumstances agree with often easier to create the more complex project mvc and then move the origininal into nothing to stop you having multiple projects hosted in the same web application pull the common logic from the web application into a shared class and then reference that from a clean mvc with a slightly different and then merge the two sites within drop the dlls into a shared bin folder strongly name them and put them in the global assembly share the and away you go you just need to take care with the which would be common to ben

benefit of that notation in was to make it easier to see what a type was without having to go search for the these styles appeared before the arrival of intellisense and to we often had to go on a goose chase looking for the declaration in who knows how many header on a large project this could be a significant annoyance which was bad enough when looking at c source but even worse when doing forensics using mixed code and a raw call faced with these using and all the other hungarian rules starts to make some sense even with the maintenance overhead because of how much time it would save just in looking up a type when looking at unfamiliar now of course we have intellisense and to so the main time saving motivation of that naming convention is no longer i think much point in doing that any and i generally try to go with the library guidelines just to be consistent and possibly gain a little bit more tool

best thing to do is to throw an what there and any attempt to duplicate the behavior you get is likely to fail you use an for some use the example in the clause p2 returns 0 if it is technically a form of placement but it should either return a fully formed object or a null pointer that you need to test except that nobody your class can have an object that is there but not properly you can have a data member that serves as a flag as to whether the class is useful or nobody will check that flag in live in mind if you really need to have an allocation that is guaranteed not to you need to allocate the memory ahead of time and use placement and remove all initialization that might throw to another which somebody will fail to anything that allocates memory can particularly on the more confined sorts of systems that usually support the exceptions are the best way to

best valid and normal usage for regex is for email address format a good application of have used regular expressions countless times as in textpad to massage flat create csv create sql insert statements and that sort of written regular expressions be too usually the like tons of calls to replace are far slower might as well do it in one situations call for exactly regular expressions and nothing special characters with innocuous characters is another good can of course imagine that there are some codebases that overuse regular expressions to the detriment of i have never seen that i have actually been eschewed by code reviewers for not using regular expressions

best way to ensure that objects get or in is to ensure that all root references that can be traced through methods and objects to the first method on a call to an object are set to gc and will collect an object if there are any rooted references to no matter whether it implements idisposable or references impose no penalty or possibility of memory as the gc marks which objects it has visited in the object in the case of delegates or eventhandlers it may be common to forget to remove the reference in an event to a target so that the object that contains the target method be collected if the event is has a

best way to get rid of warnings is to address the suspicious code that the warnings complain that change the code such that it is no longer just seek to disable the generation of warnings need to provide more details about the specific warnings concerned and the accompanying but remember to search previous answers here see the warnings are actually text literally in your not messages issued in the compiler the way to get rid of those is to search for the keyword i consider whether the issue that it warns about has been addressed or is still a valid fix the problem if there is and the delete that warning for does a default and if does it need should you use to a property not really asking how to delete a line of are already gone through the whole file and determined that none of the warnings are a quick way of removing all the warning you already have on your then you have a complete development environment get a the option tells it to invert the search thus printing all lines that contain the search those get written into the new then replace the old file with the new

big thing to keep in mind is that forms authentication works based on when the client browser sends a request to the it sends the cookie with each if the server requires a specific cookie makes this a requirement if enforcing authentication on a particular and the cookie this is when you get the unauthorized order to get your jquery the client has to request it from a host which could be an page that is protected via forms this is the first step securing access to the jquery code the next thing you need to do is secure access to the restful you put the endpoint hosting the restful wcf service in in the same directory as part of your application that is being protected by forms authentication via then will reject requests to the endpoint before wcf is told about the in this you can wrap your wcf service in forms authentication without having to do any complicated coding within the when making http requests of your is doing so from within the context of your http requests made from jquery long as the jquery was loaded from the same root as your forms authenticated will contain the authentication

bind is not a method and there is no some object behind the scene holding binding just a word that page parser uses to generate code it translates into eval and control building the on the other will use reflection to access bound i understand correctly what you property binding already assuming you have a property title in your title have to either create your own template or reflect existing one and pass the extracttemplatevaluesmethod method and assign the databinding event to your this is where uses which replace with the property my that is what the databinding event is if you question is more about whether one can have a reference to a then afraid there is no property per you have to methods and and an entry in the you could store a reference to the object and property but then have to use could use the but that would take you back to the same code as the one which is defining extracttemplatevaluesmethod and doing databinding

blocks should only be around pieces of code that are capable of throwing exceptions involving anything involving an external those cases it is best to have only the relevant local variables something that will be these exceptions are expected and so you need to log them in a way that differentiates between expected and code you are not adding extra context to the then you are misusing your logging it is always better to catch and rethrow rather than not catch at all executes the finally but you should also add a relevant note to every logging otherwise you will actually be damaging your ability to debug the because you have no idea where the exception was thrown files are no harm in having a lot of information in them whenever you throw an the more error logging you the easier it will be to debug a production

book for game has a very good explanation of i was actually going to write an implementation if i do throw the code up code is it is too big to put so you can grab it signed but the server do anything followed the in the book for the most but i made everything much more object oriented than anything i have seen thus far for have a maze that consists of each tile has a location and an obstacle if there is no can use a pathfinder to find th shortest path between a given start and end you get a path back which includes the tiles you need to go through to get from the start to the can change the heuristic calculation by providing a different heuristiccalculator current one just checks to see if there is an obstacle or not and figures out the shortest number of tiles to go you could add weights to different obstacles for instance if you like the code is license under the so if you make changes and distribute the app you have to make the changes feel free to send bug to the email address in the license comment in each get around to commenting it after but i think it is pretty straight

but still believe there is something to add to the superb advice given so to answer your question we need to go a level hence the long been made a tech lead responsible for team and although many aspects of your everyday job might seem to resemble your dev days the way you need to go about them has in software development environment there is usually not that much of a tangible change when you appointed a tech lead probably still seating at the same wearing the same as opposed to becoming a foreman on construction site or a the flattering change though is that you now get invited into all these meeting and start getting all these and phone calls from people outside the dev lack of tangible change might trick your mind into thinking that you just need to keep treating your job mostly the this is not the case and you need to be conscious about your actions and in the new it might seem now a bit externally and you might be inclined to share some of that coming your way play a bit of democracy and generally be this is not that much about fairness or the new job is the dev team by personal example and creating imagery depicting the an abstraction layer between the team and other organisational much like in programming you often create an abstraction layer to encapsulate and hide the same happens in the the interface that has to encapsulate the dev and any good encapsulation from an outsider point of inner complexity that is not relevant to the task at hand as concrete implementation of an from the outside things that could affect the outside user explicit that can be any limitations and constraints gives meaningful principles are equally applicable to the outward not an easy task to follow these actually it involves a lot of concrete such as deciding what details are internal and what facts need to be communicated and how the feedback needs to be best structured and be presented in a consistent manner and who should be notified externally of and who needs to followed up and this is a lot of even if some of it seems to be just trivial to inward one way is to but it clogs the internal network and everyone has to spend their time on deciding whether the communication bears any relevance to it is like having a very generic algorithm that regardless of input always does the exact same amount of sure but why would you want to do a more efficient way is obviously to adjust processing depending on the input and here it has to be job to make a decision how the team should go about to or convert the what sequence of actions needs to be just acknowledge and store for future follow put an issue off for a later review and then make sure it is reviewed and fed back into the is not a small job either and someone has to do obviously now your job to manage the outward and inward and you have to spend some of your processing power to do it so no one else has to and devs can concentrate on their are some other good reasons for not or everyone regardless of your job means cc note for future bcc or mass you should be careful when you use one or another a group of a single person is a straight forward when a group of people only these who you need to take action a simple this is default in any other case explicitly tell them what is expected no action needed only these who you want to take note of the information for the future if you expect a number of to go back and forth before an agreement is reached or issue is resolved best to send a summary confirmation later to other parties that need to be besides saving time and avoiding misinterpretation due to someone taking note of a communication that will help make exchange more flow more and reduce formalism and often treated formally and this always a good thing sometimes exactly what you bcc is almost never the knowledge of someone eavesdropping on your conversations if come to light will easily ruin your it is simply a question of and should your team worry then that you might be their conversations to someone mass mailing through bcc in most cases is also it creates an impression that is specifically addressed to the and require little but multiply noise and dilutes it is worth to give some thought to what exactly you need a person to do and what they should know to act on your communication before composing conversations are best taken completely or better still because it gives you more room for broadcasting or formalising in writting is just like putting yourself into a you can always confirm in writing to the second part of a tech lead responsibility the team through personal example and imagery depicting the to accomplish that you need to pass on to the team every single piece of information that happen to end in your you have to create a story and any good story is an abstraction of real events that consists of only relevant and interesting detail for a particular creating this brief story on the basis of your everyday experience and judging what is relevant and interesting and then presenting it regularly to the team is also quite a forget that by directing the team and serving as abstraction layer you help developers and outside world to interact more accomplish more and tackle greater the job has a

can loop through keys like key in logs and you have a more complex object type just a plain as in the original want to only loop through keys that belong to the object as opposed to keys on the key in if you keys are not guaranteed to be in any particular note how this differs from the each value in example loops through so it would log and the syntax is mostly only supported in but not in other your target browsers support or your site includes you can also use data loop with logs

can pass an array by but you have to first wrap it in a struct or or simply use a type like think the decision was for the sake of one want to do this most of the the same reasoning as why there are no unsigned there is no associated cpu so you have to make not efficient very hard to do in a language like and boost both have wrapped native arrays into structs providing and which i would always prefer because it allows passing and returning of arrays within array is a pointer to the memory that holds that array and the note it is not the exact same as a pointer to the first element of the people think that you have to pass an array as a pointer and specify the size as a separate but this is not you can pass a reference to the actual array itself while maintaining you need the size because you have reduced your array to an pointing to the first int function can take in an array of size as test2 but by to access elements you need to people may say that the size of an array is not this is not what about allocations on the allocations on the heap do not return an they return a pointer to the first element of an so new is not type if you do indeed have an array then you will know the size of what it

can probably read the body of the document tree and perform simple string tests on it without having to go far beyond that it depends a bit on the html you are working though how much control do you have over the if you are working within a site you you can probably focus your search on the parts of the page likely to be different page from if you are working with other pages got a tougher job on your hands simply because you necessarily know what content you need to test if you are going to search the same page multiple times and your data set is large it may be worth creating some kind of index in whereas if you are only going to search for a few words or use smaller documents its probably not worth the time and complexity to build the best thing to do is to get some sample documents that you feel will be representative and just do a whole lot of prototyping based around the approaches people have offered

can tell you what worked for me on a commercial board game style your representation of the board and core game logic into own with well defined interfaces to the rest of the we had functions like bool and bool along with interfaces back to the gui such as board and rules only knew the state of the and what was valid to it know anything about or anything each we would handle input from the user at the gui send commands to the state and then be the game state code would get resolve if they were valid or update the game state and then send messages back to the gui to visually represent the new state of teh these updates were queued by the visual representation so we could batch a bunch of animations to happen in good thing about this is that the board know or care about human ai your ai can be a separate submodule that acts on it can send the same commands as the human and the game logic and visual results will be the need to either have a local bit of info about the game board or expose some functionality from the game logic that lets the ai the but you could register each ai as an observer pattern on the game so they get notified when the board updates as in case they need to do any complex realtime each section of your game separate and isolated will help with unit and provide a more robust well defined interfaces are your	
can think of 2 basic scenarios for using creating your business object from data incomplete and will fail for parsing a csv file or an excel file from where your business object is if you use data directly from these objects to create your business it is quite possible to fail several validation rules within the because data from such files are prone to they also tend to have a different structure that you have in your final business having a placeholder for that incomplete data will be transporting your business object through a medium that is bandwidth if you are using a web you will need to use dtos to simplify your object before otherwise the clr will have a hard time trying to serialize all your	
can think of a few different ways to do some of which use jquery depending on what you are trying to custom css and have your view choose which css file to use based on the selection from the this would be view code that constructs a css link based on the value of the database apply classes to your controls from the theme theme would have the same just different settings for each want the user to be able to actually change a particular look and not merely choose a in this case there are a couple of different options one have a helper that generates custom css for the user based on the database values again using common classes so that you can style the controls with call this helper from your view and inject the correct css into the page either directly or as a link to an action that generates the css in response to a and i like this set the style property on the control itself using the view layout and get the value of the background color property from new id want to have the color change dynamically based on a user action and have the new come from the in this case you can inject the color into the script tag where your jquery lives see any need to use a hidden

certainly not the only but i do hope part of a declining trend problem with hungarian notation is that trying to implement a type system via naming this is extremely problematic because a type system with only human every human on the project has to agree to the same set of do rigorous code reviews and ensure that all new types are assigned the appropriate and correct in impossible to guarantee consistency with a large enough code at the point there is no consistency why are you doing tools support hungarian that might seem like a stupid comment on the surface but consider refactoring for each refactoring in a hungarian naming convention system must be accompanied with a mass rename to ensure that prefixes are mass renames are susceptible to all sorts of subtle of using names to implement a type just rely on the type it has automatic verification and tool newer make it much easier to discover a type hover etc and really remove the original desire for hungarian

common problem in any language is to assert that parameters sent in to a method meet your and if they to send informative error this kind of code gets repeated over and and we often try to create helpers for in it seems those helpers are forced to deal with some duplication forced upon us by the language and to show what i let me present some some raw code with no followed by one possible point out the duplication in the helper and phrase my question the code without any void string int throw new value for firstname cannot be throw new value for lastname cannot be same kind of code for making sure it is a reasonable range for you get the the code with a reasonable attempt at a void string int x main question is notice how the code has to pass the value of the parameter the name of the parameter this is so the error message can blah blah the value for the have you found any way to get around this using reflection or anything or a way to make it less more have you found any other ways to streamline this task of validating parameters while reducing code read people talking about making use of the parameters but never quite found a way around the anyone have luck with is the most appealing syntax found for asserting parameter correctness in	
common problem with thread startup is that the arguments passed exist on only the stack in the calling thread startup is often such that the calling function returns and it is only some time later the thread actually starts by which time the arguments are no longer in solution to this is to create an event and then start the passing the event as one of the the starting function then waits on the which is signalled by the thread when it has completed

compilers courses usually focus on how the code is analyzed and translated into machine very but not more important to understand what is this machine code that is generated by the compiler so that you understand how a computer works and what is the cost of each language rather say that you should know an assembly language mean a limited subset of assembly language for one to understand how a computer works and the latter is definitely required for a competent programmer so that he understands what segmenation fault when to optimize and when not and other similar

controlled windows media player through the windows media library and using a singleton	
controls are a form of custom that gives you a visual they are ideal for use when you want a reusable control within the same web is possible to create and package user controls as seperate assemblies but that is beyond the scope of this question and i know has been asked on custom control is typically used to refer to a web or a composite control which is specialized form of a web these controls have no designer and are usually implemented in seperate projects from your web allowing them to be reused accross many your second ascx and aspx are two different ascx is the extension for a user where as aspx is an you cannot use an ascx by itself it must be placed onto an aspx or master way i like to use user controls is i have for example a very complex page which have 7 5 of those have of those grids three of them are well what i can do is create a seperate user control for the content of the this now reduces the code i need down significantly three grids are identicle except for the more it allows multiple to work on various parts of the and it helps me keep everything straight since i am reducing the complexity of the you do not use user controls instead of you use them in conjuction with a do not use ascx over you use ascx to for example on my site every page has the same but i want every page to derive from a single master i can create my footer as an acsx control and put it in each of my master i have a form that lets a user enter three different date we have other so i put the logic to enable a calender and a text box that when clicked on opens up the in a user i can then reuse that user control in all my aspx	
controls can be created on void eventarguments the checkboxes dynamically checkbox for i i c new a div with attribute or use an container try clicking the button the state will be always be	
controls in form1 will be private class other good stuff private you access this directly from another could make it public as suggests that would be a really bad better plan would be to use properties as would still need to pass a reference to the form to the class that you wish to have consume the properties though pointed out by are trying to write a class in your application that directly asks the ui for this usually considered a very good the class should be entirely concerned with own you should design properties or events for the specific bits of data that the class needs access to and not necessarily pass it the entire maybe just the values that it needs to work with or

correct interpretation of is that you tell something to the you tell the compiler despite not being present right the variable declared will somehow be found by the linker in another object the linker will then be the lucky guy to find everything and put it whether you had some extern declarations or avoid exposure of names outside of a specific object you would have to use	
correct target has always been to download it from sun and just install it that then you know exactly what directory everything goes if prefer to stick with the odd way that debian installs my best guess would be the parent directory just above where the java and javac binaries are when you specify it in your path in your case it would be and would be that sound interested to hear the answer to this	
correct to put code you want to run into you can use shorter does exactly the

could add a unique constraint to the table definition and include all columns the primary i unique constraints create so i have no idea what sort of performance impact this might but guess the fewer the will add such a constraint to an existing table constraint unique that there are certain restrictions on column types so this may or may not work for your see books online for

could create a view that joins usersetting and setting that represents all settings for each then use the view in your dbml file in addition to instead the usersettings association of works unless you want to be able to add new in which case you may want the usersettings association to be around have a sql server but the view would probably look something like as as as case when is not null then as else as end as cross join left join usersetting on and	
could create an interface with a common method for each class to implement that emitted the that you needed in a polymorphic not that crazy about this suggestion because it leaks the user interface into the model classes in a bad perhaps another way around it would be a visitor pattern that could emit the ui for have to add code when a new type would be reluctant to create a custom tag have to be careful to ensure that style leak into making css skinning

current language design philosophy is that nullability should be something a programmer is forced to ask not given by default on reference types i agree with tony hoare google for his recent qcon this specific with the unnullable it even pass static conservative analysis cannot guarantee that b2 so the program is not semantically ethos is simple references are an indirection handle to some which we can traverse to obtain access to that nullable references are an indirection handle to a a notification that the resource is not and one is never sure up front which semantics are being this gives either a multitude of checks up front it or the inevitable npe most programming resources these not massively resource constrained or bound to some finite underlying model null references one just bung a null in which i have too much sympathy know what to put in here typically also a legacy of older where you had to declare your resource names before you knew what your resources went a better error reporting mechanisms are thus essential in a know have something give me a this has more and we can think of ways to combat solving each of the cases that null current caters for with a better linguistic choice is no small and may add more confusion that it we can always go to immutable so null in only useful states and much real imperative technqiues are here to stay and frankly glad this makes the search for better solutions in this space

database architecture consists of two sql server 2005 servers each with an instance of the same database one for all and one for all we use transactional replication to keep the read database two servers are very indeed write server has 32gb of and are connected via a fibre deciding upon this architecture we were led to believe that the latency for data to be replicated to the read server would be in the order of a few milliseconds on in practice we are seeing latency of around seconds in even the simplest of which is by a simplest i mean updating a single value in a single row in a single table on the write db and seeing how long it takes to observe the new value in the read factors should we be looking at to achieve latency below 1 is this even is there a different mode of replication we should what is the best practice for the locations of the data and log to all for the advice and insight i believe that the latency periods we are experiencing we were by our db hosting company as to what latency times to using the technique described near the bottom of msdn the heading and failed to deal properly with this consequence of creating such specialized databases is a write is now going to take time to be distributed to the reader but if you can deal with the the scaling potential is now looking at implementing a change to our caching mechanism that enforces reads from the write database when an item of data is considered to be it possible to get latency with transactional

default setting for is so by expanding and collapsing of nodes should be happening client note the remarks for that property though the enableclientscript property to specify whether the treeview control renders script on compatible browsers to handle expanding and collapsing when this property is set to compatible browsers execute the code to expand and collapse nodes on the tree node data must be known in advance for the script to using client script prevents a post back to the server each time a node is expanded or to do have the node data avaiable to the tree view data source without a set enableclientscript to not using a control adaptor overriding this somehow confusing the server into thinking that a page is running on i so might be different to your server it treats my version of ie with an overweight useragent string as because the check cuts off after 128 and you have all the data then you should ensure that you are setting and to no reason why you do what attempting to do with a tree view control it should do most of this for you unless you supplying the whole tree up in which case need to supply the methods that will populate the nodes through populatenodesfromclient and assuming the browser is recognised correctly previous links have examples of both with and without jquery tree view plugins will probably be more flexible not used them so i know i have used the treeview control but was getting the features because i only had a small and was supplying all the data up but will require a bit more work to set need to pull in the jquery if not already using a web service that it can call to get the initial data along with subsequent worry about what happens to browsers with limited or no javascript may or may not be the kicker for you in everything we we try to use javascript to enhance not provide the functionality as the jquery library is all client if the browser support your jquery treeview control and possibly be losing a key navigational whereas a server control like the treeview control will notice that javascript supported and resolve this for you by falling back to a server based version of the should also remember that jquery a microsoft thing they do now and has been around for quite some and as a client side it works independantly of the server technology ms give us a number of controls within the framework that we use if we want and doing so can make our lives easier in the short term but we have to a prime example is the recently released mvc which is a different way of building web applications on iis using the stack but generally without the server

delete operator deletes only a never an object if it did delete the object other remaining references would be like a accessing one of them would cause a to make them all turn null would mean having extra work when deleting or extra memory for each javascript is garbage you need to delete objects themselves they will be removed when there is no way to refer to them can be useful to delete references to an object if you are finished with because this gives the garbage collector more information about what is able to be if references remain to a large this can cause it to be unreclaimed even if the rest of your program actually use that

deserializing a fair amount of data through for each when i output how long the deserialization it varies it is not unusably slow at the but it would be nice to make it the data represents the same maps and vectors but merely with different at the memory spiking as each deserialization takes i have to believe a better way of doing this than continually allocating and deallocating all this a few of the read times as an 390 422 422 422 438 2156 1797 1656 1328 1219 1078 1078 there a way of writing a custom deserialization function for the same data that uses so i can specify to allocate the memory at the and then just change their values for each i realised a minor issue with the optimization flags i was using was causing the serialization data to be written which resulted in the inconsistency of deserialization after fixing it is now consistently at 750 780 milliseconds each my original question still as currently i am serializing and deserializing an entire stl when i really want to only serialize the contents the size and indexing of the container will remain exactly the not sure of the best way to go about doing this deserialization

designing a very simple terms of but difficult terms of system where users can message each think of it as a very simple chatting a user can insert a message through a php the message is short and has a recipient another php the user can view all the messages that were sent to him all at once and then deletes them on the all the functionality needed for this how should i go about designing this a point of far i have the table like message recipient for sql i find that the time it takes is constant regardless of number of rows in the so my will have a guaranteed return time which is for pulling down my will take longer as the number of rows i find the sql select will take longer as the rows grow and this is true even after i have an index for the recipient if it was simply the case that users will have to wait a longer time before their messages are pulled on the php then it would have been but what i am worried is that when each service time takes really the php server will start to refuse connections to some or worse the server might just the question how to design this such that it any some estiamte on of users starts with and goes user on average have around 10 messages stored before the other end might pull it user sends around messages a from reading the answers so just want to clarify that by pulling down less messages from does not even just pull one message will take a long time when the table is this is because the table has all the messages so you have to do a select like message from db where recipient if you change it to this it help top 1 message from db where recipient far from the answers it seems like the longer the table the slower the select will be or slightly no way around if that is the how should i handle this from the php i want the php page to fail on the http because the user will be confused and end up refreshing like mad which makes it even some suggestion for a database schema

developing a dynamic html window absolute positioned using jquery that automatically centers itself on the it can also accommodate content that fits or exceeds the dimensions of the window idea is that our customer clicks a link next to our product listing and then this window comes up and displays its sales each sales letter also contains a video that further describes the window will remain at the center of the screen until it is dismissed by either clicking the close button in the window or clicking outside of it remains in the center by adjusting its absolute positioning based upon where the user scrolls and if they resize the problem is in the video in all other browsers except firefox all the video is rendered perfectly within the window as the user scrolls around the document or resizes the in when the user and the window adjusts its absolute positioning the video looks like it smudges from where it was originally to where it is now or the video screen goes thought maybe what needed to be done is force firefox to redraw the video i tried a few different ways to accomplish simply making the element disappear and reappear quickly seem to do the if i quickly adjusted its margins or position back and it seemed to i was going to go with this but as i began to test it across other this motion seemed to slow down the specifically i noticed it in chrome tested it on the other browsers thought about limiting this fix to but the browser data field in jquery was deprecated in i could always make the javascript myself to identify the but i was wondering if there was a better way to go about forcing the browser to redraw the video or maybe on the wrong track and it need to be using firefox chrome internet explorer 7 and safari input would be appreciated the code for the wigglevids i changed the code so that way embeded elements are wiggled only when the popup position has instead of binding it to the window scroll this has sped up execution a but its still not there quite its still a noticeable following i changed the code so that the embeded videos in the popup window are stored in an this when this function gets executed the browser have to search the dom again and again for the embeded myvids is globally declared and cleared when the popup if 0 if 0 var ctr ctr var myobj var temp var suffix var currentmargin suffix suffix 2 temp var newmargin currentmargin newmargin currentmargin 1 do i force firefox to redraw a video

developing sever many times important to know how stuff works when connections suddenly or have a very low however since it would cost a fortune to develop a test network that could emulate all the above we need to emulate them through way to do this would be to alter the client and server but not very cost effective and the other method would be through intercepting and altering behavior at the os which seems more and the type of tools looking for right case in particular is with solaris but generic tools are more than also feel free to post tools as it will probably help others that come along but using are some unix tools to emulate bad	
development is a strange beast unto os x uses a port of gcc with some modifications to make it in possible to the the sources to the apple gcc and toolchain as well as the apple kernel and library headers and build a cross compiler on your windows want to go down this path is beyond you can have a cheap mac mini from the time you invest getting a cross compiler working right with a windows host for unix will probably cost more than the really keen to make your app cross platform look into wxwidgets or all provide support with minimal changes to the base at least that way all you need to do is find a mac to compile your app and not too hard to do if you have some technically minded friends who mind giving you ssh access to their	
development team is using so a new team member gets a vm with visual studio and sql server 2008 express already these commercial tools where we have the chance to are not in our version control but we do have versioned documentation of what tools are installed on the vm the open source tool being checked into the repository works as you checking a new version and updating the references allows instant upgraded for the but it works well in this case because no tool installation our case we have our middle ground tools like ccnet are checked into the we are mainly working with one large so everything goes into under a previous we had a common tools area in the because of the different projects not all wanting to switch to a new version of a tool at the same each version of the tool needed to be checked into its own making this area of the repository little different than a file the repository controlled storage can still be version control tools allow you to specify to bring down all of the needed project

did what arno setagaya suggested in his made some sample tests and compared the compression tests were done using 5 each of them 4096 bytes in each byte inside of these 5 files was generated in real the data would not likely be all but would tend to have quiet a bit of repeating thus in real life application the compression would tend to be a bit better then the following each of the 5 files was compressed by itself not together with the other 4 which would result in better in the following results i just use the sum of the size of the 5 files together for included rar just for comparison even though it is not open best to 20775 20480 100 of original 20825 20480 100 of original 20827 20480 100 of original 21020 20480 100 of original 22899 20480 100 of original to my surprise all of the tested algorithms produced a larger size then the i guess they are only good for compressing larger or files that have a lot of repeating bytes random data like the thus i will not be using any type of compression on my tcp maybe this information will be useful to others who consider compressing small pieces of forgot to mention that i used default options for each of the

do this a so axiously awaiting other replies only tricks i know are really here are my best friends in emacs when refactoring allows you to do a global search and be doing this a ton when you move methods and data to other classes or gives you a display with two buffers you can then proceed to load different files in and move your cursor from one to the other with this is pretty basic but i mention it because of how powerful it makes the next any amount of stuff emacs commands is how you define a macro in any time you find yourself needing to do the same thing over and over to a bunch of code it is too complex for this is a if you mess you can hit to stop the macro and then undo until you are back to where you the keys to invoke the macro are if you want to do it a bunch of you can hit and type in a number 100 will try to invoke your macro 100 on windows you can get by hitting the esc or holding down

do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of amazon web services s3 compared with google application the cost per gigabyte for the two at the time i roughly i have not seen any widespread complaints about the quality of so i think the decision of which one to use may depend on the api all api breaks your content into what they call such as your css etc and http requests for static stuff will be served to whoever requests it until your bandwidth limit is requests will be fulfilled until your bandwidth or cpu limit is with respect to your you can provide any logic you are able to express in so you can be choosy about who you api treats all your content as blobs in a and provides an access protocol that lets you distinguish between a variety of fulfillable requests ranging from to if you want to something not in the i know what you do beyond being thoughtful about distributing your differences do you see between the are there other cloud storage services you had a press release but looking for a minimum of ten terabytes on the beta and none of my clients are there and will probably do something in the near advantages of storage using amazon web services s3 vs google application

doing some automated since i have a codebase which is not very standard in its and i was wondering what the best way was to read a php file and grab the contents of a comment the only way i can think to do it is to open the file and read it but thought that maybe there was some magic that would parse the document for similar to the reflection basic layout of each file is like here is this with information in type tags and something some information about etc etc rest of the code goes important to note that these files have any functions or classes defined in the comments relate to the script as a to read comment blocks in

doing something similar i have built a custom grid in flex that contains an additional button on it that allows the user to open the data up in done this by writing a function in php on the server which my flex speaks this creates the csv file on the server and the function passes the link back to the which in turn offers the user the chance to open the data up in using the zend technologies to accomplish this i recommend you take a extremely i used to use flex data services and java do do this but just recently switched to php because development time is cut down drastically as a this	
doing sounds pretty good to capacity is cheap and minimising network usage is you could have the server for each what last dataset and send only the differences a list of deletions and on each if you sort your data rows these differences can be calculated fairly efficiently using a differencing algorithm such as that used by approach is sensitive to network outages if one response is not received by the errors will however this can be remedied by having the client sent the md5 hash with each if it is different than what the server an entire list will be sent instead of a list of

done a fair amount of work on mvc on the and learning about it in my oop seeing some and i tell whether because the version of the mvc pattern is different than the traditional or whether i misunderstood my the model flat is a generic the view is what the user interacts and the controller mediates between the users actions and the the controller is the most and it manages the tells the model what it and tells the views what to we have the views matching what i just the model contains a list of the views so that it can update them when the data and the controller simply maps the actions to calls to the model and to specific objects may ask the model to update the what ends up happening is that most of the business logic is in the and tied very heavily to the simulation or application that is being while the controller is reduced to a mapping tool between commands and are your thoughts on the version of mvc different than traditional

done this in the and really only doable if you implement the css spec to the letter and just implement the stuff that you what i ended up doing was implementing a css the selector statements and the cascading the properties and the layout model were completely different because that simply needed at that say that that also been where the bulk of the work of writing a full css engine done instead was create something that mimics the way html tables work because they are conceptually easy to work with and because the application itself was impartial to the whole find a lot of helpful resources on except for the css spec because it contains the flex and bison syntax rules in that you might want to look at how webkit and mozilla have implemented their layout engines as a

dragon has a small section about what you use regular expressions detect repetition of a meaning you match constructs like where w is the same succesion of can only detect a fixed number of repetition or an unspecified number of which is to say you use an already parsed token to determine the number of something s1 s2 expressions be used to describe balanced or nested the set of strings of all balanced 1 and a simple you a substring so you can match it if you than you would be using a just think of how you would be using regular expressions for those and you will intuitively come to the conclusion you the same as the problem in for parsing string you just say a string literal is between the first and the second but what happens when an escaped for the relation to i think hunch is because the problem is limited introspection the book has references to the if you want i can look them up for

easy method of doing this your service runs in the same process as the is to use a shared preferences the activity can write to the preferences file whenever a radio button is and the service can either register a listener on the preferences or check the state whenever writing to the more complicated way which avoids preferences would be for the service to be started with that it remains running even if the activity is not and then for the activity to call the service if it is not to return an ibinder stub it can communicate for this i recommend you look at the api

embedded it is often necessary to access fixed memory locations for peripheral the standard way i have found to do this is something like the access register which is located at address write to x read from understand how that but what i understand is how the space for is allocated what keeps the linker from putting another variable at can the space be reserved at the c or does there have to be a linker option that specifies that nothing should be located at using the gnu tools so am mostly interested in the specifics of that toolset at the additional information about my architecture to clarify the processor interfaces to an fpga via a set of registers mapped into the regular data space variables of the so i need to point to those registers and block off the associated address in the i have used a compiler that had an extension for locating variables from c i would group the registers into a then place the struct at the appropriate byte byte regs creating a struct reserves the space in the using the gnu i obviously have the using the pointer reg1 reg2 regs is a simple application with no os and no advanced memory address variable in

enum is can avoid casting from your type and constrain the values that can be explicitly cast to your type by making a sealed and providing conversion an implicit operator for converting from your type to a generic int so you have to an explicit operator for converting from an int to your which throws an error if the integer fails to meet the such as 0 x using this create a generic immutable base class such as which has a constructor that accepts a t value and delegate for the bool the constructor should run the value through the constraint and throw an exception if it fails to meet the the base class should also take care of the implicit conversion operation to and should handle equality by overloading and defining and operators for the type and implementing and i also recommend defining an copy constructor for the base and all derived cloning can then be implemented cleanly in the base class by retrieving the copy constructor via but this is entirely you can figure out the implementation unless already posted it on stackoverflow can provide named static readonly values in your derived so that you can access them just like an sealed class public static readonly constraint 0 x public static readonly returnvalue success new public static readonly returnvalue failreason1 new public static readonly returnvalue failreason2 new private int value constraint private returnvalue original base be used to support iclonable implementation in base public static explicit operator int value to return an existing instance is more efficient than creating a new one and the constraint when there is a limited number of allowed if the constraint was more such as an even then you would instead return a new instance and make your constructors case return case return case return throw new fails to meet the constraint defined for could use this technique for any for a class called evennumber may have a constraint that returns true if the given number is in that just make your constructors and simplify your static conversion operator to just return a new instead of switching to return one of the limited existing could be used like x y exception fails to meet the constraint defined for a enum would stupidly allow such a creating an invalid breaking the z no cast

equality comparison of a type overload these would correspond to if such an interface do this for each t you want to compare bool operator t bool operator t comparison code should be done in one the interface method comparing to another type implement as and put the field comparison code for that type in overloaded methods and operators should forward the equality comparison task to the main instance such that an clean dependency hierarchy is maintained and stricter guarantees are introduced at each level to eliminate redundancy and unessential if is this for each you may return to return is null or cannot be compared to this therefore it is not if to object for reference equality or use return performance only if object instance is frequently compared to otherwise just an extra useless return type fields to determine static bool operator t t y if to object for reference equality or use return y to equals on instance if return was y is not return static bool operator t t y if return y to equals on instance if return was y is not return preceding implementation centralizes the field comparison to the end of the implementation for the and operators have a parallel but opposite i prefer this over having one reference the such that there is an extra method call for the dependent if the operator is simply going to call the rather than offer an equally performing then you may as well just use and avoid the extra method is left out from the equals operator and the because it can introduce unnecessary overhead in some inconsistent performance depending on how often an instance is compared to itself vs other alternative i but should is to reverse this centralizing the equality code in the equality operator instead and have the equals methods depend on one could then use the shortcut of to check for reference equality and null equality simultaneously as philip mentioned in an earlier but that idea is it seems like killing two birds with one but your actually creating more work after determining the objects are neither both null nor the same you will in still have to on to check whether each instance is in my you check for any single instance being null exactly by the time the equals instance method is already ruled out that the first object being compared is so all left to do is check whether the other is so after at most two we jump directly into the field no matter which method we use as i if you really are comparing and object to itself the majority of the then you could add that check in the equals method just before diving into the field the point in adding it last is that you can still maintain the hierarchy without introducing a check at every

everyone else is correct about the performance of virtual methods and i think the real problem is whether the team knows about the definition of the virtual keyword in this what is the void b public void a new b new a2 new return surprising nothing is if the virtual keyword is added to the front of foo in both a and b we get this for the much what everyone you mentioned that there are bugs because someone forgot to add a virtual so consider this code the virtual keyword is added to but not b what is the output virtual void b public void a new b new a2 new return the same as if the virtual keyword is added to the reason is that the signature for matches exactly as and because foo is so is consider the case where foo is virtual and is what is the output in this the output virtual keyword works downwards in the not it never makes the base class methods the first time a virtual method is encountered in the hierarchy is when the polymorphism there a way for later classes to make previous classes have virtual forget that virtual methods mean that this class is giving future classes the ability to some of its if you have a rule to remove the virtual it may not have the intended virtual keyword in is a powerful you should make sure each member of the team really knows this concept so that it can be used as

first as i cannot see your would be to use a profiling tool to determine the actual memory may well be the core in which case a pool allocation assuming you have objects as david would likely you are serializing a large array of objects to the regular ascii format the conversion from ascii to binary may well consume some the equivalent of is likely but when you say i am assuming some sort of picture or network and it is probably so the overhead of may well be significant once done millions of understand the distinction you are making between the contents and the in there is not much overhead in collections in terms of there may be some in with respect to hashing and tree but the profiler should show that as the part you believe is slow may well have limited bearing on the overall profile and see for

first interesting part would be to why do you an object changes its class at are various want it to respond differently to some methods for a given state of the might want it to have new functionality that the original class typed languages such as java and allow this to because the type of the object should be know at compile programming languages such as python and ruby may allow this i know for but i know they can add methods at runtime the first the answer given by charlie flowers is using the state patterns would allow a class behave differently but the object will have the same the second you would need to change the object type anyway and assign it to a new reference with the extra so you will need to create another distinct object and end up with two different

for are pointers in disguise with some added syntactic pointers have any number of performance and efficiency aliasing is one notable the compiler guarantee that the memory underneath the pointer or reference is the same as the last time it read because any old pointer can go through and modify the compiler is forced to the value from memory on every use rather than caching it in most processors registers are memory accesses are so we never want to access memory if we can avoid primitive types often go into the compiler has complete control over what data resides in each register and can guarantee that nothing will overwrite the so variables of primitive types can potentially stay in registers for a long time until the compiler needs to write any changes back out to when dealing with primitive often less efficient to use a it disallows the compiler from caching the value in a inserts hidden and can open you up to performance issues arising from the efficiency important to you in this but you said you think of a good reason not to use the reference other than saving i submit there is a very good practice with this in in my would be to use references primarily for aggregate the compiler pass these around in a single register so the relative cost of using the reference is going to be heavily if the type in question is a primitive i would always prefer to work with a copy of the value rather than a

for real because all of java is still the application can use our existing common these libs have been built in java over the past 10 and important for access to other systems within the the most crucial thing about enterprise applications is getting too rigid is what makes most enterprise apps decay and eventually there are two problems that lead to this and scala helps avoid both of one problem is just the sheer volume of java works better than c or but it still requires many more lines of code to implement an application than scala combating the code size problem requires higher degrees of customizable why we deploy java ee apps that have twenty to fifty jar files in their that structure itself is necessary to get the app but it can create its own problem in terms of conceptual immune from an overload of conceptual but the common programming style in scala tends toward more concrete programs rather than libraries for frameworks for building if you actually do need libraries for frameworks for building where being able to call back into java comes in

get to work with a number of mostly with developers and sometimes directly with the one thing that comes up often is that when architects prescribe an application they want it to be followed consistently every time with little to no room for good example of this is the presentation model when i think of this i think of it as have an object model to represent the state and behaviors of the current and a view object that surfaces it to the in my the things representing the state is more conceptual than a prescriptive a view might use many objects to represent this or it might use or perhaps it is so simple that it needs or perhaps it shares the ethos of the pattern is that we seperate the state management from the visualization often what i come across is the patterns being intepreted much more a typical project might look like the model object is or the viewmodel is just forwarding property to the model sometimes the view is so that the extra objects just make it more complicated than it needs to do you prefer developers follow the same process every time like a or do you prefer to leave the details up to the much autonomy do you give developers in applying

goes like are but users will give you processing time in their browsers for code is relatively expensive compared to code on any site big enough to need to run more than one there are some things like data validation and retrieval that you leave to the like to do them on the because it means faster response times for the users and less server infrastructure for but security and accessibility concerns mean that code is typically happens is that you do you write your server side logic because you have but you also write the same logic in javascript in the hopes of providing faster responses to the user and saving your servers a little extra work in some since all programmers here we should immediately spot the new not only the extra work involved in developing two sets of the same but also the work involved in maintaining the bugs that inevitably result because the platforms match up and the bugs introduced as the implementations drift apart a little over the idea is that you can write code so that the same code runs on both the server and the this would appear to solve most of the you get the full set of both server and client logic done all at no no double also nice when your developers only need to know one language for both server and client in the real world it work out so the problem is server view of a page is just too different from the client view of a the server needs to be able to do things like talk directly to a database that just be done from the the browser needs to do things like manipulate a dom that match up with control the javascript engine of the meaning there will still be important language differences between your server code and your client database is normally a bigger bottleneck than the web so savings are just about everyone knows a little not that many developers really know and understand javascript completely insurmountable technical you constrain the language to a of javascript well supported across most provide an ide that knows this subset and the make some rules about page structure to minimize dom and provide some javascript for inclusion on the client to make the platform a little nicer to the result is something like aptana which can be pretty in the there are just too many pitfalls and little compatibility issues to as expensive as additional servers are still cheap compared to additional and most programmers know how to be much more productive using something really like to see is partial when a page is requested or a form submitted the server platform does validation in perhaps as a plugin to the web server completely independent from the rest of but the is built using the platform of your

going to need the email address in the then have to store them in plain could encrypt of this is effectively security through obscurity in this if your perimeter is your data within it can be plain encrypting here adds complexity to you working with the but really stop an attacker from getting your raw you if he gets through your perimeter likely to easily get your decryption key to decrypt the email encryption may slow down the determined attacker but will not add any real security to your best scenario is to hash the email address and store this allows you to check the email address against an input value and verify that the email address input is the same as what you have of the major downside for this is that you know what the email address is without that additional so if wanting to regularly email your be out of suspect storing the email address because useful and you want to do something with it send an email in which encrypting just adds overhead to working with that whilst gaining very little in this i would focus on securing access the database itself your and ensure they are as strong as can whilst leaving the data in the database in plain

got an object that handles in memory caching for my data access layer and i need to persist it between from what read the preferred method is to use with code like shared property as if not new end return end value as if not end end end is this trying to serialize the object and if so how do i get it to leave the object intact and just reference it in memory instead of serializing i need to keep the object intact as it handles db connections and caching under the i run this i get an error that causes the page to there are two items in the event application version time stamp faulting module version time stamp exception code fault offset process id application start time state server has closed an expired the ip address of the client is the expired read operation began at then rehashed the code to put the items into a dictionary object against the session id and i get those smae if i use static variables it works fine but then i have my original problem which is that the users would be accessing other users data not an rehashed version is as works for the first method but not for this as new shared property as if not new end return end value as if not end end point onthe locking in the case where ther is more than one webrequest under tha same i ended up using the approach and found that issues were related to the property being a byval instead of i have altered my code to include methods that deal wiht hte objects by ref and now this do i persist an object between threads without using

got subversion with tortoisesvn and setup here for our first mvc so far been working out pretty well so i would recommend to mention they are both free which is of significance depending on your i tried any vs integration because we have some stuff that we use vs for so i just keep it relegated to the file we even really fully configured cruise control but my favorite part is that once i know something is working i can commit it and once i get the notification email that it built successfully i instantly know improved the since switched over to using it has more of a graphical interface and allows you to skip the whole xml file configuration a couple of things to note is based on java but in my experience all that difficult to set up if you take your time and follow the it still works fine for will need to add a hook to svn the equivalent for your source control to have it wget the build you can have it poll svn automatically every few it varies between projects for i have a few set up each use robocopy to move the files by running a batch script after the when files are copied over robocopy produces a different exit code than when it copies no which causes hudson to think there was an i worked around this by simply duplicating each robocopy command i

got to develop an auto scaling arrivals and departures board at started out easily enough with me creating a table with percentage based column widths the overall table being got a small piece of jquery letting me change the scale of my text but its only to prove the really after being able to automatically scale the font and table cell sizes according to the available screen width and i do know the maximum string length allowed for each column cell so i automatically set the size based on some a bit stuck as where to actively developing this now but my initial thoughts calculate maxstringwidth by having a lookup table and the font metrics for a character 1em in size on the cells are all assigned screen percentages so i should be able to read those i can set the font this sound a feasible it also raises questions about the padding above and below each string in each cell but sure i can do someting similar there qualify where there examples of this kind out in the wild my approach you done it can share i shot myself in the and should consider have mentioned using flash to the pm as a means of autoscaling the text as we can then do a lot of the font metrics in only just starting out with that using the flash ide so be limited to that as a development for any examples and departure board using css and

guess you can for the record i leave my paragraph to explain why oracle behaves like that if you have a simple unique index on two will never accept two pairs if the columns are uniquely pair of 1 and a is considered an a pair of two nulls cannot be why it lets you insert as many pairs as you gets indexed because 1 can be next time you try to insert 1 is picked up by the index and the unique constraint is indexed because there is no value to be why it violate the unique

guilty of this it seems to me there be any good reason for a table to not have an identity field primary whether you want to or you can now uniquely identify every row in your table which previously you could not you do sql replication without a primary key on your an extra 32 bits for each row of your for example the case where you need to store user settings in a table in your you have a column for the setting name and a column for the setting no primary key is but having an integer identity column and using it as your primary key seems like a best practice for any table you ever there other reasons besides size that every table just have an integer identity there any good reasons to have a database table without an integer primary	
gurantees that object reference identity of entities assocciated with the same context is the same as database so there is no need to override and because this is the same identity you want to considering object of the reference assocciating a new entity using database generated keys with a context should immideatly persist the entity to the database and set the key of the entity to the generated

gwt event you are using and you wanted a click event you could use the and register your own the object will need to implement the callback which would give you the row events handling you need to handle other type of events other than click gwt currently have a ready interface for you pretty much left on your own to implement them two ways of doing it that i can think of quick and dirty is probably by exploiting which provides a means for you to inject javascript into your gwt i use much jsni from really hard workarounds which is not worth the effort writing it in pure in my code so i show you an but frankly i recommend this as it reduces maintainability and you wanted a gwt you can create a new class that inherits htmltable or at the call the function with your needed for probably need then need the onbrowserevent function that handles the quick template of how the code should look class extends public public void case mouse over handling code best of learning how to code this is by looking at the gwt source code itself for and getting the feel on how to do it the gwt

handlers are not dom the attribute exists in markup only not sure why ff oks go research that now cause i want to seems to be mixed feelings about whether eventhandlers are attributes or looks to me like this is fault as they internally do not treat them as whilst the html spec indicates that they very much the direct consequences of this are that a number of things would consider attributes cannot be set with setattribute in ie including eventhandler bindings and importantly also class and apparently ie8 fixes this but i still installed that so i for event binding use the pair or preferably because a direct set directly to your target method more likely a closure on your fix your styling not being correctly applied use or the problem is avoid using

hardware requirements will somewhat depend on what kind of reliability you want for this if using this to run recommend having at least two machines you split the vms and if using n servers you should be able to get by on of them for the time it takes your vendor to replace the bad the 2 if you want higher reliability less then a san of some kind to store the data on is going to be required the live migration stuff seen is if you can live with the method down both move drives from server1 to power up reconfigure vms to use less memory and start then you really need the san the end of the your biggest sizing will be hd and your hd footprint will be relatively fixed least in most kinds of a and your ram footprint should be relatively fixed as well extra here is always cpu is usually one thing you can skimp on a little bit if you have so long as willing to wait for builds and the other nice thing about going all virtualized is that you can start with a pair of big servers and grow out as your needs need to give your dev environment more get another server and split the vms need to simulate a lower the memory usage of the existing node and spin up 3 this unless i needed very performance i need to consider clustering physical servers for performance go with a virtualized with the extensions on modern cpus and support for the hit is not that big if done

has a good comment on the fundamental there are good commercial solutions doing exactly what you ask they are not free development and may involve recurring with well supported there are also free software but it is more difficult to deliver on all three platforms as you require but more fiddling will add though that installing the runtime is a bit you certainly need to have the separately install a but your program may well need to essentially install the entire runtime in order to depending on what you the flexibility at this level means it can be difficult to programatically determine what bits are and are not which is why the free software solutions usually bother with the somewhat tedious and tricky work of writing a tree shaker to do

has been my experience been involved in fixing database problems for around 30 years and have dealt with hundreds of different that all too many of the problems in database performance are from the inappropriate attempts to reuse functions are far slower than inline cursors reusing a stored proc that inserts one record at a time are far slower than reusing a proc that gives back what you need and ten other fields is wasteful of server and network using an existing view that joins to ten tables when you only need information from three of them is wasteful of server code reuse in databases is not nearly as good a thing as it is in other this is not to say that code be reused if need just that it should never take precedence over databases are unfortunately not well designed to reuse most databases are not object oriented and thinking in designing or accessing them will often result in a poor you can even think about code you need to have a rock solid normalized database you need to think about how you will be extracting as well as inserting data into the you need to think about how well will this work once there are many users and records because redesigning a basic database structure at this point often becomes too expensive and time it is often far easier to refactor the application code than the basic database structure far too the database refactoring does not get if you change the table structure to go from a denormalized table to a parent child structure because you find out the current structure suiting your then you may end up changing hundreds or even thousands of queries against this this is why it is important to spend a lot of time on database you get the chance to revisit it later due to if you think of the database as the foundation of the house and the application code as the structure you will see why this is it is far harder to change the foundation with the structure on top of it than it is to move the internal databases and the applications which access them are the same

has been there appear to be any libraries to manipulate open xml documents in but has complete documentation on the format of open xml what you want is to send a copy of a standard document a form customized for each it should be fairly simple given that a docx is a zip file that contains various parts in a directory have a docx that contains all the parts and tree structure that you want to send to users no real then simply create new modify pieces that contain the content you want and inject it into the zip before sending it to the you could have that contains when a user requests the you replace with the then add the resulting to the zip file would contain all the images and other parts you want in the word and send that resulting document to the that if you rename a file to it is trivial to explore the structure and format of the parts you can remove or replace images or other parts very easily with any zip manipulation tools or programmatically with a brand new word document with completely custom content from raw xml would be very difficult without access to an api to make the job if you really need to do you might consider installing then use or to create your open xml documents using the xml format sdk since you would just be using the to manipulate open xml it should work okay in which seems to support everything the sdk	
has changed the way i browse the basically emacs firefox with javascript based configuration in rather than elisp configuration in built up a huge library of customizations over the years by getting little bits and pieces from just starting with conkeror but the fact that it uses js more widely known than must mean that some amazing stuff out to share your particularly interested in stuff that interacts well with pages produced by django other dynamic web love a action recorder that let me browse a site and find and then immediately save submit the sequence of actions as a bug report with a single by including the js actions required to replicate the it would be the ultimate testing harness even better than selenium because it would be totally keyboard does your look

has recently put a release of their framework on devlabs with a commercial interested on using them in our project some to gradually replace all the custom validation but keen to know about the experience other people have had with it before we commit to you think the framework is sufficiently mature for large and complex commercial problems have you run into while using benefits have you got from it currently more pain than realise that this is a somewhat subjective question as it requires but given that this framework is a very significant part of and will change the way we all write validation i hope that this question will be left open to gather experience on the subject to help me make a decision to a answerable we be starting to use it next that we do not ship a code only a web service so for the majority of code breaking compatibility in terms of the exception type thrown is not a as hoping more people than just me will benefit from this post and its any detail around this area is more than mature is the microsoft code contracts

have a application with stories and categories i know that when you save a new instance of a model with a problems come up because the object is not yet in the this problem usually manifests itself on form which can be neatly worked around with what about a situation where there are no forms to speak in my i want to build an api to accept remote since i like and a whole lot of other messaging in our company is in json outgoing messages from this like to be able to receive the implement a factory that converts the values to but like the factory to be as agnostic as possible to the type of also be converted in the same except that insert ignores id and update gets the already existing instance and overrides remote submitter listens to a feed that gives among other the category objects to so it and refer to them by but it have any direct communication with the real question the most easiest consistent to inflate an instance of a django model object that has a manytomanymanager as far as i can any insert of an object with a field will require two database just because it is necessary to obtain a new id but my current awkward solution is to save the object right away and mark it so that functions down the line can play with it and save it as something a little more it seems like one step up would be overriding so that objects without ids save copy some proxy field to then save best of all would be some robust manager object that saves me the what do you object with manytomany in

have a cobol exe program which calls a cobol dll which in turn calls a cobol program using a dos interrupt the calling program uses an to activate an exe file as if it were typed in as an operating system command line the security program which wraps my cobol code is a third party program which wraps around my the author has suggested that my program read environment variables to insure that the security has not been i have been unable to get my cobol to read the so i thought that writing the program in the variables could be all the present program does is create a small sequential write one record to it and close the file for i have the program wrapped by third party security and it generates the variables i want to verify to allow the progam to write the record weith the contents of the security check as passed or not the calling program cobol then tests for the presence of the reads the record and validates whether the code for security has been written into the cobol program needs to be translated to because the author of the security wrapping code says he interface with cobol present program is small it does is create a small sequential flat text write one record to and then write the record and close the program needs to check for the presence and value of certain variables being generated by a security program which wraps around the little program generating the and runs while the wrapped program is the variable returns the name of the current license thanks for any author of the security software has been unable to provide a small executable to check his so i am looking to create one from scratch which will emulate little cobol program i have been referring to the environment variables of the security program wrapping and securing my little create a write one record to the contents of which depend on the environment and then close in this the calling dll will receive the file written by the small program executed by call to the operating system one which needs to be coded in instead of the present verify its and either allow the main program to procede or the main software consists of over 500 programs which i have ported from mainframe legacy code to i used to use dongles but my clients hated them as they interferred with their dos call which activates the new little wrapped program will work with any executable program so it really is not an simple cobol program needs to be recoded as a program to read environment variables passed by wrapping security

have a data structure something like struct double double double double struct int double i need to store in a relational query relates to the two and they are the same so my first thought was create a table and create a foreign key link between id primary anumber adouble measurements1 foreign key referencing measurements2 foreign key referincing id primary measuredvalue standarddeviation calculatedvalue weightederror the actual context of the data is such that and are measurements of different things apples and which both happen to need a measured standard is it still to store the data for measured apples and measured rockets in the same even though they use the same or would it be more prudent to design it so that rockets and apples have their own id primary anumber adouble applemeasurements foreign key referencing rocketmeasurements foreign key referencing id primary measuredvalue standarddeviation calculatedvalue weightederror id primary measuredvalue standarddeviation calculatedvalue weightederror of these two solutions is do you the first seems less but may have greater potential for there being inconsistent or perhaps is there a better way to solve this problem than thought excuse my pseudodata i really post actual code this we can be certain that rockets and apples will not change their fields so not too worried about the case of if the fields in either rocket or apple change of a based on a data

have a few cynical and contrary opinions on based on my experience working for a large australian organisation with branches all over the country and my current remote work for a us face to face works so you can do deals the this may not be as corrupt or as underhand as it sounds but an astounding amount of decision making happens where people negotiate relative tradeoffs involving favors accrued and owed and stuff which is hard or embarrassing to even when an organisation has a commitment to using groups emerge who negotiate and thus acquire a competitive the purely technical i think is nowhere near as important as the political issue is in drawing this distinction if you label your stuff as and safe to do via remote you are explicitly labeling the other negotiations as somehow not another aspect is that people looking to move up to management need to become visible and a known player in the including are notoriously poor at picking up the cues cited above ask my in a relaxed atmosphere of they can use emoticons and explicitly in im sessions without worrying about translating someone especially across with the ability to search the are far more efficient than verbal or video when discussing if you pick up some nuance at the time someone says you can go back and examine the exact sentence in use video chat infrequently and the main use of voice chat is so i can talk to my boss in his spare time whilst those are good conversations to give me a general feel for how things are going but usually inadequate for

have a form that will be populated by a bunch of information from a and then handed over to the user to fill out the the thing the template and the object that holds the eventual result are because all going into and out of a database i have no schema control so this seems like a great place to just bind all the controls and get on with more important get the controls to bind and this is partly my fault because i wanted to just throw it a have it work out which columns from the row are and keep the values from so frequently throwing it rows that have all the columns the controls and so they throw an but partly fault because doing templatebinder is a bindingsource object with the datasource property set to the datarow i want to trickle throws an exception when i go to show the not really sure what i should do differently the templatebinder contain any datasource until i get the template and if i have to manage the bindings myself instead of setting them and forgetting them at the top of the page not getting much value out of this is just a test to see if what trying to do is even trying to pass the bindingsource a row that contains the values i want to propagate to the suspend switch it out for a blank row from the table so the values i propagated out stay in the properties show the let the user fill it out and then turn on binding again so the bound properties in the controls trickle into the blank row set as the bindingsource i no way because be too but sure be nice if i could do that instead of my old way which involved a switch want to go too far down the rabbit hole a tempting button in visual studio that says just set everything all up but i have experience with visual studio that suggests it like the idea that the schema of the database be changed through visual in i have no idea how to get the flexibility i my demand from this fancy automagic setup even see how to programmatically mess with the connection the code i have is probably less of a sin than killing features because i made a sweeping change behind the scenes that happens to make certain very handy features copypasta can be turned into a function a lot quicker than it takes to rewrite the entire and then what if the database automagic code seems to prefer to throw an exception instead of just swallowing its pride and not doing anything if it have enough information to do stack the i want to make data binding work for me instead of making me throw out everything can binding is more complicated than

have multiple issues here so try to address them separately and you can correct me if i have appear to have a service and a user application that cannot execute certain functionality at the same in order to achieve this you have the service stop the execute the special then restart the if this is correct in my you have a design rather than then restarting the application you should be coordinating access to the shared resource through mutual exclusion using a named mutex using an ipc method such as named pipes to communicate a user token always only valid in the process that called the token handle you received is an index into the handle table of the it is not directly you would need to use duplicatehandle which may be what you want but could be wish to find the best way to get the token to launch the application into the if this is the the best way is to retrieve the session token and use you can check out and the sample in but should be relatively easy to transfer to your language of updated to include windows since you are running the service under the system account it can open a handle to the process itself necessary the process can send its process it can then open the token attached to that duplicate it and use the resultant token to launch the target

have used by turbo power in several but do not rely on it being the only method to protect the you can also use the library to encrypt such as a record stuffed in a database your app containing license registration data that you emailed to the user and they applied via cut and paste into the about strongest way to protect things is to have a piece that the user have access and have your software to validate that its still valid drm this is easy for anyone to block by turning on thier software firewalls and excluding your application from using the of course drm like systems have a bad name right but its partly because they are a frustration point to the end user because they as long as the service which validates the license is

have various solutions with various numbers of projects in all checked in to a team foundation server source control most of them builds as class we now want to use some 3rd party external assemblies in our and i am wondering how to best do cause we of course want to have those assemblies so that everyone can build without and also so that we know where we have so i am thinking that they should be in the source control with the rest of the which they probably should but where do you put stuff like put the first one in a folder in one of the but i see now that that is perhaps a not so good since i would like to use them in many of the other projects as so what do i should i create an empty bogus project for external should i just create a folder for them in source how do you guys organize these how to deal with external

have worked on several rails applications that experienced high load due to viral growth on mongrel count should be based on several if your mongrels make api calls or deliver email and must wait for then you should run as many as try to maintain one mongrel per cpu with maybe a couple extra left sure your server is using a fair proxy balancer round here is the nginx module that does here are some other tips on improving and benchmarking your application performance to handle the most common problem rails applications face is poor usage of activerecord it can be quite easy to make of queries when only one is the easiest way to determine if this could be a problem with your application is to set up after making a request to each major page on your take a look at the newrelic sql if you see a large number of very similar queries sequentially from posts where id select from posts where id select from this may be a sign that you need to use a in one of your activerecord other basic activerecord tips are just the ones i can think of off the top of my not doing it make sure to correctly use indexes on your database making database calls in especially it can be very easy to lose track of how much you are making database queries in push all queries and calculations into your models or making queries in usually this can be done by using an having rails build activerecord objects for large datasets as much as when you make a call like a new class is instantiated for every post in your database it could be a large query in this case you would want to use which will make a single fast query and return an integer without instantiating any like create both a and the latter skips instantiation of activerecord objects and can be much especially when dealing with large numbers of objects this is a good way to speed things and use whenever it will help you keep your code tiny and makes it much easier to have efficient apis much as you do not make api calls to external services while handling a your server will stop executing code until a response is not only will this add to load but your mongrel will not be able to handle new you absolutely must make external calls during a you will need to run as many mongrels as possible since you may run into a situation where many of them are waiting for an api response and not doing anything is a very common problem when building facebook same applies to sending emails in some if you expect many users to sign up in a short period of be sure to benchmark the time it takes for actionmailer to deliver a if not almost instantaneous then you should consider storing emails in your database an using a separate script to deliver like have been created to solve this a good guide on the different methods of caching in performance you suspect a method may be try benchmarking it in an track of methods that are slow in your those are the ones you want to avoid executing in some cases only the first call will be slow since rails has a query you can also cache the method yourself using will also provide a nice overview of how long methods and sql calls take to

i consider the level of advancement pretty much the opposite of your therefore this response might not be directly but i hope at least somewhat any environment that encourages is if i see a lot of a lot of template and especially any use of a big red warning it means the developers have some idea of what correct programming but are constrained by either lack of imagination or politics to using a decrepit junk language such as c is boring and tedious to work but goes out of its way to interfere with check whether a particular technology or concept is treated as a if the prospective employer uses an easy check you can do do they use a real sax or dom is or do they parse it with regexes and serialize it with raw character if the it shows they understand xml is and just using it to have another acronym on the project figure out what language the developers they were using and every good developer has a favorite obscure language it matter whether or factor and a reason for preferring if everybody is content to work in another warning sign that not got much curiosity about programming in

i have no experience developing applications on the 360 or the i have done a lot of research into the various merits of the two i have used for a long time and even though built several mfc and beos applications with build a number of unix server applications with and still the console game environment is significantly cell chip is really quite a beast to as others have said and takes a of talent to properly that being nothing wrong with attending a course if especially if you get to meet people that have developed games before and could give you some you want to develop games for a the best bet for someone with only a rudimentary knowledge of is to use the xna kit for the xbox if familiar with the way that hard to pick in argue a much smaller learning curve than to make the jump to if never developed applications you should steer clear of that sort of thing until two months is not enough are a number of points that make the xna platform very compelling for aspiring console not the least of which is the relative safety of and the fact that xna games can be sold through the microsoft know of many ps3 games that have been developed but there are a few examples on the 360 such as braid that are pretty much solo the xna examples are also quite interesting and

i have the following interfaces and a class that implements them interface following code prints a a as if supports writeln writeln is a little annoying but supports cast to ibase because ibase is not in the list of guids that timplementation it can be fixed by changing the declaration to even without doing that i that a implements ibase because a is an iderived and an iderived is an so if i leave out the check i can cast a and everything will be fine a b a as b now successfully call any of we come across a problem when we start putting ibases into a generic container tinterfacelist for it can only hold iinterfaces so we have to do some a b list a as b list assert assertion i declared dowhatever in this works but it is not would very much like to have some sort of assertion to catch any mismatched types this sort of thing can be done with objects using the is but that work for for various i want to explicitly add ibase to the list of supported is there any way i can write timplementation and the assertion in such a way that it will evaluate to true iff is a safe thing to it came up in the one of the adding the two major reasons i do not want to add ibase to the list of interfaces that timplementation it actually solve the in the this does not mean it is safe to perform a queryinterface may return a different pointer to satisfy the requested for if timplementation explicitly implements both ibase and iderived then the assertion will pass does implement imagine that somebody mistakenly adds an item to the list as an as assertion still passes the item still implements but the reference added to the list is an iinterface only it to an ibase would not produce anything so the assertion sufficient in checking whether the following is the only way guaranteed to work would be to use an or as this is a frustrating performance as it is intended to be the responsibility of the code adding items to the list to ensure they are of the type ibase we should be able to assume this the assertion to catch if this assumption is the assertion even except to catch later mistakes if anyone changes some of the the original code this problem comes from is also fairly performance so a performance cost that achieves little still only catches mismatched types at but without the possibility to compile a faster release is something rather second reason is i want to be able to compare references for but this be done if the same implementation object is held by different references with different vmt expanded the above edit with an the question is how can i formulate the assertion so that the is safe iff the assertion not how to avoid the there are ways to do the step or to avoid it but if there is a runtime performance i use i want all the cost of checking within the assertion so that it can be compiled out said if someone can avoid the problem altogether with no performance cost and no danger that would be how can you check if an iinterface reference implements a derived but not

i notice that you go into some detail about the problem but mention the information provided in section 4 of specification for the deflate compressed data the format used in which leads me to believe you might have missed this basic approach is a chained hash table using sequences as as long as the chain is not all the entries along it are scanned to eliminate false eliminate matches that are too and pick the longest match out of those that their recommendation is shaped by the factor of it may be that they knew of a more effective technique but could not be sure that it was not covered by always wondered why one find the longest matches by examining the matches for the sequences that start at the second byte of the incoming the third and weeding out matches that match if your incoming data is and got hash matches for at offsets 302 and 416 but your only hash match for is at offset you know that unless you have two entirely coincidental overlapping hash matches unlikely then 302 is your longest note their recommendation of optional ironically does more instead of automatically taking the longest match that starts at the first byte of the incoming the compressor checks for an even longer match starting at the next if your incoming data is and your only matches in the sliding window are for and for better off encoding the as a literal byte and the as a

i sometimes find that private inner classes which implement a public interface can be very helpful for objects composed of seen this discussed in the context of creating uis with allen but not much beyond as far as i know it have a say you have a collection interface that can provide an interface public iterator interface public boolean public object you have a stack that implements then you could implement its iterator as a private inner class stack implements public iterator return new private class iteratorimpl implements public boolean public object has complete access to all of private methods and at the same is invisible to all except stack and its iterator will tend to be tightly worst implementing iterator as a public class might force you to break the private inner class lets you avoid either you avoid polluting the class hierarchy with something really an implementation

i strongly recommend that you use getting a syntax check that your parens are balanced as well as your in your you have an the but no you can fix that be just removing the you fix likely get some more errors like not in an aggregate or group because you have several columns that are not in you need to add to your group by or perform some kind of aggregate on is all assuming that there are multiple records with the same threadid not the primary if the then the purpose of the group stumped on the syntax i worked around it with a couple correlated sub i guessed at your table structure so modify as needed and try table threadrating int not userid int not rating int not table thread int not rating int not voters int not trigger on from threadrating i where from threadrating i where inserted on what you then we can check the plan and modify as we might be able to get it to work with the group by to you are updating data that impact ratings in only a few select recommend updating the ratings directly factoring the logic into a trigger is nice but provides lots of problems this can be aided by a your trigger will execute every single time someone touches that things like view last updated will execute this you can add logic to short circuit the trigger in those cases but it gets complicated

i think the answer depends on the nature of the business application that you are what are the slas for your how mission critical is your messaging infrastructure does the application continue to function aside from the lock if then you probably have an obligation to make sure your concurrency control mechanism the single point of the topic of achieving a truly pessimistic locking mechanism requires one to address the of most pessimistic locking algorithms rely on there being a serialized authority that can respond to requests for locks a table or perhaps a singleton lock a design has single point of failure written all over to answer your first seen business applications use messaging to provide pessimistic fully solving the fault tolerance problem seems like overkill for most business applications concurrency control does not have this problem by its nature which is why generally preferred in i realize that business requirements frequently win out over the topic interests google has published an article on their lock which leverages the consensus

i would step in since i write email software for a are two common scenarios for smtp to server and to to public server to server email communication takes place over port if you want your domain to receive email from other then you have to accept smtp traffic at port this is sent as clear there are ways of encoding the specific but as far as the it is sent as ascii text in binary it is not sent over is also some private server to server communication that can take this might take place in large where they might have the internal corporate server that every one when you send an it is sent to the corporate but then this corporate server forwards the email off to a public facing that public facing server sends the email off to a receiving that receiving server is accepting email at port to has more on the server you can configure different submission ports ports you will accept email these can be anything you want them to you just have to remember to tell your users to configure the client software the most common ports are 25 and a lot of isps will block outgoing port 25 that is what spam bots use to send to public mail they have 587 open so you can send email to your smtp the common port for smtp over ssl is this can get a lot more and left out a good bit of but it in a

idea of storing connection strings in a data base is a perverse but please hear me out we all know that best practice to encrypt connection strings in the but what if we just skip the file couple of months ago i was asked to move databases from one server to this meant having to update connection strings in every program that accessed these various this is the 3rd time in 2 years had to move databases from one server to so i thought of storing connection strings in a database and assigning each a guid to be accessed via a web instead of placing connection strings in a you would just need to store the connection string guid in the and reference the connection string web service so that you could request that connection encryption can be done at the application level and connection strings are just stored encrypted in the created a proof of concept and it works fine just on a local intranet and not exposed to the benefit is obvious to such as being able to quickly update connection strings without having to touch the web this means that you could build a web application just for editing connection string in the that a dba could use on there so they never have to bother a programmer when moving the benefit is not what interested interested in what everyone here thinks about doing something like connection strings via a web

if a unit is used anywhere in the it matter how many more times it matter how many places you remove a unit from if still used at least once the compiled program will behave the and it will have roughly the same only difference would be in the order of unit initialization and finalization order affects the order those sections are executed although the precise effect has never been documented try not to rely on initialization i still encourage you to clean up your unit for the same reason encouraged to clean up your variable lists and your parameter when you get rid of the stuff you it makes it easier to read the code kept because you can be reasonably confident that what reading gives an accurate picture of what the code if your code mentions a bunch of units but never really makes use of then the next time you or someone else looks at the a good change going to spend some time trying to find where your code uses the facilities of those say to this code includes but i see where it draws better take another because i think this code had any responsibilities like can you take some time out of your day to tell me where this unit draws

important to understand why the overhead of an http request has such an its simplest an http request consists of opening a sending the request on the open socket and reading the open a the stack sends a tcp syn packet to the the server responds with a and the client responds to that with an before you send a single byte of application you have to wait for a whole one and a half round trips to the at the client needs to send the wait for the server to parse the find the requested send it back another round trip plus some server side overhead a small although seen some slow plus the time to transmit the actual and the best assuming no network congestion which would result in packets being dropped and chance you have to avoid you browsers will issue multiple requests in parallel in an attempt to reduce some of the overhead http requests can theoretically be done on the same making things a little but in network round trips are bad for and should be

in mind that i speak put the most important differentiating factor collection is the single most important factor in differentiating between these c and can be used with it is a afterthought and cannot be made to work as well best known is it has to be which means that it cannot collect all unused is designed from the ground up to work on a gc with standard libraries also designed that it makes an absolutely fundamental difference to developer productivity that has to be experienced to be is a belief widespread among users that gc equates with but this is folklore the boehm collector on performs much better than most people expect it the typical fear is of where the program stops so the gc can do some but in reality these long pauses happen with because they run on top of a virtual memory which occasionally interrupts to move data between physical memory and is also widespread belief that gc can be replaced with but it the irony is that in a is slower than a are environments that are so frugal that gc practical but these are increasingly cell phones typically have the gc that typically runs on appears to be adopting about 18 months ago gone through several phases of pure performance tuning with a and the gc is so efficient that it is practically invisible during the operation of the is not a it solve all programming it only really cleans up memory if allocating very large memory blocks then you will still need to take some and it is still possible to have what amounts to a memory leak in a sufficiently complex program and the effect of gc on productivity makes it a pretty close approximation to a is founded on the notion of undefined that the language specification defines the outcome of certain narrowly defined usages of language and describes all other usages as causing meaning in principle that the operation could have any outcome at all practice this means bugs involving apparently corruption of everything about touches on undefined even very nice forthcoming features like lambda expressions can easily be used as convenient way to corrupt the stack a local by allow the lambda instance to outlive the is founded on the principle that all possible operations should have defined the worst that can happen is an exception is this completely changes the experience of software unsafe which has pointers and therefore undefined but that is strongly discouraged for general use think of it as analogous to embedded assembly terms of has to be singled especially if we consider the standardized new does absolutely everything it can to make itself short of assuming and as a result it has an awesome learning the language designers excuse much of this by saying features are only for library not ordinary but to be truly effective in any you need to build your code as reusable so you the positive is so like a playground for i can assure you that you would have a lot of fun learning how it all fits but i seriously recommend it as a basis for productive new work the wasted on mainstream keeps the language simple in the sense of compiler is easy to but this makes the coding techniques more that not all new language features equate with added some language features are described as because they are shorthand that the compiler expands for this is a good way to think of a great deal of the enhancements to over recent the language standard even specifies some features by giving the translation to statement expands into one it was possible to think of templates in the same but since become so powerful that they are now form the basis of a whole separate dimension of the with its own user communities and strangest thing about c and is that they have a standard interchangeable form of integrating someone code into your project is always a little with obscure decisions to be made about how be linking to the standard library is extremely basic has a complete set of data structures and a way of representing strings but still is there a standard way of finding a list of files in a is there standard library support for parsing or generating what about accessing be writing a web site are you you have to go hunting further for try but does it use to represent of course do all these libraries have their own bizarre customs for naming classes and you situation in be more the fundamentals were in place from the so everything beautifully because the fundamentals are supplied by the there is not all generics should have been in place from the start but which does leave a visible scar on some older but it is usually trivial to fix this also a number of popular libraries are ported from which as good a fit as it first methods with local variable and c are practically the last remaining mainstream languages to lack and libraries can be designed and used much more neatly with them than without is one reason why ported java libraries sometimes seem clunky to a amusing thing about is that its standard library was designed as if closures were available in the language then ten years went and now finally being they will have a huge impact as noted they leak underfined and javascript are the most widely used languages in which closures are major difference between those languages being that is statically typed while javascript is dynamically put this last only because it appear to differentiate these languages as much as you might all these languages can run on multiple oses and machine c is the most then and finally can be used on most major platforms thanks to an open source

in performance of the code itself as has been answered by performance in maintaining the say most programmers expect the variables to be defined at the top of the simple example like you provided and it but a complex function with variable declarations interspersed in the code makes it feel thus slowing down the time to read and grok the thus increasing the time it takes to is also the possible problem with declaring a variable in a loop and not intending thus the variable gets reset with each loop performance of the code itself is often not as important as performance in maintaining the

inference is a feature of some it is done by the compiler to assign types to entities that otherwise lack any type the compiler effectively just the static type information on behalf of the inference tends to work more poorly in languages with many implicit coercions and so most type inferenced languages are functional languages with little in the way of inference is part of the language for the example the spec goes into great detail about the type inference algorithm and as this effectively determines is a legal some languages support some limited forms of type inference in for the most part people use to refer to languages where the vast majority of types are inferred rather than explicit in function and method in addition to local are typically contrast to where allows inference of local variables but method declarations require full type	
inferencing is a bit of a compromise found in some static you can declare variables without specifying the provided that the type can be inferred compile it offer the flexibility of latent but you do get type safety and you have to write as wikipedia

initial look at jersey suggested this was a nice framework that made it easy to create restful java since making the decision to use it with found it to be very poorly consequently it is very hard to perform common tasks sure are very easy once you know griping over but wasted a lot of time on this and my do i inject objects into i know i need to use injectable and related but after reading the it is still unclear how to do is really i have objects that the resources need to and really rather avoid using static fields to expose the objects to the its hard to imagine that anyone has built a jersey app without doing yet having a really hard time finding out anyone point me to some simple examples of how to do prefer not to use that seems like overkill for my do i inject dependencies into resources with

inner classes can be either or if they are they do not contain a reference to the pointer of the containing instance are also not called inner classes they are called nested forgetting to make an inner class when it does not need that reference can lead to problems with garbage collection or escape is possible to make an anonymous inner class as or does the compiler figure this out automatically it because there cannot be any if i make an anonymous i almost never need the reference to the new int string return it possible to make anonymous inner classes in java

input text often has characters which are incorrect for the output things like which come from a document in 147 and 148 in are perfectly valid unicode and your application should be capable of handling them if doing something wrong and most likely all characters will of whether the characters came from someone typing them or someone pasting them in from the browser should be submitting characters to your which should be storing the same bytes to the the browser is not submitting in chances are failing to set the charset of the html page containing the this can be done using header in i just set the attribute on the form and have the browser do it for is basically useless thanks to which misinterprets it to mean using this charset if the one on the page encode the characters we instead of use this this means if you use you can end up with a mixture of encodings submitted at with no way to figure out which is come my database is accepting these which are characters in mysql is just a used for comparison and still storing the data as bytes and really care if not valid a good idea to decode and check incoming sequences in your app because invalid in modern can hide a character that will still be recognised by older browsers least ie6 opera i entered a string containing byte you entered a unicode character the browser deals with unicode not right up until the point it has to submit the serialised form to the then that it decides how to turn the characters into and if the page is being handled as it will always choose not browsers tend to cheat in a for all characters that fit in the encode them to html character references like this is wrong because you now tell the difference between a and a and insidiously wrong because if you then echo the reference as unescaped html it looks like getting it which in fact just made a big old security went into the database as a not or came out when i produced the as no complaints from the it did not come out as a single a browser will complain when given a bare in an xml an html in which invalid sequences come out as a suspect it is coming out as a character which is the character is part of the c1 control so render as anything if this is your form page is not being picked up as after and suffering the problem described

instinct is it would be pretty tough for a programming language library to provide api access to the source to mysqldump is written in with its own designed to operate pretty much as its own it gets built as an and much of the error reporting and output are handled using direct print statements to and not using return values that could be wrapped into a most bindings for a specific programming language are compiled they link against and libmysql contains no reference to the mysqldump i say for sure that no one has written a but it would be a very bizarre wrapper other your best bet is to use a from your programming language of choice to call the mysqldump and absorb the results either from stdin or from a temp

is a huge and employs many techniques to achieve the high compression rates that it is capable video compression is concerned with throwing away as much information as possible whilst having a minimal effect on the viewing experience for an end for using subsampled yuv instead of rgb cuts the video size in half straight this is possible as the human eye is less sensitive to colour than it is to in the y value is and the u and v values represent you can throw away some of the colour information which reduces the file without the viewer noticing any most compression techniques take advantage of 2 redundancies in the first is temporal redundancy and the second is spatial redundancy notes that successive frames in a video sequence are very typically a video would be in the order of frames per and nothing much changes in of a take any dvd and pause then move it on one frame and note how similar the 2 images instead of encoding each frame other compression only encode the difference between successive frames to find the difference between redundancy takes advantage of the fact that in general the colour spread across images tends to be quite low by this i mean that neighbouring pixels tend to have similar for in an image of you wearing a red all of the pixels that represent your jumper would have very similar it is possible to use the dct to transform the pixel values into the frequency where some high frequency information can be thrown when the reverse dct is performed the image is now without the thrown away view the effects of throwing away high frequency open ms paint and draw a series of overlapping horizontal and vertical black save the image as a jpeg also uses dct for now zoom in on the notice how the edges of the lines are not as sharp anymore and are kinda this is because some high frequency information transition from black to has been thrown away during this for an explanation with nice further is quite if a little heavy on the

is a lot of room between the bare metal and you have said you writing an os but not whether or not you are running under an directly on hardware without an you will still want to encapsulate all of your operations in a even if you formally define a device driver interface and framework for all of your modules to this is hugely architecture and makes you responsible for knowing all of the details of interaction with every device you might ever for some this can quickly become a huge development that a problem for embedded but running on commercial hardware this way is neither easy nor within an you probably get want to access to the actual hardware registers and if you are developing a custom the best practice is to make it conform to existing standards so that you need as little low level custom software for it as this is why you see a lot of custom user interface gadgets connecting via usb and identifying themselves as hids interface as a the existing usb drivers take care of the physical and the hid driver takes care of the logical providing a very simple high level access api to the of the operating key roles is to provide a consistent api across all that takes the form of and functions names but some form of at least the first four will always the os layer is quite an os call is forwarded without much processing to a device which then forwards the data on to the the os low level calls block the caller until they and often they have restrictions on the sizes of the buffers that make for raw access to a disk device is usually required to be for an integral number of disk blocks at a forget about things like file systems and network all of which are made much more reliable and compatible by encapsulation within an operating if it is acceptable to call and for single that is usually not the best performance operating system calls are relatively and if you can read multiple characters in a single your performance can go way is the origin of the stdio library for and various other buffering libraries in other the stdio library provides a buffering layer that isolates the c code from the block size of the underlying even on an entirely operating system where you have full control over all the something like c stdio will still be your own stdio replacement is a highly valuable even if you use it in production and is one i would recommend to anyone wanting to learn about what really goes on between and and the terminal or valuable resource is the book standard c by in the author presents an implementation of the complete c runtime library specified in the ansi his discussion of the specific implementation choices he made is valuable and apropos to the context of this and the discussions of why some of the standard library features were specified is interesting as

is a very good and one not limited to orm always feel important to remember some of the problems that an mapping framework if the rest of the application is based on strong accessing data persistence using objects makes the code just that much more internally and sometimes layer an orm provides a clear layer in your application for db it encapsulates all the functions needed to data in one the epitome of the dry not repeat this makes a few things much because all the select and code is in one spot rather than throughout the because all db access goes through one and because easy to mock out your data models and access if they are clearly while easy to secure raw sql use against injection attacks and even easier if you have an orm framework as a single point of that does it for you so you never have to think about that speed is not on the an orm is a level of indirection between your code and the we certainly hold orm designers responsible for writing a framework that produces good sql but an orm is meant to provide and not executional a developer who has read a basic book on sql will always be able to get better performance talking directly to the are certainly strategies to counter and in django those are as ozan has and but they give you the same performance as a direct sql because of i would never use an orm framework that does not provide some mechanism for issuing a raw sql statement on those occasions when i need for i often resort to raw sql when generating a large report out of the database that joins many the orm way can take the sql way can take said i never start by worrying about each individual my advice for anyone coming to an orm layer nanny the database write your application or and then profile tweaking those areas that truly need the performance or using to reduce the overall of your

is my current have a web page containing a couple scrollable each of those divs contains a number of i am using yui to display popup menus of actions that can be performed on each each object has its own menu associated with it that is constructed and displayed the popup menus can be large and can overlap the bounds of the scrollable what i believe are issues with focus menus must be when i hover the mouse over an action that lies on top of an edge of the scrollable the div automatically moving the content but leaving the menu trying to move the menu dynamically when this happens is not something i want to do as i believe it would provide a poor user i need to prevent this focussed menu from scrolling the my idea for providing the best user interface is to prevent these inner divs from scrolling when a menu is this leaves the menu positioned in the optimal location to show the user which item is being acted if the user wants to scroll the they can click to close the menu and then scroll can i do i need a solution that works across the major first thought was to listen to the event for that particular there does not seem to be an easy way from there to just prevent the scrolling from for my javascript event code appears to execute after the actual scrolling has i thought that since my code is being run after the object has i could just reset and sure this appears to though i am worried that on slow browsers the user will see the content inside the div it would be really nice if the amount the element scrolls is part of the event is it stuck in there looking for an alternative to having to store the scrolltop and scrollleft variables for this element and then using them while the scrolling is temporarily is the best way to solve this entire can i temporarily prevent a scrollable div from

is not spammer if someone looks at the code for your site and determines the pattern that you are using for your email then specific code can be written to try and decipher know that i would say it is but it prevents which is quite a big with you simply get that what if you want to copy a relatively complex email address to your address book in you have to resort to typing it out which is prone to the responsibility to the users spam filters is really a poor while i believe that users should be diligent in guarding against that absolve the person publishing the address from that trying to do this in an absolutely secure manner is nearly the only way to do that is to have a shared secret which the code uses to decipher the encoded email the problem with this is that because the javascript is interpreted on the client there anything that you can keep a secret from for email addresses nowadays generally work because most email bot harvesters going to concern themselves with coding specifically for every they are going to try and have a minimal algorithm which will get maximum results payoff worth it because of simple encoders will defeat most but if someone really wants to get at the emails on your then they can and probably easily as since the code that writes the addresses is publically all this into it makes sense that facebook went the image because they can alter the image to make ocr all but they can virtually guarantee that email addresses be given that they are probably one of the largest email address repositories in the it could be argued that they carry a heavier burden than any of and while are forced down that route to ensure security and privacy for their vast user

is the beginning of another possible solution in perl works as is but could probably be made more sophisticated if it sounds as if all you are concerned about is removing duplicates across the corpus and really care if the last part of one article is in the file for the next one as long as it duplicated if this solution will strip out the duplicate lines leaving only one copy of any given line in the set of files as a can either just run the file in the directory containing the text files with no argument or alternately specify a file name containing the list of files you want to process in the order you want them i recommend the latter as your file names least in the sample files you do not naturally list out in order when using simple commands like on the command line or in the perl thus it necessarily compare the correct files to one another as it just runs down the list or generated by the glob if you specify the you can guarantee that they will be processed in the correct order and it take that long to set it up script simply opens two files and makes note of the first three lines of the second it then opens a new output file file name for the first file and writes out all the lines from the first file into the new output file until it finds the first three lines of the second there is an off chance that there are not three lines from the second file in the last one but in all the files i spot checked that seemed to be the case because of the journal name header and page one line definitely enough as the journal title was often the first line and that would cut things off should also note that the last file in your list of files entered will not be processed have a new file created based off of as it will not be changed by this the open close else glob if ne print open my close my if my my open my close my open my my while 1 and if else print out close added a check for parenthesis in the first line that goes into the regex check for duplicity later on and if found escapes them so that they mess up the duplicity

least solaris has a limit of 256 file pointers because the structure stores the file descriptor in an unsigned char this is retained for backwards compatibility with some almost impossibly old versions of other platforms tempted to say most other platforms do not share that on the other it is relatively unusual for an ordinary user program to need that many files open it more often indicates a bug closing the files when finished with than having said it can be a problem for things like database servers which need to have lots of data files open at the same comment almost we have a large number of files but the server handles a large number of connections from socket handles and file descriptors seem to come from the same when we have a lot of fails because the call returns and fd are file descriptors at the system call so they come from the same place as regular file descriptors for you have to work around then you need to wrap your current socket opening code so that if it gets an file descriptor in the range then it calls to create a file descriptor in the range that stdio use and then close the original file the only snag with this is that you have to keep track of which file descriptors are because will merrily close the target file descriptor if it is currently assuming your socket code reads file descriptors and not file if the you have bigger problems too many things want to use the same resources and they all use them at the same	
least with and intializers not really able to do anything just a new way to write although it does look like object initializers compile to slightly different angle that really blows my mind about extension methods is that you can put them on an that means a class can inherit concrete code by implementing an and since a class can implement multiple interfaces that in a roundabout sort of that now has something like multiple so a new feature that should definitely be handled with

like using both dynamically allocated arrays and when i believe just using will be let your input array be changed to a and fill it with your input for data data important to declare your mergesort function to take a reference to a the rest of your note that now you are passing in your array for so you can continue with your code to the vector into farray and then call sort on your guessing at this point write code to combine your farray put it back into forget to clear original array a looks like not doing an inplace so expect your sort to take a while since copying out a lot of

limits seem to apply to the current i assume they will allow larger databases in the after they figure out how they can serve the demand even with the a database of 10gb that supports high scalability and reliability is a useful and that scalability refers to the ability to keep a and shallow performance while the volume of data or the volume of requests it does not necessarily mean optimal nor does it mean very high capacity data simpledb also offers a service so you can store up to transfer up to using up to 25 hours of machine while this limit sounds very the fact that free allows some customers to use the without investing in a big server

linked tables break when the table or view on the server is some changes can result in them just becoming others will simply not include all the have found that updating the connect string does not successfully fix this it will usually fix missing but it can still be the only reliable way to do this is to recreate the linked table on the alternative would be to not use a linked table at but use a saved querydef that has the appropriate connect this will never have to be but could be a performance issue as the metadata stored in the table link helps access figure out how to retrieve the without that metadata stored in the table it has to retrieve that information from the server each time the query is

lisp applications from command lisp implementations support a or mechanism that will encapsulate a body of code and run functions at as another poster these mechanisms are and lisp implementations have a so a conventional approach to deploying a lisp application is to wrap a shell script around the script must set up the program environment and pass command line typically the runtime context includes application files to load asd or and one or more forms to evaluate or functions to extending can roll your own or you can some existing take a look at which is useful for several below for more about clbuild functionality and can extend clbuild to run your own application with command line for to load the system and run the function you would invoke clbuild as run any 1 2 the character escape syntax for this is needed for most command alternative approach is to redirect standard input from a for run any functionality and is most commonly used to install and run open source commonlisp is a bash so it is highly the download facility relies on programs like and default clbuild runs sbcl but it is very easy to configure it to run another lisp such as cl copy to and edit to point to the lisp executable you want to	
lisp implementations have excellent garbage a special problem is that lisp applications often have a high allocation rate of small objects are a few things to conservative not a huge fan of conservative gcs for a problem of conservative gcs is that they find all this can be a problem for long running programs and lead to fragmentation and not reclaimed unused precise gcs are using the tag information of lisp data and can identify every data type of every conservative gcs were invented for programming language implementations that use tagged data compacting to work against memory fragmentation in long running a gc that compacts and localizes objects can be a problem sometimes comes up when hashtables need to be rehashed the location a copying gc may need more memory there is a from and a to space of but when the gc copies the objects from one memory space into it automatically makes it more more advanced gcs on the lisp can also sort objects and allocate objects of the same type near each other assuming that this will speed up accessing this means that there is a first gc stage that exclusively runs in main memory and gets some support from a memory management unit to identify changed memory scanning main memory is fast than scanning virtual memory and scanning only changed memory regions reduces the amount of work when lots of objects are allocated and quickly turning into this gives very short gc usually gcs nowadays are there is more than one generation and objects that survive a few gcs are promoted to an older usually only the first generation is gced very gcs lispworks and allegro cl have a lot of tuning especially for applications it makes sense to read the manual and for example tune the number of their sizes and other gc over virtual memory is usually very avoid that if possible add more ram to the memory for example the web server does some manual memory management using these are pools of objects that can be reinitialized very the lisp machines were using this a typical use of them is in read buffers for instead of creating new strings by every read it is useful to use reusable some common lisp allow stack allocation of some data leaving the block then automatically frees the this assumes then that the memory is no longer referenced on leaving a none of the usual common lisp implementations has a concurrent gc and support for concurrent lisp some implementations have concurrent lisp but the gc will stop them all while it is the if you are not sure where allocation happens and what the gc you need to find that out using profiling your lisp has a precise generational gc which runs in main memory it is hard to get problems with long clozure cl free common lisp for example has a very good gc you want to avoid memory fragmentation and garbage collections in virtual if necessary use a 64bit lisp implementation with more main and configuring the garbage can see from the documentation that lispworks and allegro cl have lots of knobs for tuning lisp has a few functions that deal with the implementation is a function that gives an overview of memory gives more detail 2 generation total size allocated free 725k segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion generation total size allocated free 871k segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space generation total size allocated free 1585k segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion generation total size allocated free 128k segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion size allocated free

looking to stay with your existing ftp server setup then advise using something like inotify or daemonized process to watch the upload if ok with moving to a different ftp you might take a look at which is a python ftp server been a part of the dev team for pyftpdlib a while and one of more common requests was for a way to files once finished because of that we created an callback method triggered on completion of an upload on our issue tracker for comfortable in python then it might work out well for you to run pyftpdlib as your ftp server and run your processing code from the callback note that pyftpdlib is asynchronous and not so your callback method be if you need to run tasks i would recommend a separate python process or thread be used for the actual processing

main with c for writing reliable and easy to extend programs is that in c you can do the first step would be to write a simple framework that restricts just a most good programmers do that this the restrictions would be mostly to make it easy to define a within whatever level of isolation you has a reputation of being and threads also need significant time to so you might want to use a cooperative which can be far more and you could even make it preemptive think what erlang to get set a pool of threads and make all of them complete to run the important part would be to create an appropriate library of immutable data so that using them of the standard your functions would be just a matter of setting a good api for message passing and not but at least it seem like changing the language

make this easier to i will present the exact same problem as if it was about a forum actual app have to do with forums at but i think such a parallel is easier for most of us to the actual app is about something very specific that most programmers understand an app intended for hardcore graphic suppose that there is a thread table that stores information about each forum thread and a threadrating table that stores thread ratings per user for efficiency i decided to cache the rating average and number of votes in the thread table and triggers sounded like a good idea for updating it used to do such stuff in the actual application but i think triggers are worth a despite the debugging you ms sql server support a trigger to be executed per it has to be per so i tried defining it this trigger on update set from inner join inserted group by i get an error for the clause i the question how can i make this if the question is but the first time i actually try to use the thread table would contain threadid primary rating and some other fields that are irrelevent to the current threadrating table only contains threadid userid key to the primary key of the users and rating between 1 and error message is syntax near the keyword sql server trigger to update item rating and number of

makes it pretty easy to spit report tables out in multiple including also a activerecord hook that gives your models a reporting	
makes no sense to do this on an primary key as even if it was trivial to without mass updates in related tables you affect your data to do so you would likely need to drop the index and primary key constraint from the column which point your application may flake renumber all later renumber all related then the primary key constraint and you really must have some form of linear identifier which always starts at 0 may then indicate a problem with the software then you can have a secondary id column in addition to the primary which you then update to shuffle higher values down a rung with a statement such secondaryid secondaryid secondaryid secondaryid from table where primaryid to from primaryid to strongly discourage such a practice if your ids are values because of deleted the software should test for existence of these values rather than just wigging

management studio has snippets in you can use management studio on sql 2000 and	
managers see the advantages of unit testing until they see it in action where it makes so my based on is to take the ff unit tests to recurring this is the best use case to prove the value of unit when you have bugs that just appear and reappear every other the unit test will allow developers to see which changes caused the aside from alerting them in advance that a fix is in quite easy to demonstrate to management as unit tests to regular with the usefulness of unit tests now clearly several instances of recurring bugs disappearing in the long term should be enough to encourage everyone to use unit tests to evaluate to prevent them from becoming recurring unit tests to new with unit tests making sure that old bugs and confirm that they are fixed in the first the next step would be to apply it to new functionality to ensure that bugs will be make it clear that it is impossible to totally eliminate full blown the final step will be to apply unit testing even before as a design tool that both helps in designing code and minimizing course not saying that this is easy what i had stated above is an oversimplification which even i struggle with everyday difficult to convince later you decide to move on to a different you may want to explicitly look for a company that practices

many good interview the question is phrased a little to force the interviewee to ask clarifying questions and state i think a number of the other answers here are as they poke at these assumptions and demonstrate assuming the text is stored but there is a way to iterate over each word in the text without loading the whole text into the code below find the top n only data structure is a mapping of pairs and it only keeps the top n of so the memory use is which is the runtime is which is but acceptable given the problem the gist of the algorithm is for each word in the count how many times it and if in the running then add it to the list and remove the previous minimum that the actual program below loads the entire text into merely for convenience of some boilerplate to grab a big piece of text off the web for httpget let req let resp let stream let reader new let data data text httpget words perhaps actually stored in but so long as we can over all the words in the text n 5 how many words we want to findmin map pair with mininum value in a let k v map k v if v mv then else let mutable freqcounts for word in words let mutable count for x in words if x word count count let findmin if count mincount freqcounts word count if freqcounts n freqcounts minstr freqcounts

me a while to track down this error but i finally found out i am modeling a card game using the rails currently my database looks like games id the rails activerecord and currently look like card game i attempt to run a game and there are multiple games than i get the in duplicate entry for key insert into values time the action cardid i has something with how rails inserts the data into the since there is no cardsgames i think it is just pulling into id and inserting it into the this works fine until you have two games with the same which violates the primary key constraint on being affluent with my first solution to this problem was to try to force rails to follow a definition of this relationship by dropping id and making cardid and gameid a primary it work because the migration seem to handle having two primary keys the rails api saying that its okay to do another solution for this is to omit the column in the insert into statement and let the database handle the auto i know how to do this is there another for is there some nifty rails trick that i just or is this sort of structure not possible in this is really frustrating because i what is wrong and i several ways to fix it but due to the constraints of the rail i just cannot do key issues in

me explain the basic layout title banner an be footer use entire width for text and con con1 con2 con1 con2 con3 will contain one or two images and will not be will contain text and some form elements enabling the user to will contain some links and some three of the above mentioned parts will have one column could be no columns two columns three columns or four columns is the main content where n could be the empty string or content could be in columns with a navigation menu there is also a special case where there is no navigation menu column and a single columns will be separate no text beginning in col1 will continue in rather col1 might hold text and col2 some unrelated information like a list of the latest about the 4 is most tought the width could be fixed and around we specify the width using em to make the layout more scalable for different font the web site will be launched in about a year from now we skip support for ie6 and focus on firefox and safari to be on the markup and css for version of and css would you you think a version for devices with small screens could simply be based on a custom css or would it need differences in the layout suggestions for a layout and some more general

me it seems boost has the most traction for new libraries and the fact that many of them got accepted into the upcoming standard speaks for use ace and boost myself and the reasons i chose them are that they are mature have a large strong user community which makes sure they will be maintained and enhanced and that i can get good quality professional we use for our support and are highly ace is a much older library than boost and one of goals is to support more exotic platforms it does not use so much bleeding edge technology as i am using a mixture of ace and boost and am very happy with that quite know why you put wxwidgets in the as it is mostly a graphics ui but if i had to do some ui projects i would go with mostly because this is also a widely used library of the kde desktop is built on top of and therefore well maintained and i would have access to a large user base for questions and	
me it seems easier to think of what you should not put dynamic such as an file and per project it is really annoying when your app loses sync with the registry system and retrieves information that is not valid possibly deadlocking the an earlier job i saw a guy that stored a data transfer completness percentage writing the new values at every 10k or so and having the gui retrieve this value every second so it could show on the

me preface all this by the fact that none of this is truly i am talking about pseudo random number me also say that i have never had to do this for production quality i have done this for a hw assignment in i simulated poisson random way that i did it made use of the following poisson random variable is a sum of exponential random can use the inverse transform method to generate exponential random you can use the fact if are independent exponential random then z 1 is with i wrote the following code in python to generate poisson values by using random def def sum n while sum n sum return usage of the class generates a random value that is posted this here because it is good to know that these kinds of relationships and this inverse transform method gives you a general way to deal with generating random values following a particular continuous

most basic case is your login controller simply handing a snapshot of the array to the other in this your login controller will need to have references to instances of the other and it will set some property of those instances to the remember to declare the properties with the so that the receivers hold on to your private mutable you want the other controllers to be able to modify the let them have your mutable an invitation to need to implement one property on the login instead of one property on each of the other the login property should have at least a getter and setter you can but you can implement specific accessor for you have this the other controllers should access the property in a if you implement the specific they can just use need to send to the login when they access the contents of that proxy they really access the login when they mutate the proxy they mutate the login array in comes the actual kvo want the other controllers to know when one of them the login changes the have each controller the login add itself as an observer of the property of the login remember to have them remove themselves in their order for the right notifications to get everything needs to use either accessors or that goes for the login controller should use its own accessors when mutating the instead of messaging the array the only exceptions are in and the accessor messages would be messages to a which will be a problem if you ever make the accessors it sounds like you may have way too many see if you of your logic into model objects that drastically simplifies your as cocoa is designed to work with a model being is fighting the which makes more work for i mean doing things other than or in addition to the normal behavior of a given accessor for normally just if you insert or store the object somewhere other than in an array in an instance or if you do something else in the same method as tell a view that it needs to then your accessor method is	
most common method for topology detection in ip networks is to send packets echo to destination adresses with very small usually the last valid node you reach with a given dll will then respond with an icmp error telling you that the packet was lost due to its end of thereby revealing the ip address of said answer suggests that the java socket api can only set the ttl on multicast to work around you could try to work with raw ip using a third party library like since there is no raw ip support in the jdk on from requesting it was close

my comp sci degree first of all you have to ask yourself the what type of search do you want to offer the if the user will clearly know what they are looking for example a product based website then you should provide a search engine based on for example users will be searching for a specific or product this is generally quite easy to next is your familiar web search engine such as google here targets a completely different the typical user know exactly what they are looking they just know that they are looking for something to do with aeroplanes for now google has to try and figure out what is the result that is most likely to match that and be the most know google has an incredibly complex and optimised system but from memory if you want to go this way you need to create something called an inverted index then you need to start thinking about a thesaurus because what if the user types in then you should also provide results that contain the word also word because the user typed in cat the cats result will also be am pretty sure that if you are providing a search engine for your website then it most likely be a metadata search engine in which case you can roll your own if not and you are looking for the second type then why not use they provide a custom search that will work within your own

new to wpf and know how to implement what i got a data bound wpf gridview displaying the results of an sql of the columns present repeated data that like to name bob ted look like name bob ted on bound the listview to a dataview i have a data template for the cells to control the tenative thought i should apply a trigger to the template and change the properties to make the text empty on all rows after the first where the data is the same as the previous i setup the trigger can i perform this all in xaml or do i need to write code to access the previous in xaml how do you construct the binding to reference the columns in the current and previous rows of the dataview bound will it choke on the first row since there is no previous the template working columns use i have to write code does anyone know of a decent tutorial that would get me solutions are though i think a style that i could apply to many columns would be the optimal for your hiding repeated

nice design pattern of this is the object it can be applied in a context want to handle a key abstraction in different contexts and you do not want to put the resulting interfaces into the same class want to handle the available roles dynamically so that they can be attached and removed on that is at rather than fixing them statically at want to treat the extensions transparently and need to preserve the logical object identity of the resulting object want to keep pairs independent from each other so that changes to a role do not affect clients that are not interested in that pattern used three a your that concists of a which essencially manages the roles and that provides role specific etc are the roles in your

not a dns and do any dns all the responsibility of the browser viewing the page there are several circumstances that can lead to inconsistent urls being served in the which may be interpreted differently by the will always interpret a url beginning the same way an absolute so the destination will always resolve to the same make sure all your urls to your main site begin beginning will be treated as relative urls if the page containing the url is at essentially asking for find this almost certainly the behaviour looking beginning with a leading slash will be treated as absolute on the current for example within google will result in a request to if no leading the browser will treated the url as being relative to the page currently being viewed a url of when viewing a page in the folder would result in a request to think this is where your problems are for consistent i find a good rule of thumb to ensure all urls begin with a leading if you want to ensure all your hyperlinks generated by your asp code are use the tilde asp will replace with the path to the application root it matter where your page is in your site whether using a web site in iis or a virtual directory in iis the url will always resolve to the correct you want to output a url that a property of a server use the resolveurl this

not asking for anyone to do this homework for but i bring it up because a very good practical introduction to and but at the same time i feel perhaps a little too this really the best way to teach what key threading concepts are in this what would new programmers using threads for the first time likely fail to have alot of theoretical knowledge about threading but had to do alot of it myself in the does anyone have any caveats for me when writing the link to the original here is the goals create a circular queue class and create a to use it next in thread safe means that operation that changes contents of the queue should executed by only one thread at a in order to avoid data circular queue is implemented as fixed size array where the and end of the queue are indices the as the queue fills beginning and end of the queue shift to higher values as elements added and eventually wrap around the first index in the array to the this class should throw an exception to the caller if the operation create a gui to two threads in a the gui will be able to and start and stop both the and consumer threads and control rate at which they modify would you this homework

not really lines of code that get often a development style that makes things example a very long method body makes it difficult to almost always it means that some things have to be implemented separately maybe even in other have all around 10k lines files and they are really difficult to but not because of so many because the methods contain a crazy amount of logic not put more than one class in a file nested classes if you need it will automatically limit the file not give to a class more logic than its responsibilities it will limit the file you are with use partial classes to separate the files in several physical this will also more important keep your logic simple and

not that is that vast libraries and frameworks exist that can help you do your this is true for many programming look at cpan for for what language to use depends in great part on what your goals can start simple and work your way up to larger and larger is by no means too complex for a but learning any form of web programming is a lot to learn when all if you were looking at for the same there is a lot there you are doing ignore all of j2ee except for jsp and jms and a very few other the share of j2ee is only useful in the context of an enterprise application that needs to and in fact can be harmful when used in smaller frameworks such as web and so on help you do your but are yet more things to learn to do your there is a lot to you use quite a lot of development is done with lamp linux mysql with you need to worry about java or or any of those works very well for a wide class of and on the server are more appropriate for larger but once you are familiar with they work just fine for smaller services as have to decide what your exact goals then look at how people have implemented the kind of thing that looking at this will help you figure out what technologies are the most necessary for the niches looking at going

not use xml entities to define terms that have to be localized and them have separate dtds for each this is essentially the approach used by firefox for on	
not valid and is not valid xml is not valid xml because the and are not valid characters inside attribute they need to be escaped using the corresponding xml entities and is not valid html either because the short closing form is not allowed in html is correct in xml and the tag is also an implicitly closed tag as per the html this means that manually closing it is actually and is equivalent to closing any other tag correct version in html the correct version in xhtml and xml following example you gave is also is not valid html or xml the name of the tag must be right behind the although the attributes and the closing may be wherever they so the valid xml is another funkier you can actually choose to use either or as your attribute quoting is single quoted and the other reasons that were posted are but the biggest problem with parsing html is that people usually understand all the syntax rules the fact that your browser interprets your tagsoup as html means that you have actually written valid and even agrees with me regarding the definition of valid and your invalid is not while my corrected version xml is not made to be parsed with but there is also no reason to do there are many xml parsers for each and every you have the choice between sax dom parsers and pull all of these are guaranteed to be much faster than parsing with a regexp and you may then use cool technologies like xpath or xslt on the resulting dom reply is not only is parsing xml with regexps but it is also a bad just use one of the millions of existing xml and take advantage of all the advanced features of is just too hard to even try parsing on your first the legal syntax has many little subtleties that you may not be aware and html in the wild is just a huge stinking pile of get my there are a variety of lax parser libraries that do a good job at handling html like tag just use

nt file system does not delete a file when you think it when you delete a file on an nt file system the operating system simply marks the disk space that file occupied as the file will not be truly deleted until another file is written to that location on to why windows would think it was the same exact file i believe this is due to the fact that the file was empty when you deleted it so creating a new file in the same location with the same name and the same contents makes windows think it is in fact the same i would consider this to be a a side the fact that windows handles file deletes in this way is the very reason that you are able to use utilities to recover deleted

observe a phenomenon that looks like religion to only in a development here is an example are three people working on a small the project will involve a public web service that will serve requests by fetching data from a and also a separate component that would fill and update this all three of us care a lot to make this project but we come from different one of us has only done java development enterprise java while two of us have only done choosing what to develop the project as you may each one stood his ground and insisted we use the technology he knows other than we are good and we are determined to work not a but think that two of us being more productive is a good argument to use the java guy on the other hand is also an and thinks that using free tools would be decisive for the started with a using for development and a mysql which appeared to be a huge not because we make it but because of all the overhead to make the two it would have been a snap if we used with sql server or php and mysql those pairs are just made to work with each real problem in this case is that whatever we at least one is going to make a compromise and not be and of the whole which is not how do we work this how do we work out religious differences between i know that every good programmer have a problem working with a foreign but i need such what if any of us converting is not an out religious differences between developers in a team

of the confusion between various cocoa references comes from the introduction of views in on the all uiviews are where in leopard views need to manually enable a content is drawn once using whatever you supplied in but then is buffered into the the layer acts like a rectangular so when you move the view or cover no redraw is the texture is just moved to that location via the unless you set the to for a changing the size of the layer its containing will simply scale the this may lead to blurry graphics within your view or so you may want to force a redraw in this will trigger a manual redraw of the or and a subsequent recaching of that content in the optimal suggested that you avoid having frequent calls to because quartz drawing and recaching in a layer are expensive best to try to do animation using separate layers that you can move around or references seen that relate to the desktop may assume which do call any time the view needs to be whether from or having part of the view as i all uiviews are so this is not the case on the for your drawing one way to do it would be to maintain an array of drawn objects and call each time the user adds something iterating over each of the previously drawn objects in i might suggest an alternative approach where you create a new uiview or calayer for each drawing the contents of that drawing operation would be drawn by the individual view or that you have to redraw everything on a new and you might be able to do some neat editing by moving each of the drawn elements around independently of the for complex there might be a bit of a memory tradeoff in but bet that it would have much better drawing performance cpu usage and

of the largest pitfalls of code coverage is that people just talk about code coverage without actually specifying type of code coverage they are talking the characteristics of c2 and even higher levels of code coverage are so just talking about even make achieving full path coverage is pretty much if your program has decision you need tests depending on the every single bit in a value is a decision so to achieve full path coverage for an extremely simple function that just adds two you need 18446744073709551616 if you only have you already need achieving c0 coverage is important thing to is that code coverage does tell you what code was it only tells you what code was you can try it out take a codebase that has code remove all the assertions from the now the codebase has but does not test a single code coverage does not tell you only not w

of the most common mantras in computer science and programming is to never optimize meaning that you should not optimize anything until a problem has been since code is likely to sometimes you might know that a particular way of doing things will perform when is it ok to optimize before identifying a what sorts of optimizations are allowable right from the using as few db connections as and paying close attention to that while rather than using a new connection as needed and worrying about the performance cost optimizations are ok to do right	
of the most common mistakes you could make to produce this error is to attempt to persist two different java classes in hibernate likes there being exactly one kind of thing in each table some exceptions for subclasses and the and so if you were to create a class called maybe studentrecord and a class called and if you then told hibernate to persist both of those classes into a table called you could produce that kind of with that particular i suspect using annotations which case even easier to accidentally name two described in two different java the same this perhaps as i have noticed just now that you asked this question 7 months i do hope not still

of the things the optimizer uses is histograms on the related if you are using a bind variable and if you have histograms on the related column the plan may change depending on the parameter this first plan will stay in the shared pool and will be used for all you do not want this then you can use literals instead of binds you will not have too many versions of the same or you can remove the removing the histogram ensures that independent of the bind parameter value the same plan will be the sql for every execution is not a good depending on how often this sql is used it may cause new problems like latch problems caused by hard

of your reasons for wanting to learn it is always good to know more languages because it broadens your mind so learning is a valuable lesson in you can either run it as a application or it is just a compiler switch in visual studio however there are quite a lot of syntax differences between the i personally think learning both flavors is to choose in your projects depends a bit on the requirements if your program needs to interact other managed modules like modules written in it is preferable to use to avoid some overhead switching between managed and unmanaged

once heard a saying something like your class is getting too big and too then refactor it into a couple or a few smaller would strongly suggest you take something along this approach until you are more this will allow you to really get a feel for when functionality needs to be broken if you try to your project without any experience to guide then you are sure to make lots of i found that some people get so caught up in the principles and practices they start implementing designs that are very by speculative i mean that they might think later on we might want to add robust so they design everything to support the anticipated features list quickly grows and you will find yourself designing for all kinds of you will run into problems like do i get this particular class to both be compatible with my future authentication service and my future monitoring you will bang your head against the wall trying to solve problems which are not even relevant to your first you take my advice it is important that after you get a prototype up in that you then take a serious look at your now is the time that you can look at larger and ask yourself if they make one test is to imagine how easy it would be to explain the usage of the class to someone if it is complex or then a redesign may be in if they are too big and serving more than one then breaking it apart is probably important thing to remember about design practices is that certain techniques should only be applied where try to force your application into a certain architecture or design if it fit you will learn these things with experience and the best thing you can do is spend too much time over thinking if you dive right you will find plenty of opportunities to reflect on your you obviously have the right mindset already of trying to do things the which is just over do are lots of and out

one difference to keep in has but haskell does which for one that you more things by simply looking at a haskell a haskell function takes a value of a type and returns that same value of that same you give it a it will return a give it a it will return a give it a it will return a you be so this is that in t because of subtyping you could call it like pers is of type the argument to the function is in fact might have a more specific type than just could even be an abstract guaranteeing that will have a more specific you can even with a function as simple as the type system already allows for a lot more than the stricter type system from while that might be useful to do some programming it also makes it harder to reason about a program by just looking a the types of things is a joy to do in a second there is polymorphism in via a mechanism known as eq a a a function checks if two values are but not just any two just the values that have instances for the this is sort of like constraints on type parameters in bool t where t is a for one the you could instantiate it with and call it with and there is also a difference in what this compiles the code compiles to almost exactly what its type the type checker makes sure the arguments implement the proper and than the haskell code complies to something like eqdict a a function gets an a dictionary of all the functions it needs to do the how you could use this and what it compiles equals 2 4 b1 equals inteqfunctions 2 equals true false b2 equals booleqfunctions true also shows what makes subtyping such a imagine if this where equals somestudent b3 equals personeqfunctions somestudent is the dictionary supposed to figure out if a is equal to a they even have the same while haskell type constraints at first sight might look like type they are implemented completely differently and compile to two really different

only agile projects i have ever worked on were either in time and materials or pay per cycle trouble as you have pointed that there is a risk of a project that the same as any if you go you take all the if you go fixed price the customer takes all the by going pay per cycle you are taking most of the but are passing small chunks of it onto the customer one cycle at a as it happens neither you or the client want to take any risk at which is why you have posted this trouble is taking risks is what business is all the more risk you take the bigger the profit when it comes but also the bigger the loss if it if the risk is too great for you to handle the only solution is to find someone else that can take the risk off your but you are going to have to pay if neither you nor the client are prepared to take it then there are probably only two some rich fool to underwrite the risk get the risk out amongst a number of people until the risk each one takes is so small that it is think this second option is what makes contactors so because they are easy to get rid they end up taking the risk of an early project as the risk would be spread between a number of the risk is spread to an acceptable they will charge you more than an employee because of the extra but that is what you get for trying to avoid the risk

only sends the differences over the not the entire when doing however the initial checkout of the files do require a download of all the which will basically mean download also binary files are a nightmare to merge so as long as you work in a master slave environment where only 1 person can commit and the others are slaves who only update the files this will work very otherwise likely to end up with conflict after it not possible to split the 10gb over multiple repositories do they really need to be versioned as a whole

only way i could find to even come close to generating this behaviour was to create a menu in the overflow which contained a single menu item whose header was itself another menu item called and containing the proper it worked as intended but looked bizarre could be remedied by custom and also seems like a huge the only way to do this that i can think of would be making your own control which pops up a contextmenu or popup when hovered since i think that a custom controltemplate can change the default behaviour of a menu so as not to require a click on the top level

only way to go about doing this would be to parse your string manually in your query and insert the values into a memory then join the memory table in your query rather than using the an page on presents this from sysobjects where id drop function function declare while set set insert into values could then use it like ids on the generally not a great practice to take but if then this approach should give it to you in a pretty straightforward

opening post probably meant qt which definitely is a complete creator comes in two a simple one which is open source and is licensed only to create open source and a paying one which is licensed to create both oss and qt creator is just as portable between platforms as qt itself and uses the mingw compiler under ms windows and the gcc compiler under speaking i found open source qt a polished piece of software which gives a much smoother and more pleasant user experience than kdevelop tries so desperately to implement slews and slews of bells and whistles that it neglects to make simple things easy and and it has few features and a much simpler interface than kdevelop the paying version also has a more complicated the qt framework exclusively allows you to easily make applications that run under linux ms windows with no more than a and which look the same on both kde on the other hand is i especially liked is that importing about 35 files from a commandline app developed under having qmake set up the makefile and then compiling it worked like a as opposed to kdevelop where a big easy to have qt creator set up a commandline app now that the commandline version compiles i can easily make a qt gui to prepare the options set the pick and click all the input and set the output the only thing i have to change is to change my previous function into something let qt generate a main app for and then and call it in response to a i had such a hell of a time trying that with kde and kdevelop a year or so ago that i completely gave up and went back to you really really want to develop for kde only and are determined to use kde functionality that goes above and beyond i would choose qt

option would be to post the work onto a queue of some sort could use something enterprisey like with or as a connector or you could use something lightweight like which is written in scala and speaks the same protocl as memcache so you can just use the python memcache client to talk to you have the queueing mechanism set you can create as many or as few worker tasks that are subscribed to the queue and do the actual downloading work as you you can even have them live on other machines so they interfere with the speed of serving yourwebsite at when the workers are they post the results back to the database or another queue where the webserver can pick them you want to have to manage external worker processes then you could make the workers threads in the same python process that is running the but then obviously it will have greater potential to impact your web page serving

others have already pointed out when you do a select distinct over your end up with a full table scan no matter really a matter of limiting the number of rows that need to be question what do you need your distinct typenames and how many of your 200m rows are do you have only a handful few hundred at distinct so you could have a separate table or something and fill those initially by doing a full table and then on inserting new rows to the main just always check whether their typename is already in and if add have a small table with just the distinct typename which would be lightning fast to query to

our used scaleout stateserver commercial product to accomplish distributed caching replication of objects throughout a server farm for similar this has been quite although using objects does incur so in many cases we simplify what storing to just string values where fully evaluated the velocity since our usage started before that existed and we have time or compelling reasons to consider a switch at this but that obviously warrants some investigation if just starting i did indeed miss the important part about the question the flattening of object this may be things or have other but what if you took the approach of more closely simulating database storage in your distributed cache it to storing a single copy of each distinct object and using looser references to link those entities you have a which has a property and all containing objects that are instances of your have to use custom serialization to pull it and nothing will magically solve concurrency dirty update but the idea is that what put into the distributed cache would actually be all individual as well as a shallow copy of the instance that shallow copy would serialize the normal properties as well as unique identifiers for each reference contained within the original database a unique or whatever is rather than the person objects so have a instead of the and the members collection would serialize as a list of each person referenced is also stored as a separate where the concurrency trickiness comes into deserializing on depending on usage the group shallow copy would follow all person id references and those references with the real person objects stored separately in the distributed need to implement locking mechanisms to make sure updates to those which could be shared among many different were also need a versioning mechanism and a whenever necessary to up any changes to the person object made within the distributed does seem quite but the most generic approach i could think of without knowing the specifics of your use

parameters also avoid the problem where classes provide dozens of methods that are just variations on the arguments the exception instead of one constructor with optional it has four constructors for each combination of and inner but now consider what happens if you provide a null value to a constructor taking an does it act exactly like the constructor with with no innerexception sortof like the constructor with no innerexception or does it throw a null reference single constructor with 2 optional parameters would have made it more obvious that passing a null innerexception was equivalent to not including it at a perfect place for default forget that now every derived exception class also has to include 4 which is a pointless

part of a project working on in i need to read in a the first thing i want to do is to get the schema table from the i have code that works as long as the filename the is not longer than 8 say i have a file named the following code does not it throws the following microsoft jet database engine could not find the object make sure the object exists and that you spell its name and the path name cxn connection new get past this the next step is to use a name the olddbconnection likes instead of which leads to cxn connection new does successfully return an now to get the schema table i try the schematable new null returns a datatable with no if i rename the filename to 8 or less characters then this code works and i get back a row for each field in the the long i know the returned connection is valid because i can use it to fill a dataset like selectquery from command new dataadapter new dataset new gives me back a dataset containing a datatable with all of the data from the dbf the question is how can i get just the schema table for the long named dbf of course i can work around the issue by the but a hack i want to have to nor do i want to fill the dataset with the top 1 record and deduce the schema from to use getoledbschematable method on a long name dbf

party vendors using our software as a component view windows logo certification as an important selection of the requirements are easy to adhere to given the flexibility in deploying java some immediate difficulties present jar files with resource strings for versioning from properties files to path name long path name unc well support by the and feel requirements will require some serious recoding to i may be interpreting the specifications too i found one decent example of an application that obtained 2000 the look and feel in this instance only refers to any visible installer that we even the specifications themselves imply things in the descriptions that are not really covered in the title of the application should not read from or write to or your application uses information that you do not want to put in the create a private initialization file and place it in the directory with the executable you can easily manage the installation of private as well as add or remove information from existing by using windows installer to install your feedback would be windows logo certified applications harder to write in

paths in the database might be depending on your specific but consider storing the filenames in the database and construct your paths to those files in php in a single that if you end up moving all uploaded files there is only one place in your code you need to change path and you can avoid doing a large amount of data transformation on your field in the for the file you might store it can use a configuration file or if you a global somewhere to define the path where your uploads are stored web and then split characters from the filename the to figure out which subdirectory the file actually resides for displaying your you can simply load your list of files from the database and use a function to get download paths for each one based on their if you want to paginate the list of try using something like start limit in just pass in a new start number with each successive page of upload

performance breakdown seemed to be caused by the high number of blocks in the for every message received i was creating a adding that run to a paragraph and adding the paragraph to the changed the algorithm so now it creates a paragraph then adds 250 runs to that then creates a new paragraph adds 250 runs and so this essentially cuts the number of blocks in also has an added benefit when i reach the max number of lines instead of deleting a single line for each new line added pegging the i can just delete the oldest paragraph and that instantly deletes the oldest 250 relatively simple change brought the performance well within the acceptable instead of pegging the cpu and locking up the now the cpu stays relatively low with spikes around

perhaps the best real world example in consider the lists implemented in this where the list chaining aspect is backed directly into the type rather than as a separate can be extremely powerful and they come however with a variety of trade obvious one is code you must bake this logic in each techniques such as extending a base class providing the pointer are messy lose strong typing without and often unacceptable from a performance point of is that you are limited to one implementation per you cannot make a singly linked structure into a doubly linked one without inserting an extra field in every instance and updating all the relevant

pontus makes good the problem is that the presentation is actually the structure of the so there really a choice if you want to add new own application is quite rigid in this functionality is added through creating new command object that manipulate the you need to use the objects developed by using the memento pattern to save the initial state and then save the changed state so that is properly you have to put the command object in one of the event handling structures in the view that was developed using passive of course the choice of supporting object and functions within the command object our developers have a fair amount of you are talking about new applications that are made by a company then there is often a good reason while the various patterns are in our company we have to maintain our application over decades so design adaptability is very we use the flavor of the month in development as it will come back and haunt us 15 years so many of our application are designed using passive view and multiple layers connecting through well defined this served as well when ms decided to axe vb6 in favor of sometimes is just the manager following the flavor of the in this case you need to try to educate the manager as to why your proposed method will work out better for the company in the long otherwise then you need educate yourself as to why the company chose the standards it

pretty much tried every python web framework that and it took me a long time to realize there a silver bullet each had its own advantages and i started out with and heartily enjoyed being able to control almost everything at a lower level without much but then i discovered and i have been using it ever tools like catwalk and the web console are invaluable to with turbogears 2 coming out which brings wsgi and after reading up on the religious debates between the django and wsgi really torn between it the right learning spending valuable time writing functionality that already exists in django and other as opposed to using django or some framework that does everything for the downsides with the latter that i can see are pretty not learning anything in the i ever need to do anything lower level going to be a overhead required for just a basic site which uses authentication is i guess my question which is the better or is it just a matter of and should i suck it up and use django if it achieves what i want with minimal fuss want authentication and a crud interface to my i tried and but authkit and repoze scared me as well as the number of steps involved to just setup basic i looked at but the documentation seems and when referencing simple features like authentication or a crud various wiki pages and documentation seemed to contradict each with different hacks for versions and to lott for pointing out that i clear my question which of the following is worthwhile in the long but not painful in the short some sort of middle learn or stick with a if the i would appreciate a suggestion as to whether i should give django another stick with turbogears or venture into some other i have tried but seem to find a good enough crud application that i could plop in and use right vs other python web

probably cannot do that without hacking into the command inspects the meta object for each model to get a list of fields to which is created on class construction time via the metaclass of the base class construction is complete and your class has a if you you can check it out in the interactive the class construction is after the dedent following the the meta object is fixed affected by modifying the model and you will have to hack the meta is of course in order to add dynamic but since you are messing with internal objects it could render your app incompatible with future releases of remaining question why would you want to do since database tables are usually only created once when deploying your models are kind of	
probably do this unless the route is referenced in multiple i can see the value in doing and i have implemented htmlhelper extensions for adding style sheets and javascript includes to add the ability to use but my common links are included as actionlinks in a usercontrol and for most other things i use either actionlink or to reference the in some respects it feels like creating new methods for all but the most commonly reused links is adding complexity for very little value the kind of value that you would get from some simple manual testing of your which have to do

probably just stick with using a unless the minimal extra overhead a single extra word or pointer over your is really posing a nothing that says you have to a vector once been there are several the advantages of going with already handles assignment destruction properly if you roll your own you need to ensure you handle these the iterator support is there you have to roll your already knows how to use you really want to prevent the array from growing once you might want to consider having your own class that inherits from privately or has a member and only expose via methods that just thunk to the vector methods those bits of vector that you want clients to be able to that should help get you going quickly with pretty good assurance that leaks and what not are not if you do this and find that the small overhead of vector is not working for you can reimplement that class without the help of vector and your client code need to	
probably need an query to get this data if you use even with a sql query using select not getting the column can try using smo management a port to the or some other way to find the table then you build up the mapping using with a dynamic not sure if you can change the mappings after you already used the session worth a good luck

probleam is that when you are using you can use only subclasses as a snippet from a implements page that uses these field editors display and store the values on the instead creating swt controls to fill a subclass creates field editors display the of fields on the page must be as field means you have two options how to achieve what you your own subclass of which would represent the group not extend but only a than you have to implement method instead of you will also have to manage loading and saving of the but i think this way might be easier if you want to provide some complex may find some information more	
problem here is that i would like to pass an object to a derived but it must be done before the base class since the base class will immediately call the derived method that uses the an excerpt from the base from for abstract class public if public abstract bool public abstract void the derived class that myderived private string public myderived sampleobject public override bool return public override void doubt you can make execute a derived constructor before the base so really just looking for a solution to pass an object to the derived class before the object is gotten around this by putting the if block inside the there are other classes deriving from the base so i ended up having to repeat this block of code in every derived like to see an alternative to modifying the base a derived constructor before the base constructor in

problem here is that you really tell from the data where the entry is unless there is more detail as to how the old entries are i understand you are wrapping around at the end of the which means you must be deleting some of your old data to make however if the data deleted in a perfectly uniform end up with like hijkl nopqrs notice that there is no obvious next could be the last value but it might also be l or best you could look for the first or last missing element a stored procedure to perform a check just like you would to find a missing element in an integer but not going to provide any special result for

problem i see with doing this is at is what happens when you deploy a version which has new and changes close from to or when you have two actions on two different pages but they are both you want to make sure close is always even worse would be if the algorithim was based on something and could change over time without a just seems like you might spend more time trying to build an algorithim for something that should be decided upon at design	
problem i was working on recently got me to wishing that i could lop off the front of a kind of like a at if you truncating a file at the back end is a common we do without even thinking much about but lopping off the front of a sounds ridiculous at but only because been trained to think that but a lop operation could be useful in some simple example not the only or necessarily the best is a fifo adding new items to the end of the file and pulling items out of the file from the the file grows over time and a huge empty space at the with current file there are several ways around this each item is copy items up to replace the although it solution is very the size of the empty space and when it reaches size or percentage of file move everything truncate the this is efficient than the but still costs time are moved in the a circular queue in adding new items to the hole front of the file as items this can be quite if you mind of things getting out in the if you do the potential to move items but a circular queue is to implement and manages if there was a lop removing an item from the queue would be as easy as updating the as in as truncating a is there no such understand a bit about file systems and see any particular reason this would be it looks to me like all it would require is another word per allocation entry to say where the file starts within the with 1 terabyte drives under it seems like a pretty small price to pay for such other tasks would be made easier if you could lop off the front of a file as efficiently as you can truncate at the you think of any technical reason this function be added to a modern file file at

problem is related to how your ide tells the java compiler to interpret the source output might be another you run the javac program with no arguments you get a help print that hints you as to how it specify character encoding used by source thus interprets the source with its literal strings and turning it into utf8 i think in the byte sure the closure compiler has a similar the option to decide what encoding source files have is under general workspace text file under my swedish windows the selected default was care there since i avoid using characters outside ascii for exactly this

problem you are encountering is probably due to some dependency errors rather than anything wrong with the compiler are used by hundreds of thousands of developers and if a problem like this it would have been found by a simple project with the following two file c void print cout int dosomethingwithc main c dosomethingwithc file int dosomethingwithc you compile the above two files and link them you get any errors or when you run the find that dosomethingwithc clobbers even though its argument is your problem could be that one source file sees the class one way and another file sees it a different this can happen if the dependancy checking forcing a rebuild if that works then need to see why the dependcies have failed for can get it wrong

program is syntactically valid but it will produce undefined behaviour because you pass the address of a stack object to the heap typically this means that your program will crash when stack and the heap are two distinct areas of memory allocated to the process executing your the stack grows as you enter a function to hold its arguments and local and it shrinks automatically as you return from the the on the other is a separate address region where memory may be obtained on and must be released explicitly when it is no longer the address of a local variable is passed to it may attempt to free its memory and allocate it since the address is not from the and operates on the this will most likely will detect the address is not from the heap and abort the from the example program contains a few logical mystring declare a variable to hold a not a a string has type a pointer to the char is assigned the address zero which is conventionally assigned to invalid this compiles because the preprocessor replaces by the literal you store a zero byte in the which also by the terminator of a mentioned this is illegal because you pass the address of a stack object to the heap this problem remains in your second code you discard the return returns the address where the new memory was it may not be the same address as it may even be which is way of telling you it went out of is but the cast is is a more correct version of your allocate space one character terminator mystring some code using mystring omitted get more space mystring write to the string free the memory return it is better to avoid for you could use something like the some code using mystring mystring return

programming in using visual studio i often wish for code if like to achieve it by making my msbuild solution file call out to which would call ruby code for the code having the resulting generated files automatically appear in my one business example many possible examples i could where this kind of automatic code generation would be in a recent project i had an interface with some properties that contained dollar i wanted a second interface and a third interface that had the same properties as the first except they were with a business unit something like interface double totalrevenue double netprofit interface double consumertotalrevenue double consumernetprofit interface double corporatetotalrevenue double corporatenetprofit this there is a business and a business every property on iquarterlyresults becomes a property called on and likewise for make interfaces for rather than merely having an instance of iquarterlyresults for consumer and another instance for when working with the calculator object i was the user had to deal with of and it is much less confusing if he can deal with property names such as not get bogged down in this it is only an example and not the main main question is i love using ruby and erb for code and i love using rake to manage dependencies between to solve the problem what like to do is have msbuild call out to and have rake ruby read the list of properties on the interface and then generate the code to make all the dependent interfaces and their this would get triggered every time i do a because put it into the msbuild file for the anyone tried anything like how did it work out for what insights can you share about tips for have experience calling rake from msbuild for code gen and other how did it what are your thoughts	
programming language have a stack and one of the calls takes a to a memory within the they are free to move around the pointer passed and access it as they they offset the passed in pointer and passed it into a another function that tried to do this from an memory is of type and is bounds checked and indexes this causes a unaligned memory access points to on the even though we can peek into the we can not update the code so we notify the provider and they provide the update in the next want to understand if there is a work around for how do i perform the above assignment without violating the unaligned what is the best approach to resolving such is the workaround for unaligned memory access exception on arm9 using

purpose with typedef is to hide the implementation but the pointer property hides too much and makes the code harder to please do not do you want to hide implementation details often is a good thing to do not hide the pointer take for instance at the prototype for the standard char const char int file fopen returns a to some structure you do not know the implementation details maybe is not such a good example because in this case it could have worked with some pfile type that hid the fact that it is a char const char int pfile that would only work because you never mess around with the content that is pointed to the moment you typedef some pointer that you some places modify the code becomes very hard to read in my

question is a bit inserting data validating make you want to know how to insert well a basic mysql question which is probably best answered by consulting the you want to know how to validate the going to have to specify the kind of validation you sanders has sort of like asking do i make a there are infinite ways you can do the question is too you just want to check to see if the value submitted is a valid a quick and dirty way of doing it is just to insert it into the table you have a column of the then make a query to retrieve the value if the stored value is that data value or then the submitted value was not a valid your code would look something into values from where submitted date was there are many drawbacks to the above you probably want to validate the data you insert and if you are updating a record rather than inserting a new then you will need to fetch the original value before it is overwritten with an invalid i think you meant to say or a menu is something	
question is a follow up to my question about resources between web because i have not yet found a good have a web application with user controls and resources that are shared by three other web is what i know this can not compile commoncontrolswebapp into a single dll since i am creating user this is only possible with custom server where everything is in the so i need a way to share the ascx files between the four the files from commoncontrolswebapp into the three other projects does not update their files in the solution i would have to exting all in all three webapps when a file is added or renamed in to the web site model would remedy but i am worried about the compile time for if i do as does not work for could use subversion to share the files between the but i believe that this would require me to check the files in and out again all the time if i am developing a user control that i have to test through one of the it really be true that does not have a good solution for how are you guys organizing large web thanks a lot for all the i am going to copy my user controls with a build event for and then see if we have time to refactor them into server do i share user controls between web applications in

question is how does one abstract a database connection from the model layer of an the primary concern is to be able to easily change from different types of maybe you start with a flat then you want to move to a sql then later you decide an ldap implementation would be how can a person easily plan for something like a simple say you have a user with a first last and a very simple php class representing it might look like this ignore the problems with public instance user public public public have frequently seen where people have a dao class which has the sql embedded in it as userdao public public public public public function into user problem with strategies like this is when you want to change your you have to change every dao delete functions to deal with your new type of even if you have a program to them for you i am not particularly a fan you would have to edit this program to make it work are your suggestions for how to handle current idea is to create a super class for dao objects with its own load these functions would take arrays of the attributes of the dao and generate the query in this the only sql is in the superdao class rather than being scattered about several then if you wanted to change your database you would only have to change how the superdao class generates the foreseeable the the and the the best way to abstract the database from a php

reading your question it sounds like your ui collects the information and then uses the factory to create the appropriate we use a different approach in the application i startup my applications uses the factory method to create a master list of of my labels have initialization parameters because they are variants of each for example we have three type of flat part while others have parameters that are user defined or not known at the first case the initialization is handled within the factory so i create three instances of flatpartlabel passing in the needed the second case label interface has a configure this is called by the label printer dialog to populate a setup in your case this is where the tracking reference and customtext would be passed label interface also returns a unique id for each label if i had a specific command to deal with that type of label then i would traverse the list of labels in my application find which one matches the cast it to the specific type of and then configure we do this when user want to print one label only for a specific flat this means you can be arbitrary complex in the parameters your labels need and not burden your factory with unessential

reason for disliking properties is because they look like fields so developers who understand the difference will treat them as if assuming that be cheap to execute i disagree with him on this particular point i find properties make the client code much simpler to read than the equivalent method i agree that developers need to know that properties are basically methods in disguise but i think that educating developers about that is better than making code harder to read using having seen java code with several getters and setters being called in the same i know that the equivalent code would be a lot simpler to the law of demeter is all very well in but sometimes really is the right thing to automatically implemented properties really change any of is slightly like the arguments against using extension methods i can understand the but the practical benefit used outweighs the downside in my

reason they generate two different sql queries is that by tries to optimize your sql queries for fewer when you include a list of conditions as part of your find that require the use of other tables then of course the resulting sql has to include a but if all asking to do is to objects with relationships to the objects retrieving then rails figures more efficient to perform several fast queries rather than one big slow that this does not cause an because rails will try to load all of the associated records in a single	
reason this is occurring is because you are compiling each page individually becuase you are using a website instead of a web each page is an individual assembly that know about the if you want to use the gettype i would recommend changing to a web project to make your life

reason you cannot safely call on instance of is due to lack of the public property provides unrestricted access to part of the internal as this part of the internal state must obey the rules of the idisposable it is important to make sure that is well problem is similar to allowing access to an instance used for if you do it becomes much harder to determine where locks are you can avoid exposing your disposable instance the problem of who will handle the call to goes away as	
reason you need two functions is because a is fundamentally a different type than a no getting around pointers are only use them if you need the address of something rather than the reference to and rarely do you need the actual address of an do the the function into a using pointers where you certainly should avoid having pointers you might want to investigate	
reasons explain i would just treat the interesting event as being whether or not the or part of a has arrived to your a thread reading data from each as probably thread that does the message the client threads signal to the message collation thread the very first part of a new message when a message is complete from a client that it passes the actual message to the collation if your collation thread had the initial signal that the part of a message has just treat that as client ready to send a want to set a timeout on the sockets as another poster has although with this threading i think it really depends on what policy you want to other suggestion of asking the client is sort of but probably not the solution you really you open another channel to the client to ask you just sent some but if the client and you got then in general something has just gone wrong and not clear whether that knowledge will help you or it might say and then just at that moment send and will the other channel to the client if the client says sent how do you know whether just about to arrive or has and will never

reasons why i do not want to accept the connection in order to check the remote ip the client would see that there is a listening socket on this if i decide to reject the client i would not want them to know that there is a socket listening on this this technique is not as efficient and requires more and network so it is not good in case of a denial of service

recently coded up a virtual heap class for a high memory usage problem that i the code is and is hosted at it works as define a block size and number of blocks to leave in and a filename for caching to the in my usage case i have 200 blocks of 1mb in memory at any then call allocate to reserve a chunk of you are returned a 8byte to the you can allocate chunks larger than the block size if to write to the there is a write function where you pass the pointer to the data and size of the to read from the there is a read function where you pass the pointer to the destination and size of the data to code automatically handles swapping between what is in memory and what is stored on pretty simple	
recently come across quite understand a few of the points mentioned in the author mentions the small annoyance of vs but seems to argue that it is actually necessary the without ever offering a did i miss the section in function it seems the problems can be solved with replacing the allocations if going to the trouble to implement an entire arena for making an be much basically the same as an except that it knows which arena to deallocate from when use templates in to determine that foo a constructor which needs to be do something for destructors in of overloading the author tries to do a why not this instead less i i memory allocation in argue entire article seems to revolve around classes with and located in a memory management while that could be and i argue with pretty limited in we have placement new and allocators what problems be solved with these in case just and in ideal what would replace invent syntax as necessary what would be simply to help me understand these problems with

recently started to to learn irricht 3d i already went through all the tutorials and feeling ready to build a simple game upon so here is some have irricht a 3d engine that is based upon the scene graph model it knows how to load meshes textures and show them it provides me structured classes to handle input from the user it provide me easy way to build a it provide me easy ways to define camers lights fogs etc and provide me more convenient ways to do more naturally what the engine provide is a way to define the entities in the game and the relations between example if a ball hit the wall i want the wall to be broken into several ok this is my job to lay down an infrastructure that will represent the game so lets say i already did it and i have some data model that abstract objects and how they relate to each other am talking about logic relations and not spatial that handle all the logic and represents all entities in the here is my is the best way to connect my data model to the this is not a techincal question but rather a design points to keep in data model built upon it aware of is accessible through something in the data i want to build scene graph again but the appropriate data model is mainly a of of entities that with each other in am thinking about the mvc pattern but i would like to hear more opinions from anyone who has some experience with making is the best way to build a game upon an exisiting

recommend using a ruby library designed for browser if already using ruby for for one it gives you a much nicer interface to the dom elements on the and it makes clicking links like this of course you have easier methods for navigating the table as easy enough to automate this do table processing goes know your use but this approach has its advantages and for one it actually runs a browser so if this is something you need to frequently run quietly in the background in completely automated this may not be the best on the other if ok to launch a browser then you have to worry about all that postback and you can just click the link as if you were a	
recommend using a separate presentation model type in most aside from the issue of binding is but there are other ways around this i think that there are other reasons why using presentation model types is a good models allow create a view and a presentation model at the same get your user representative to give you feedback on the iterate until both solve the problem of mapping this back to the models remove dependencies that the model might allowing easier unit testing of models will have the same as the view so you have to write code in the view to deal with navigating into and the models be used in an action for an object graph which contains cycles cannot be serialized to

running this from multiple need to introduce some form of locking to prevent problems with synchronization of your you probably should also make sure that your queue is locked when enqueuing as well as dequeuing the thread processing your queue is going to do nothing but basic code is probably with the exception of handling the case where the queue is currently you probably should add something would give you a way to until your events fill your when you dequeue from your you be able to use a want to do something myobject do your will prevent collection modification problems if somebody adds to your and keep you from needing to lock the entire time your processing your i do agree with some that this is not always the most effective the queue is going to be largely and only have elements on make a custom class that wraps could have an event triggered when the made as soon as the queue receives the event could trigger a thread to process it and empty it as soon as it reached 0 it could have an event to stop the would be much more effective than waiting constantly if the state is empty most of the on the other the queue is full nearly and the processing thread will rarely keep use the approach above for

search procedure described on the wikipedia page you linked to can certainly be generalised to other distance provided you replace with the equivalent geometrical object for the given and test each hyperplane for crossings with this if you are using the manhattan distance instead the sum of the absolute values of all differences in vector your hypersphere would become a is easiest to visualise in 2d if your current nearest neighbour is at distance from the query point then any closer neighbour behind a different hyperplane must intersect a diamond shape that has width and height 2x and is centred on this might make the test more difficult to code or slower to however the general principle still	
searches for exact to customize the matching you can use the finds first element of the array that contains finds first element of the array that begins with to clarify and takes two the first of which is an array you want to work the latter is a representing the predicate to does not have any idea about what kind of element you it gives you the flexibility to specify you tell it by passing in a function that takes an array element and returns a boolean indicating whether you want it or essentially calls that function with every element of the array and returns the index of the first element for which that function returns of writing a whole function and passing it using we can easily use the equivalent as as return addressof course if we did we had to store somewhere accessible to that a lot of dirty a lambda expression reduces all these can verify this code prints sub dim as string end

seems to me like the three answers so far have completely missed the point of your or i asking why win32 delphi have something like the magical function that article talks a function given the name of a dll and the type information of an returns an object that implements that interface using the standalone functions exported from the seems to be all about calling code from a win32 not about importing functions from a requires that the dlls export a special function that the manager will call when it loads the and the function must return an instance of the so the dll must be written in delphi or the on the other works with any dll written in any you could use it on if you know why win32 delphi have such a maybe codegear see much demand for it since delphi and turbo pascal had already gone for so long without certainly possible to write a function that works like and i expect it would be any harder to write than the version must have unless libraries already provide most of the pieces and delphi just wraps them up into a function that looks like the several other overloaded versions of that delphi has had for would be a few steps to implementing that function in providing only a sketch of necessary because i have a running copy of delphi handy right ask and maybe find more need to make sure that type information for an interface at a the undecorated names of its would need to generate a function stub for each method in the interface and the stub would go something like assuming the calling convention is pop the return discard the and restore the return pop pop push jmp generated each it would fill in the actual function gotten from calling with the name of the corresponding interface the calling convention is easy to wrap like is a little is a pain in the it has all the stubs it would need to generate an that looks like it implements the given it have to be an actual at compile know the layout of the interface going to be asked to so having a class accomplish final step is to provide implementations of the and would be is where call when the reference count reached do much at except claim that it supports and the interface given to used to come with a sample program that demonstrated implementing an interface without any classes at it was all done with records and function pointers is all an interface ultimately after delphi also came with the corresponding code to do it with in part to show how much easier delphi can make i find the name of the demo program but sure still around

short answer start by becoming an active user of the it will make it long answer problem that open source projects want help most would be happy to have all of the help they can the problem is that most people who decide to help stick around just long enough to take some time away from the development then and never show up have been very active in a couple of open source projects in the and we ran into this all of the it was very easy to get people to want to but very hard to get them to actually put the effort required into the project in order to be i personally spent many hours trying to help out new prospective and nearly always ended up just watching them team will be much more responsive if you can prove that serious and it usually takes more than just showing up in a chat or on a mailing start by finding the right easy to find open source but more difficult to find the one the right fit for is the or the easy depending on your point of recommend starting with a project that you are familiar with and hopefully one if you find one interested try using the software in its current state before you even think about trying to join the development if you are a user of the more likely that be interested in contributing over the project will do two things it will familiarize you with how they are thinking about the this will often make it easier to understand the design of the but most help you understand the goals of the current also often easier to get the ear of a if you have specific questions to i personally am always very responsive to a intelligent this helps build a relationship with the current development become familiar with the team and the project and have some idea of try to fix one or two of the this is an easy way to show that you can be productive and and will be received fairly that the team will probably be much more receptive to helping you find longer term goals and tasks on which to had a couple of people who approached our projects more along these and all been very happy to help them try to figure out how to fit in and mesh with the team as the goal you want to just be a contributor in the long want to be part of the when you start feeling ownership over the and when it really gets

should work on the code snippet a little is creating a pointer of type class2 that is being passed to copyto tries to call a member function of the received pointer that has never been segmentation fault and the program if that did not kill the you are trying to from to which is just about doing if what you intend is casting the returned value from you must know that you cannot use on you must either change copyto signature to return class1 that you can later cast or use on the that either copy is a virtual function in class1 that is in fact executed in class2 and does create a class2 or the returned element will not be a but rather a name of the method copyto is confusing as it is not copying the argument but rather from the after all i still not know what you are asking where would you want to use stack you can pass an stack allocated element to a but returning a to an stack allocated element is again a segmentation the object will be destroyed when the function ends and the receiver will be left with a dangling if your question is more theoretical on whether you can use on a stack allocated you can that class2 inherits from class2 class1 c1 is a class1 reference to a class2 you update the post a comment in this answer so that i notice and can correct it

sieve of eratosthenes works fine as illustrative way to find but i would implement it a little bit the essence is that you have to check numbers which are multiples of already known instead of using an array to store this you can also create a list of all sequential primes up to the square root of the number you are and then it suffices to go through the list of primes to check for you think of this does what you do on the but in a more quickly hacked implementation of what i mean copied from the web public class sieve private readonly primes new private int public one could add more to speed things up a but one is public bool first check if we can compare against known if return if make sure that we got all primes up to the square of int maxfactor while bool isprime for primeindex primeindex int prime if prime isprime if now apply the sieve to the number to foreach prime in if prime return if return about 67ms on my slow test program static void stopwatch sw new sieve sieve new for i i

simple and somewhat inaccurate way to do this would be to decrease the granularity of your it might not even be depending on how accurate your y measurements say we have the following y we floor the x and y we y 5 5 5 we can average those values by the floored x and y to show that we have average signal strength in the rectangle to the as as 1 as 1 as as table by ideally want to group data points by distance from point to and this groups them by a maximum distance that varies from 1 and to flooring them into rectangular so less than but it may work well enough for especially if the is less than the error in your measurement of is not granular you can use x someweight to adjust it to the granularity you and of course you can use or to do the same whole point is to a bunch of nearby measurements to one and then take the average of the collapsed

since these higher level manage the memory for what you use data structures main reason for using a data structure is not about garbage but it is about storing data in a way that is efficient in some so what matters most is how you are organizing the which is exactly what the language automatically figure out for the high level language will come with several preloaded data structures should use these preloaded data structures when they are provided instead of making your but not all data structures are provided that you may structures organize the storage of memory in some way so that the algorithms that run on them can be implemented giving efficient most tasks you need to implement your own data but this depends fully on what you are can understand the need for and stacks but would you ever need use a binary tree in are a lot of examples for using a binary but not in common every day for example you may need to implement huffman data can be used to have the space savings and fast lookups of using a or you may need to store a lot of data with fast lookup by using a several data structures have specific uses and are optimized for different whether the language is modern or not and whether it has garbage collection or not change trend is that custom implemented data structures are coded and thought about a similar argument happens with common in more modern like linq you simply specify to you actually say how to

so many before writing a php script to do some image the script has earned womm on my but when i move it to my host an images above a certain filesize cannot be moved all operations to the to be certain not some latent the relevant just to be switch case my mystical powers of been able to determine that is not in the script halts completely when it gets to some is correlated to images under 1mb appear to be fine but images around 3mb no clue what the precise cutoff is not due to server returns in on 3mb significantly longer on images no processing of large the function call with to suppress errors has no this matches well with the fact that the script is not throwing an simply silently terminating upon this function i had to there may be some gd parameter that i know about have access that limits input file sizes on servers the config variable guess is due to the fact that it barfs and appear to do any actual loading of or computations on the thanks for the calls to indicate that php is updating the and variables this necessarily mean that these resources are being simply that they appear to be functioning as following some references from the i tried optimizing the jpeg in quality from 3mb to with no so not an image filesize i then tried reducing the number of pixels of the original 3888x2592 and the first successful size is 1400x2592 and 1402x both result in and errors indicating which make much sense unless the entire image being by reducing further to i can instantiate the 400x300 thumbnail image that actually looking at the call using to take care of that task fails silently in the same manner as to why this a little 1400 2592 gives nothing particularly but i have to imagine this is a limit on the number of pixels gd php will is silently terminating	
so the between returning a copy and returning the reference returning the reference may or may not be it depends on how is implemented by your compiler implementation others have pointed but even if you return the reference the assignment after the function call usually involves a as in name returning the reference may or may not cause problems if the users of your function know what they are storing the reference as reference and using it after the providing object goes out of scope then a you want it and use your object can internally store the string as and return a that there will be no copying of the object going and and always safe your users pull out the raw pointer with and do stuff with it after your object goes out of

solution you are proposing has too much i would suggest you store the data in at least buckets instead of hourly and the time zone be normalized to if a user requests hourly data for 1 2pm from utc you can fetch data for from your system and show if you store data in increments you service requests to users in time zones with n hour daily numbers you would need to aggregate 48 the slots to pick would be determined by the time gets interesting when you get to annual data because you end up having to aggregate to ease that computation i would suggest you get the annual data per utc time and the subtract aggregate data for the first for hours of the year and add aggregate data for the first hours of the next this will essentially shift the whole year by hours and the work is not that working from you can tweak the system turns out kathmandu is gmt so you would need to store the data in buckets instead of another easy improvement is around aggregating annual so you have to add buckets each time and without requiring one aggregate per aggregate the annual data from jan 02 dec since the maximum difference between any two countries is 23 this means that you can take the annual data 02 dec and add a few buckets before and after as for example for a utc timezone you would add all buckets on jan 01 after all buckets on dec and on jan 01 the following year up to 0500

some on a 3ghz powerpc on that a virtual function call costs 7 nanoseconds longer than a direct function not really worth worrying about the cost unless the function is something like a trivial in which anything other than inline is kind of a 7ns overhead on a function that inlines to is a 7ns overhead on a function that takes 500ms to execute is big cost of virtual functions really the lookup of a function pointer in the vtable usually just a single but that the indirect jump usually cannot be this can cause a large pipeline bubble as the processor cannot fetch any instructions until the indirect jump call through the function has retired and a new instruction pointer the cost of a virtual function call is much bigger than it might seem from looking at the but still only 7 not and others also raise the very good point that a virtual function call may cause an instruction cache if you jump to a code address that is not in cache then the whole program comes to a dead halt while the instructions are fetched from main this is a significant on about 650 cycles my this a problem specific to virtual functions because even a direct function call will cause a miss if you jump to instructions that in what matters is whether the function has been run before recently it more likely to be in and whether your architecture can predict static branches and fetch those instructions into cache ahead of my ppc does but maybe most recent hardware timings control for the influence of icache misses on execution since i was trying to examine the cpu pipeline in so they discount that

sort of depends on what the queries are being used how often they are and what the user expectation is for response the query is running slow over a small set of probably a problem with your your or your network connection between your web server and your database optimization of the query is probably your best first task to address if the queries are running or in an area of the system where you need a fast response you may want to look at optimizing the query a the query needs to run for that length of time and cannot be optimized but the data change very perhaps caching the result in the application would help improve response you have a small load of users who care about performance admins running a then you have to	
sort of depends on your if your using the membership providers there is a which can tell you how many logged in users there i believe there are also performance the notion of a logged in user is a user who did something within the last x minutes where x is could also use performance counters to track incoming requests if you want to get a sense of how much activity there so you know the sql asp membership providers implements this by recording an activity date on a field in the it when just queries it for all activity within x added a client side polling function which hits our server every 2 so while a user is sitting on the page i know they are there even if there is no this also let me force the user out of the provides a method deliver other system kind of

split the modules necessarily need to have the same dependencies as the others just necessary to do if you break things up you can have libraries without cyclic the issue with using multiple libraries is that by swig declares its runtime code and as a as problems passing objects from one module to you need to enable a shared version of the swig runtime the documentation web page documentation link is runtime functions are private each that the runtime functions are with linkage and are only to the wrapper functions in that the only problem this approach is that when more one swig module is used in the those modules often to share type this especially true for programs swig must collect and information about relationships that cross out that section in your downloaded documentation the swig runtime and give you details on how to enable this so that objects can be properly handled when passed from one module to the not worked with python but have done tcl

standard has designed iterators to feel and behave as much like pointers as since iterators are based on the only relevant thing is that the iterator type has the proper operators the result is that pointers will behave just like random access a possible implementation of is to just make it a for an array you have the useful and methods to find the valid iterator but the problem you always have with c style as has been mentioned in the comments and other you can implement those functions for arrays if the array is not dynamic and has not decayed into a but my basic point was that you have to be more careful than when using the standard

states too complex for a state but i think running into some problems by trying to make a few of the transitions be handled specially or some machines helpful unless you can label the states in a meaningful means you need to call it something useful like et of the state machine pattern assumes that you have a detached entity that understands the states and how to transition between you have a method like the in your for where it blows up if the state be the state machine should simply prevent transitions that the number of possible transitions is small and and it makes sense to label also recommend naming the transitions as this is probably especially useful if the transitions all do the same thing but in slightly different

store 2 collections like that in jpa with you would do exactly as you have no annotation hence a fk should be placed in for each of the if you actually do have somewhere xml then setting the names of the respective join tables for each would work too they have their own join having a shared join table between 2 collections is possible in datanucleus but not standard instead a vendor that maps to hibernate no but then this is jpa so should be consistent since thats the point of having a spec

strings are terminated by a character with the value zero this could be written like zero this work inside there is a special syntax used in string where the backslash works as an escape sequence and is followed by various such sequence is that simply means a character with the value you can write things like sequence uses a backslash followed by the letter and one or two hexadecimal to represent the character with the indicated using this you could write the zero byte as for the also support for such constants in base they use a backslash followed by the digit just as octal literal integer is thus a synonym for is sometimes useful when you need to construct a string containing or special control also a set of special such as for for and so

synchronized functions for the same marking a method is very similar to putting a block around the entire contents of the the reason i say is because i know offhand whether the compiler emits the same bytecode or but afaik the defined runtime effect is the deadlock is a classic locking one thread locks then simultaneously on a the other thread locks this part requires that the scheduling of the threads just so happens to interleave at the right thread whatever order or then attempts to acquire a lock which is already held by the other and hence each thread goes to neither will wake until the other releases its but neither will release its lock until it wakes is

that has helped me in the along with creation on demand as mghie was to use the call lockwindowupdate around the frame this call is global in nature but will reduce the initial flicker as the paint operations will not get invoked until after you relase the lock on the parent the general code template would look something like the your frame code goes running with the window it will not respond to paint also the function is so anything else that calls will break your when the lock is then the window is immediately which saves you from performing that call in as pointed out in the comments care should be taken when using the lockwindowupdate however i have used this method with great success in the past and still recommend if used what you want to do with this method is to call inside this or pop up a modal dialog or a showmessage call even populate from a just restrict the portion within the lock to what your if you play your users notice anything also used as a but in reality i generally only lock handle of the container that the frame is being placed could try the method mentioned in the article in the but this requires that the message loop is also processed and generally my calls to lockwindowupdate are extremely

the data that caching is required by more than one it sounds like from a service oriented architecture anyway that it belong in either of services you have calling the data being cached really related to either but is something that both services then perhaps it belongs in own seperate have you considered encapsulating your cache in a third and performing a call to retrieve the data you benefits solves your original avoiding the need to read the whole cache from the database several encapsulates the cache in one place for easy allows you to abstract the implementation of the cache away from the other services by putting another service interface in the in suggest the best the only downside is the extra overhead of making the but that surely outperforms having to read the whole cache from the if the data in your cache is very closely related to both of the services that are calling the both services the data in the then perhaps the two existing services should be combined into a single what saying is making some then then principle of soa drawing on is

the entity framework is really limited in terms of what kind of many to many relationships it can the only thing that the visual studio designer will recognize is a table consisting of only two both foreign keys to the other two and where the primary key is a compound key on both of the foreign if you have control of your database one thing you could do is change your table to drop the column and make the primary key a compound key on and if you do then when you map the tables the entity framework will recognize this as a many to many you do that you have control of the database then you will need to make sure that the only fields that you map in your edmx are the fields which relate to the other and that you do not map the primary this is because the mapping wizard will discard and the storage mapping every time you option would be to not use a many to many mapping in the entity framework and instead just treat the relationship as another entity instead of having it subsumed into the remember if this has been improved in the forthcoming

the first option would seem like a bad should that be it is rarely done this exceptions are from within a catch block usually under two conditions you want to check the exception generated for data and conditionally bubble it up the ex for certain if throw the exception here an unacceptable condition has occurred within a component and this information needs to be communicated to the calling code by appending some other useful information or wrapping it in another exception type up the exception to calling code wrapping it up in a custom throw new just	
the first portion recommend using the anchor property on usercontrol instead of trying to size this it works very and very for handling window you want to do you should probably look at chaining off instead of and probably setting your control too and unachoring the panel or other thing sitting which causes all sorts of second part is due to the fact that gridnamevalue is a member of a you call returning a size then trying to set the width on the returned struct the this is why you need to set the entire size valuetype in one creating a new and setting it to is the only way to make that

the following result1 result2 should always equal result2 the thing it result1 is and result2 is the only difference is the order of the know that doubles are implemented in such a way that rounding issues can aware that i can use decimals instead if i need absolute or that i can use in my if just a nerd who wants to understand what the compiler is can anyone tell to everyone so far suggested reading up on floating point arithmetic talked about the inherent inaccuracy of how the cpu handles but i feel the main thrust of my question is still which is my fault for not phrasing it let me put it like down the above i would expect the following operations to be r1 r2 r3 r4 assume that each of the above additions had a rounding error so r1 contains rounding error r2 includes rounding errors e1 r3 contains e3 and r4 contains e3 i know how exactly how the rounding errors happen but i would have expected to equal clearly it but that seems somehow wrong to another thing is that when i run the above i get any rounding what makes me think the compiler doing something weird rather than the know asking a lot and maybe the best answer anyone can give is to go and do a phd in cpu but i just thought at the il from my original code clear that the compiler not the cpu doing private hidebysig static void cil init float64 float64 nop ret compiler is adding up the numbers for does the order affect the rounding when adding multiple doubles in

the most applications with a safe type system just or allow the application to violate those overflows and many other exploits occur because the constraints in those languages and runtimes provide no checking and cannot guarantee the program do something like execute arbitrary code in safe systems verify the code to be free from those a side can still perform unsafe actions and set itself up to execute arbitrary just rather cumbersome and unlikely to be used in a real security holes you would see in a managed browser would be if it let arbitrary code be using the clr as a safe while the clr generated code the of your will be the loader and verifier themselves are usually written in a lower been a few think 2 for security holes where a maliciously formed assembly could force the actual clr to execute arbitrary these are relatively rare and the surface area is far less than be a fully managed browser itself fall prey to those specific but that also means have to have your plugins written and executed in a similar way there are other security holes that can be but usually they will be less severe than find with an unmanaged for would still remain an but at least you have a document can execute arbitary type

the speed is you would probably want to do it via some kind of socket usually signed applet or a webstart java application is able to open a listening flash application then would be able to connect to this socket and as a result you will have very fast bidirectional are some caveats should bear in mind that user might get suspicious about weird socket activity on his or it would be just blocked by a firewall so need to warn order to be able to connect from flash to you must dispatch crossdomain policy file from the listening socket any other below 1024 see documentation for also your flash application might need to request such file manually from the java of useful links on how to get certificate for your java to get free code signing certificate but less detailed description in if you are able the speed is to use applet javascript combination advice to take advantage of

there any a timeout executes a certain amount of time after is an interval executes a certain amount of time after the previous interval will notice the difference if your function takes a while to for if we represent a call to with a firing of the with and javascript code execution with the timelines look next complication is if an interval fires whilst javascript is already busy doing something as handling a previous in this the interval is and happens as soon as the previous handler finishes and returns control to the so for example for a process that is sometimes short and sometimes long represents an interval firing that execute its code straight and was made pending intervals try to to get back on they queue one on top of each there can only ever be one execution pending per they all queued the browser would be left with an list of outstanding x represents an interval firing that execute or be made so instead was your function habitually takes longer to execute than the interval that is set for the browser will eat cpu trying to service and may become less do you use and gives a guaranteed slot of free time to the interval tries to ensure the function it is running executes as close as possible to its scheduled at the expense of browser ui would consider an interval for animations i wanted to be as smooth as whilst chained timeouts are more polite for ongoing animations that would take place all the time whilst the page is for less demanding uses as a trivial updater firing every 30 seconds or you can safely use terms of browser settimeout predates but all browsers you will meet today support the last straggler for many years was ie mobile in winmo but hopefully that too is now behind	
there any advantage to using django instead of mvc other than i might not want to use windows and mean this as a religious type i honestly know of any reasons other than personal preference but want to confirm for i might have only microsoft products and be well versed in and desire to start a new project that uses i might have all servers and therefore want to use django apache on i might have both and simply want to choose the best for reason this context does it all boil down to personal preference based upon what you happen to have in your my personal reason is because i like os x and linux server and want a reason to use it and learn but not much of a business there any advantage to django versus mvc other than

there are limited strategies for automating memory allocation and deallocation in the compiler generates a lot of code behind the scenes for you it keeps track of each variable on the stack and makes sure that the appropriate destructor is called when the stack is cleaned this is actually a fairly sophisticated type of code especially when you throw exceptions into the on the other hand is much which is why sometimes called level assembly c have any mechanism to guarantee that a particular bit of code is called when a function exits or a variable is popped off the so up to you to keep track of each bit of memory you allocate and every file or network socket you open and clean them up at the appropriate no practical way to build an automatic smart pointer in concept you should look at is rather that try to keep track of every individual block of memory you you create a do some chunk of placing every memory block you allocate into the then free the whole pool when you trade off a little bit of performance and control here in order to ease the cognitive load on the but most of the time well worth should take a peek at the apache portable runtime they have a memory pool library at if apr is too much for you to dive you can implement a very simple memory pool using three functions and a linked list data pseudocode would be something pool struct pool pool allocate a pool and return it pool void create a new pool node and push it onto the list pool walk the free each memory block then free its node the pool is something like struct pool pool is empty pool full of clean it up and make a new one pool new pool is empty return

there are options to shorten the infowindow are correct that pixeloffset is not what you are looking it is the equivalent of setting the infowindowanchor offset resulting in the same length but pointing at a point offset from your so you can move the window using this approach long as you use not supported in but the tail pointing to something below your icon looks pretty hope i have missed something here and someone can correct it would be great if this feature was i feel like pixeloffset should do as you can already offset the infowindowanchor when you create the	
there are two reasons to instantiate a new object it and it from the first case is handled by the you can provide several methods to create an object on the methods should return valid so you can pass parameters to these methods to provides required factory method can also chose the actual type to instantiate based on should not mix this with rehydrating from the this kind of instantiation should take values from the datarow and instantiate the object with i usualy call this a instead of a main difference is that the factory will instantiate an object with a new identity while the databuilder will instantiate an object with an already existing

there but it is not easy and may not be worth your way of doing it is to create your own buildprovider and replace the default with it in the config would also create your own most likely inherited from the the buildprovider is responsible for supplying the in most primitive situation you could overwrite the parsefile read the aspx process create a copy and pass it to the base all aspx parsing code is sealed and internal to ms so you rewriting it would mean building entire compilation alternative method is to create your own page builder and put it in the the drawback is that you get an easy access to literals your spaces of the first level to get to inner controls and their you have to either hack the parser using reflection or manipulate the code this way you would get properly built files and temporary is a simplified public partial class is builder of the public class mypagebuilder is where strip white but only of top as between the head and or form and the end of public override void replace some white spaces with you can manipulate the entire generated code using public override void you can the pageparser here using the field at this point is so it be public override void controlbuilder type string string fieldinfo fi string s my it is not worth the

there is no cost to the do when writing the is just as easy to write as so prefer the there is no cost to the other going back and making this change takes and it most likely make a noticeable so you probably bother with it can make a on probably but for complex the compiler is unlikely to be able to optimize it the reason for this is that the increment operation no is no longer an intrinsic built into the but a function defined in the the compiler may be able to optimize it like any other but it can in assume that can be used instead of the two functions may do entirely different when determining which optimizations can be done by the consider whether it has enough information to perform in this the compiler know that and perform the same modifications to the so it can not assume that one can be replaced with the but you have this so you can safely perform the of the others you mention can usually be done very efficiently by the can be done by the and usually better at it than all it needs to know is how large a proportion of the function consists of function call over and how often is it a big function that is called often probably be because you end up copying a lot of resulting in a larger and more instruction cache inlining is always a and the compiler is better at weighing all the factors than unrolling is a purely mechanic and the compiler can do that same goes for strength swapping inner and outer loops is because the compiler has to prove that the changed order of traversal affect the which is difficult to do so here is an optimization you should do even in the simple ones that the compiler is able to you sometimes have information your compiler if you know that a function is going to be called extremely even if only called from one it may be worth checking whether the compiler automatically inlines and do it manually if you may know more about a loop than the compiler as well that the number of iterations will always be a multiple of so you can safely unroll it 4 the compiler may not have this so if it were to inline the it would have to insert an epilog to ensure that the last few iterations get performed such optimizations can still be if you actually need the and you have information that the compiler outperform the compiler on purely mechanical but you may be able to make assumptions that the compiler and is when able to optimize better than the

they produce the exact same result so they should be optimizable in pretty much the same there are more chances that the compiler will optimize the switch case with a jump table than the talking about the general case for 5 the average number of tests performed for the ifs should be less than assuming you order the conditions by hardly a bottleneck to write home about unless in a very tight

thilo but explain a little further webserver is this is really the problem of the you just log and then say now this user is logged you need some way to identify which user it is requesting a new site this common way of doing this is by implementing if you your network traffic while logging and then browsing a site commonly notice something like you will transmit your username and password to the completely https will encrypt this request for you to avoid you will receive a randomly generated string of a lot of weird these will typically be stored in a of some site only you should have access you will transmit the randomly generated string to the the server will look this string and see that associated with your this allows the server to identify and grant you access to your http in itself is not this means that your password and your randomly generated will be transmitted completely if someone has access to your traffic router he will be able to see your username password when you log if not using this will grant him access to your site untill you change your password he changes it first in the rest of the requests he will be able to get your session which means he could steal your identity for the rest of that cookie lifecycle you log or the session expires on the you want to feel use realistically a lot easier to social engineer a keylogger into your computer than it is to read all your traffic as others have pointed use to read your session	
thing i would do is check your employment you may not have touched the project from was a good move by the many employment contracts border on the draconian and they may own the rights to what you do in your free particularly in this case where what doing has commonality with your they may even argue that the backup solution is directly or indirectly a product of what you do for them so they have a claim to the rights a portion rights they do have and whether any employment contract terms are enforceable of contracts get pushed on employees that are basically is something you need to speak to a lawyer you want to take it that far get them to stipulate in written form email will that this was done in your own not as a product of your employment and that your demonstration is just any discussion about use of the product and licensing is deferred but you reserve the right to grant a license or you might not get all that but get as much of it as possible before the if there is someone sympathetic in management you can speak to just say that you touched this from work and just worried about maintaining control over your free time

thing that uuids buy you that is very difficult to do otherwise is to get a unique identifier having to consult or coordinate with a central the general problem of being able to get such a thing without some sort of managed infrastructure is the problem the uuids read that according to the birthday paradox the chance of a uuid collision occuring is once uuids have been now is a pretty big but a chance of collision seems far too risky how many uuids need to exist before a chance of collision even that seems like too large of a problem with that analysis is are not entirely random there are major components of the uuid that are time so to have any real chance at a the colliding uuids need tobe generated at the exact same time from different uuid say that while there is a reasonable chance that several might be generated at the same enough other gunk location info or random to make the likeyhood of a collision between this very small set of uuids nearly uuids only need to be unique among the set of other uuids that they might be compared if generating a uuid to use as a database it matter if somewhere else in an evil alternate universe that the same uuid is being used to identify a com just like cause no confusion if someone else named on

things leap out about the original batch neither is going to help in the long your benchmark be sure to capture the start time the and the end time the your sample do evaluates to something like and the command subtract you need a command that produces a simple scalar time was going to say it be but the batch language is a lot more powerful than it is given credit so here is a simple implementation of for the pax beat me to an answer showing the string splitting while i was fiddling and johannes suggested moving the arithmetic outside of the measured remeber start note that we look at the so calculation work right if the program run spans local do something but probably with more care about odd things will happen if any arguments contain precent signs or carets and there may be no way to prevent capture the end time before doing anything make t0 into a scaler in 100ths of a being careful not to let misinterpret 08 and 09 as starttime 360000 6000 100 make t into a scaler in 100ths of a endtime 360000 6000 100 runtime in 100ths is now just end runtime runtime started at ran for could simplify the arithmetic and be a little more honest about the overall accuracy of this by not bothering with the 100ths of a second here it is in assuming you have a sleep command or some other time timer sleep took 3000 ms to i revised the code and its description as suggested in a think that when the nt team replaced with they thought they get away with making it very but in it is almost an entirely new many of the old favorite commands have new features if the extensions are of those is which prevents variables from modifying the another is which gives you a remarkable amount of the principle trick used here is the new substring extraction syntax where means the two characters starting at offset 3 in the value of the variable named a real take a look at the full description of set at a and if that scare look at and notice that it can parse text out of fixed of time fields containing or reported by frankie in tweaked a couple of and added some that there is a glaring oversight here that probably not going to it work if the command starts on a different day than it that it will do some math related to the time of day and report a but the difference mean it to at least warn about this case is fixing it to do the right thing is fixed error where the is not set properly for single digit this is due to returning notice the using replaces the space with a leading zero and will be set this error only occurred when a script ran from one single digit hour to the	
think a algorithm would remove the possibility that the benchmark is biased through ignorance or to favor one it is very difficult to write a complex program in two different languages exactly the testing something like the efficiency of a multithreaded application in vs for would require developers skilled in multithreaded development both and there would still be questions as to whether the benchmark app properly represents the general or if it is misrepresenting a special case that only one language handles	
think a answer for really dependent upon the architecture chosen for your state if all the logic for changing state were encapsulated within your order then i would say it would be poor practice to expose a setstate since you have already placed some of the logic outside the order it seems appropriate to expose a public setstate or something your other choice would be to move the logic into the order based on what it seems as if that would create a very complex in patterns are really just there to help you architect your not to set hard and fast you should apply patterns to your architecture in the way that works not architect to	
think a bit of background missing long as using strings instead of the operators like will operate with unicode in python 3 uses unicode by making the distinction largely a string from to and then back to is suboptimal in many and many libraries will produce unicode output if you want so try to use only objects for strings internally whenever you

think a good idea to ask how much longer the expect to be using the if the lifespan is limited three years or then it may not make sense to put much effort into if the lifespan is expected to be then the payback for refactoring becomes that much more might also want to try creating a business case for the investment in show specific examples of the kinds of improvements that you would want to make an honest assessment of the and expected try to find a specific refactoring that you could implement independently of the and lobby for approval to make that change as a test run of the refactoring when you talk about you may be expected to provide specific not enough to say will be much easier to fix you should be prepared to say something like see a minimum improvement in turnaround time for bug or will experience fewer you should also be prepared to negotiate with management customers so that you all agree that you have measurements that are meaningful to and to provide measurements from before and after the

think about presumably you want to store of expression in a storing the whole you distinguish between an identical tree and a hash hashes map a larger set onto a smaller set is why a hash is so by have least the possibility you get an expression hash it and then go look up a result in your which leads to two a hash not in the one that you seen you have to let this one as you have a cached a hash in the but since you store the old expression tree that produced the hash in your no way to compare the newly passed expression to the old you may have a match or you may have a no way to distinguish between those two you return the cached because it might be a even if not a even if it is the exact same expression tree as the one you last how do we know that the backing object a a had elements added or deleted or modified such that the result returned by the expression might be different than the cached you can hash a tree leaf return return is some operation or more generally this is the same recursion we use to evaluate an expression we call	
think about the serialization at the end of the serialization you get data binary or and you should treat that as your plan is to securely transfer it over the you should look into but if you plan to transfer it over other means like email or file transfer or you need to securely store it or archive you should probably look into and related van den

think by the most fun and exciting platform to develop even though i am not a huge fan of its api is full featured and quite easy to appstore behind makes it the most compelling platform to work despite all the bad rep apple has for its unclear approvement documentation is very too old and almost unsupported by complete lack of good development documentation is very i like windows in my visual studio is the best ide you can use to and what you use when you develop for windows having said windows mobile really rocks for formbased but for general purpose is still behind documentation is very i like very but even though i like eclipse for java not that great for mobile its simulator is too i used it that much documentation is quite having behind is the most difficult but it has the biggest installed base so it be ignored by any tools that great and neither is java easy to use as long as you mess with protected api app will need special approvement from rim to use if you take into consideration java based i like android but installed based makes it difficult to ignore this only for low end

think in this case you do want to use because you want to close those disagree with the notion that you should have two try blocks in the same think the flaw in the design is acquiring the connection and performing the query in the same i would recommend separating the a service class or method knows about the unit of it should acquire the pass it to another class that performs the and closes the connection when that way the query method can throw any exception it encounters and leave the cleanup to the class or method responsible for the	
think is absolutely spot however like to add the following a meaningful error message is useful for logging and exception an exception thrown by the bcl is less likely to describe the specific circumstances of the exception wrt your perhaps this is less of an issue with null checks which of the necessarily give you much information was passed a null no idea is pretty much the best you can do most of the however sometimes you can provide more information and obviously this is more likely to be relevant when dealing with other exception null check clearly demonstrates to other developers and a form of you come back to the code a year that possible someone might pass a and it would be problematic if they did on excellent point you might do something before the null gets picked up i think it is vitally important to engage in checking for an exception before running other code is a form of defensive programming as you are taking into account things might not work the way you expected changes might be made in the future that you and ensuring that no matter what happens your null check such problems cannot a form of runtime that your parameter is not you can proceed on the assumption that it above assumption can result in slimmer you write the rest of your code knowing the parameter is not cutting down on extraneous subsequent null

think is quite but one thing to consider provides operators as template functions that accept two parameters of the same because most conversions arithmetic promotions and are not performed when template argument deduction this means that you would not be able to use any of these additional operators with such if you have a class that attempts to behave like a regular you might have written conversion or templated operators so that you can work because the two arguments are of different so template argument deduction will

think project constraints and the use of a standard tool are some of the biggest arguments for using creating an ssis package is most of the times way faster than trying to code something similar in with that it seems like ssis have a lot of that sometimes might invalidate this it did for me when developing a solution that needed to run in different environments at many different ssis simply looked too painful the more i evaluated it for the a properly architected solution is easier to more more easier to understand and can also achieve very good consider using ssis for projects that you only need to deploy to one or maybe two in house sql server the approach will quickly become more

think setting commits on a timed schedule is a particularly good especially if you start getting into testing and continuous committing at set intervals will break the build because there is no guarantee that you will have completed the changeset in the time better if you want to is to make the commit part of the build process just make the last step of the build process a commit to the that if the build you commit possible with all flavors of make and i know visual studio has pre and post build events that can be set to do something like so pretty sure that most modern ides can handle a special consideration for this problem in the commit hook to the beginning of the process so you can track when you mess up royally as well and how you come to fix the

think that best approach for you to take hen explaining this to your is by examples drawn from well known and succesful software and the way they approach major and minor first thing i would say is that the dot notation for releases is a relatively recent for most releases of unix actually had names sometimes included a meaningless rather than version assuming you want to use then the major number indicates a version that is basically incompatible with much that went consider the change from windows to most applications simply fit in with the new overlapped windows in windows for less a radical change in file formats could be a reason for a major version change wp graphic apps often work this other reason for a major version number change is that the user notices a once again this was true for the change from windows to and was responsible forv the latters if your app looks very a major for the minor version this is typically used to indicate a chanhe that actually is quite but that be noticeable to the for the differences internally between win and win were actually quite but the interface stayed the the third version well few people know hat it really means and fewer for in my everyday work i use the gnu compiler version how does this differ from i a

think that the separation of view from business is a velocity feature that is not present in you can do business logic in jsp or but not recommended at but i agree in your point regarding the is compiled to so i think that velocity is not done benchmarks of because closer to of creating reusable has lots of has no components itself component of open source 3rd have seen far more projects using jsp or jsp related technologies than maybe because velocity is really low are plenty of tools for especially the eclipse jboss suite has a good jsp for velocity are mostly not functional or pretty basic get lucky if you have syntax

think that there 3 main reasons why arrays are passed as pointers in c instead of by the first 2 are mentioned in other no size information for arrays in general you include dynamically allocated i think a third reason is due evolution of c from earlier languages like b and where arrays were actually implemented as a pointer to the array ritchie talks about the early evolution of c from languages like bcpl and b and in particular how arrays are implemented and how they were influenced by bcpl and b arrays and how and why they are different remaining very similar in expressions because array names decay into pointers in

think there are events called onrefresh or you can know when the page is but knowing why where the user is going is outside security the only way to know whether the page has been reloaded is to know where the user was on the last page which is also outside the scope of you can sometimes get that via but it relies on the security settings to permit access to that

think there is some truth in the after the first release or introducing new functionality and new bugs along with the bug fixes to previous so i think got a constant flow of new but after a while the code base becomes fragile and hard to and so i believe the flow of new bugs goes up when finally you can convince your bosses to stop patching and start	
think there might be something in the new dwm api windows which you write and install custom desktop with access to the same thumbnails you see in the flip3d and other	
think this depends on whether the framework genuinely solves a for and solves it people always find this a terribly controversial thing to say for some but most of the frameworks considered using ending up ditching halfway through because just easier to write some code to do exactly what i when i have a problem in my i can just go to where the problem is and add a line of code to fix rather than wading through pages of documentation to find the magic configuration if i have a problem with favourite i generally find around for ages when the underlying problem that the framework is supposed to be solving was never that complicated in the first favourite useless frameworks are ones that require lots of configuration and clumsy boilerplate code to do basic tasks such as sending some bytes down a socket or stuffing some parameters into a prepared statement and firing it off to a another of my favourites are the whole raft of especially ones that are or do i want a parser rather than just one parser that always call me victor but amazing how people can turn a regular expression problem into a that there are people who absolutely thrive on things with in them etc so clearly for some people in some a and just missing out in it depends on whether you or your organisation primarily have and things expertese or i suppose i have more of the	
think this is based on a if you have a look at the most projects if any open source projects follow the exact practices of xp or scrum but then the environment is	
think this is likely to teach you the program has to have a certain size before the differences between different programming paradigms really and people likely to write identical copies if the same program in different languages unless the program is examples would also be polluted with a lot of extra things that can be done within the standard library of one but requires libraries in and the programmer who wrote it may be more familiar with one language than so his implementation in some languages representative of how it be more likely to learn the difference between these paradigms the usual by learning what each and how to use	
think this is one of the biggest reasons that dvd and bluray were cracked so i think the only way that they could really stop the average person from being able to digitally copy home movies is if they created a medium that licensed for use on and could only be used on certified would cut out the part of the market that wanted to watch movies on their computers and but would probably stop from having perfect digital rips for a little and would stop the average person from being able to do	
think this is possible in pure it would be a security you could set up a that prints spam when i surf on might be some technique that allows you more access to the java flash or somethings but pure js would not do the job right know webstart can get access to your if you use signed jars and the client confirms and flash can access you webcam if you allow so i guess it may access your printer as	
think this is possible with conditional comment tags only work in internet it you just have to leave the content for browsers in a position such that part of a conditional comment clause but not actually inside a comment then browsers that know about conditional comments will see the content this is known as a conditional the markup microsoft give you there is invalid html not even to make it pass muster you just need a few additional this is this i have to echo in that rare you should need a completely separate for ie compared to other if doing something tricky like complex vml and activex work in ie with flash on other browsers i guess there could be a reason for but usually a few css and script hacks over the same basic page should	
think this is what you are looking mycondition it answered your you want to exit the method due to an error you can throw an exception like new error you want to return with a you should return like before with the value you it is the exception you need you can catch it with a try catch in the method calling your for 1 mycustomexception e put error handling int val val 1 throw new return inherits from the exception

think try using or session apparently can use which looks like it just write to a file and reads the vars i think better off using session variables	
think using design patterns in names is a for example in one of my games i second two classes and subclass gamelevelabstract and implement pure virtual i can see in my source view that that class is abstract and immediately know it is or what looking example is my graphics the same setup as i had except that it deals with find using the design pattern in the name to be useful and informative when i am looking for a i do believe that some things should not be used in the name such as however factory or facade are examples of design names i think fit well in the name of a class that implements those think that if you use good class names that help the programmer get a good grasp of what your class does at a glance is a good think that stating something is a data structure or an algorithm is a good thing in most or add anything to the understanding of the class as is obvious in

think what really looking for is a microsoft have their own product called internet security acceleration but you could probably find a source offering that will handle your fairly simple i kind of agree with and fail to see why you need to do	
think what you are doing is quite such little things as changes in displaying could and should be undertaken by example i have a main menu rendered by a separate there are lots of such little checks inside in order to decide what text to show and which styles to apply to list there are big decisions like thinking of what view to render based on some user action then the controller questions the business logic and decides what view to return of where to but if it is a quite stable ui element where only text and color options are slightly changed then put the necessary logic into could also pass a separate model to your ascx with several flags defining what and how should be then the actual logic to set those flags will be somewhere else on the business logic level and all your view will do is just look at those flags and render doing it	
think what you are looking for you are using a similar structure definition like jaredpar is something like t new buffer new pin stuff with your new tpacket	
think what you are trying to do is better served by using and separate as you want to add functionality to the base are only used to add resources or extra classes to the base	
think what you have to do is find the linker input property page for your project and tell it to specifically ignore and then explicitly link to the version you want not sure what will happen if they have the same	
think what you may be looking for are and a masterpage allows you to define a basic template that is by the implementing pages by having the implementing page add own content to the contentplaceholders defined on the a usercontrol is a piece of markup and associated code that you can reference from your mark up or add dynamically to the page being rendered in	
think what you mean to ask does and casting work for and are asking about implicit casting which automatically coverts one object to another defined you will not be able to do this for an and because they are already defined in the framework and you are not able to reduce the scope of the by casting it to an but if you were using that as an example for actual objects that you created you can use the link to learn more about how this works and how to implement you can always use the convert method to convert them to the right int myproperty	
think what you need to come up with here is a your integer array of writing the ints directly to the i would the array by turning it into a string the string might what would be sent over the on the receiving split the string by the commas and build the array back is more is human and means people have to think about byte orders and other silly you were working in or probably encode it in like	
think why not as long as you keep the usual crt memory boundaries if you allocate memory inside a library always free it from inside the library by calling a function in the lib to do the approach works fine for dlls compiled with all kinds of statically linked libs should be ok	
think works on lists as it requires a random access iterator which is not provided by a note that provides a method but completely separate from choice of container does relies on iterators to abstract away the way a container stores it just uses the iterators you provide to move elements the faster those iterators work in terms of accessing and assigning an the faster the would

think you are looking for lets you change the actual rules with ive used it a few years ago it seemed to have	
think you are misunderstanding something about the way that arrays of primitives when you create the array abcd it does not contain the variables and it should contain copies of their when you sort you do not actually have any impact on or way to accomplish something close to what you are trying to do would be to use a sorted where each value would map into a value you can then iterate over the keys a sorted and assign a sequential number to each value you clarify more about what really trying to it may be easier to

think you may be thinking of cas in the wrong i just may have not come across this but from my cas something that going to use in your application to protect the application against cas is in place to protect the users system against malicious whether you like it or must request permission to perform certain tasks on the an example of this is the before reading or writing a the application has to ask if it can even do of this is just one example of many permissions in the applications that see are most affected by cas are those that are hosted online in some and are therefore less trustworthy than those hosted on your local this includes internet explorer hosted objects are a lot like and loaded from a network i this is to protect a users system from potentially malicious you have missed any opportunities this system provides while writing native in if like be cursing this system when it bites you in the that no this kind of security necessarily more important for managed in it would be from a stand point if unmanaged apps had to go through this sort of security i think what microsoft was trying to do with for what

think you probably made a poor naming i would think would be a subclass of not the other way so use as the you upcast an to a your reference will only be able to access methods declared in if you downcast it back to an have access to all of the since java objects know what type they really anything that actually is an can always be cast back to no matter what type of reference you are using an there is unavoidable and part of the you could hide it behind some sort of but in your case that probably defeats the in all methods are virtual by this means that if overrides some method declared in then the version will be even if you access it through a if you need to invoke the parent class you can make a call by calling you probably use this very often least of the reasons being that it breaks

think your best option is to use the built in localization resources of the you can read more about the mechanics of that for using a database to store your localised elements images and the this is certainly a common but i think mostely because developers understand getting data from a more than working with satellite assemblies and the there a number of problems with using a so name only a added complexity of deployment of the application addtional load on the database where do you store the localized messages to say that the database is down some sort of text file also carries with it some deployment but more importanly the percieved flexibility of making text changes the is somewhat over apart of spelling mistakes and awkward wording almost always be shipping a new build as the text of your app

think your understanding is pretty much if you ignore the values and just look at the then for every node in the first tree there must be a corresponding node in the other tree and vice both trees would have the same number of you could write a algorithm to confirm this isomorphism by attempting all possible mapping and ensuring that for every node in the first tree that gets mapped to a node in the the corresponding mapping happens with the parent and with the two are obviously efficient algorithms to check for may benefit from reading about trees are a special easier to case since they do not have

thinking of where you bind a function and arguments together to be called usually currying is used so that you can add additional arguments at the time the function is actually than the a link to an the case mocked up in the question really is that you can pass a list of args as positional or a list of kwargs as named to another return return

this actually a strange as it might of the type of a constructor instance method field m of a type c that is not inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces is erasure of its type in the declaration corresponding to type of a static member of a raw c is the same as its type in generic declaration corresponding even though the type signature use any type parameters of the class type erasure kicks in and the signature becomes effectively map other i think you can imagine a raw type as being the same api as the generic type but with all bits removed from the not the this unchecked new map unchecked s2 because an implicit but unchecked conversion from the raw type to you can get the same effect by making an explicit conversion does nothing at execution in the last but with an unchecked x

this is a project that will actually be with the potential to have features added over go for a database solution from the even if it seems been down this road small features get added over and before you realize it you have implemented a bite the bullet and use a this is a learning it depends on the amount of data you want to if it is the easiest thing to do is read the entire file into memory and operate on it when changes are write the entire file back out to if the data is too large to do the next best thing is to have fixed sized create a pod struct that contains all of the data no stl then you can rewrite individual records without needed to rewrite the entire if neither of these will your best bet is a database

this kind of question i think you have to be very specific about what you are looking as there are many ways of interpreting it and many different some approaches are going to be too big a hammer if your question does not warrant the simplest there is the table data exactly the same or which you might attempt to answer with a simple count comparison before moving on to anything more the other end of the scale there is me the rows from each table for which there is not an equivalent row in the other or me where rows have the same identifying key but different data you actually want to sync table a with table b then that might be relatively using a merge

this problem is fairly confusingly compared to the usually much more clear style of the it looks like you might be misquoting the problem if getting the problem set from that could be contributing to your break the definition down for with some examples that might help you figure out going application of an expression e is an expression of the form e1 an example of an 1 this is an application of this is an application of includes the case corresponding to an expression this is an application of curried application of e is either an application of e or an application of a curried application of is the one that you above is the definition from the problem set that i found are two halves to this starting with the curried application of e is either an application of 1 a curried application of since it is an application of a curried application of since it is an application of a curried application of since it is an application of an application of a curried application of 1 a curried application of since it is an application of a curried application of since it is an application of 1 a curried application of since it is an application of 1 a curried application of since it is an application of a curried application of since it is an application of that give you the help you need to get is a curried application of it is that this is not a very good since in many implementations actually get or something like not possible to have a value that will return exactly unless your scheme has some sort of representation of exact second example is indeed an returns an which is not valid to it is only some of the later examples for which the recursive of an application of an application of the are take a look at for i just checked in and it looks like the concepts here explained until section while this assignment only mentions section i would recommend trying to read through section if you

this question is a dupe say because this specific question was not asked there a way to a to a csv prior to excel that allows excel to understand the correct formatting of the csv file requiring of the csv file and without requiring intervention in order to correctly format the fields by i mean any method whatsoever of generating a definition that can be saved somewhere on customer machine and then referenced whenever the usual csv import has to take including but not limited to or whatever conventions excel has for this kind of operation has a habit of being by modifying input data when opened from such as a csv an example of what is meant by see any of the various following regularly have to send csv files to customer x and we do not have the luxury of modifying the csv files directly in order to them into a format that excel will render exactly as customer x does not always have the personnel who are trained with excel in order to do the import excel to stop applying to csv import

throw any exception that is automatically thrown by the clr due to user for instance reason being is to do so creates confusion for people calling your users should be able to distinguish between actively thrown exceptions by an api and exceptions that are not actively thrown by reason is that at actively thrown exception generally represents a known state in an if i call an api and it throwns an i have a reasonable expectation that the given object is in a good it recognized a potentially bad situation and actively accounted for on the other hand if it throwns a that is an indication that the api encountered an unknown error and is now in an unreliable lesser reason is that these exceptions behave differently when thrown by user code as opposed to the for instance possible to catch a stackoverflowexception if thrown by user but not if thrown by the responding to also should not throw applicationexception or systemexception these exceptions types are too general to provide meaningful information to the code which calls your true you can put a very descriptive message into the message but not straight forward or maintainable to catch an exception based on a much better to catch it based on the rule on this

trying to figure out the best way to save and later open a tree my structure is made up of various object types with different but each inherits from a base abstract node has unique id and has an method that will set the parent of a this in turn calls other methods that allow the parent node to know what sub nodes it some nodes also utilize a method that adds a secondary parent to the was using binary but now i think i want to use something where i have a bit more and the serialized data is more i also want to retain type information when i and be able to serialize private so seemed like the best way to just serialize the root directly because of nodes having multiple i do not want to create duplicate so it would seem that i need to deconstruct the tree into a flat and then serialize then after serializing that list reconstruct the does this sound i said before each has a unique guid but right now nodes reference their directly and do not store their i could update the and methods to also update a list of parent ids to be serialized in addition to the direct but rather only this list when the object is being so i was thinking create an method in the node that would be called right before following is what planning to do for serialization and deserialization of this can anyone suggestion a efficient way to do provide the root node of the tree break down tree structure into a flat where is the of call for each node to update the ids it has saved for its serialize the of nodes with deserialize the of itterate through each in the reconnecting each to their for any parent ids stored find the respective in the with matching call the or to the node to its from any in the dictionary find the root of the return the root derialization of a tree

trying to implement something like google suggest on a web site i am building and am curious how to go about doing in on a very large data sure if got 1000 items you cache the items and just loop through but how do you go about it when you have a million suppose that the items are not one i have been really impressed by for if you search for it brings back but it also brings back toad the wet and their autocomplete is my first idea was to group the items by the first two so you would have something the key is the first two but what if i want to do something similar to pandora and allow the user to see results that match the middle of the with my wet would never match toad the wet sprocket because it would be in the bucket instead of the so then perhaps you split the string up and the wet go in the and buckets out the word but when talking about a million entries which may have say a few words each that seems like quickly start using up a lot of ok that was a long to implement autocomplete on a massive

two databases is very complicated if both databases need to be if one is a slave of the not nearly as i have more than once programmed just this kind of synchronization using once with an mdb on a web server that had to be synched with a local data mdb incorporate data edited on the no edits went back to the so but still the need to merge edits on the as well as once programming a synch between mysql on a website and access in a master slave the you program a dump of data for each table to a text helpful to have timestamp fields in the mysql tables so that you know when records were created and this allows you to select which records to dump since the last data dump makes the synchronization of data on the access side much way i programmed it was to then import the text files into staging tables that were indexed appropriately and linked to the access once the data dumps are imported into the staging you then have three the new records and append them to the access data this is easily done with an outer with the discuss this as with updated for i wrote dao code that would write sql like the where clause has to be a bit more complicated than that have to deal with and you have to use criteria formatted appropriately for the data with and for text and and no delimiters for numeric but writing the code to do that is pretty code looks something like dim db as dim rsfields as dim fld as dim strsql as set rsfields top 1 field3 from for each fld in your sql statement and execute next set fld set rsfields set db as i the complicated part is writing the where clause for each sql but pretty easy to figure note that in your rsfields recordset is used only to walk through the fields you want to you want to include only the fields that are so leave out the created field and the pk field any other fields that you want to for the might think a good idea to simply delete any record in the local table not in the remote that works fine if it really is a slave but so often what is originally a slave ends up getting its own in that you need to delete records from the master mysql and instead have a delete flag that marks records you could have different varieties of logic that could clean the deleted records out of the master database if using date stamps in the you could delete all records flagged deleted with lastupdated timestamp that is the last time you dumped the you could have the access app send a text file up to the server with a list of the records that have been successfully deleted from the access data if there are edits in the access data then need some logic for dealing with an edit there on a record that was deleted from the mysql you have a true fairly if you really wanted to do it by brute just dump the entirety of all the mysql data tables to text delete all the records in your access data store and import the text would tend not to do as the first time you need to depart from the pure hosed and have to rewrite everything from outline i gave above will work very cleanly for but will also work well if you have a few fields that are private to the or data that exists in the slave and not in the master is the situation i was working

two solutions are essentially implementations of the same root design pattern pattern as defined by the gang of in the former you are making the arraylist itself in the latter you are making the domain object which uses the array list tendency would be to do the make the domain object this is primarily because you may eventually have other things that could change about the domain object which the gui should be if it is already already that you strictly have to extend you can implement the design pattern without doing

typically implement the first it seems to be what the design guidelines the reason immediately but i consider it a good one any implementer of the class should have the same sort of protection against the case where the object is disposed as general in other best not to that whoever is implementing a derived class knows precisely when they can call a certain whose successful execution may or may not depend on whether the object has already been disposed or not ideally this should be documented via xml comments your second i would again stick with the recommended practice of passing especially since used in the core even if you think alternative methods are more i think best to stick to the method used in the framework for the sake of as with all clearly up to you how you want to implement a certain design though unless you have a particularly good reason highly advisable just to stick with in both these it probably do a great deal of harm to utilise some of the alternatives you suggested in your so long as they are used consistently and preferably documented to the

understand iterators we first need to understand are specialist objects which provide one with the means to move through an ordered list of items one at a time same kind of thing is sometimes called a the framework provides two important interfaces relating to ienumerator and objects which implement ienumerator are themselves they support the following property which points to a position on the method which moves the current item one along the method which moves the current item to its initial position is before the first the other implement the introduced the which is when the object either directly or the compiler returns the be combined ingredient of block is the yield there is one big difference between do not implement the reset the reset method on point of iterators is to allow the easy implementation of where a method needs to return either an enumerator or an enumerable class for an ordered list of it is written so as to return each item in its correct order using the

understand that this is a very broad but a short kind of answer will not be strategies are born to deal with broad issues should an application designer take into consideration when devising the error and exception handling the strategy will differ depending on the software type business hosted web embedded is the software type political and legal perspectives on error handling business ideas that i would have error reporting routes automatic admin in and robustness contingency and recovery against problems that are not yet users and customers fairly minimising the impact on software users and other people serviced by looking for a similar list of ideas and do use comments to point me out if i need to clarify the question further and thanks to everyone platform will definitely have some affect on the resulting implementation detail of the strategy from a developer perspective but less so from point of it is certainly most legacy systems i was asked to work on did not have a clear error handling this be made a community it seems as a good question and good questions are hard to come up do you mean by the a long term plan that gives brings consistency and coordination to error and exception in case of a larger team working on software the strategy can be formilised and distributed in a written seems to be duplicate question practices for exception management in java or and and why do you prefer exceptions or return these questions deal with a certain perspective on error handling like to learn more about other perspectives and how they contribute to the overall should be included in the error and exception handling

use of technical language can both help and hinder project depending on necessary to point out that what is considered purely on is as much of a technical as corba and something that sounds as jargon nonsense to one person is actually a shortcut to communicate a complex concept for development as a rule is activity involving in addition to the software knowledge one or more technical user it is a big mistake to assume that management and banking to name a few fields often incorrectly considered developed and advanced their own complex body of in other word sales marketing management technology and banking project responsibility to facilitate productive communication between representatives of different technical some handy a project dictionary that can be accessed and updated by everyone that common denominator language used for documentation functional domain specific terms only when but then always provide a brief explanation of the meaning from the wealth of online encyclopaedias by linking where sure that there is common understanding amongst the project team of the key that what is considered depends purely on perspective and you need to facilitate communication in all not just is often from software developers to business the end the software will have to work in the realm of users and you have to make a judgement on how much the ui will rely on specific domain language is going to be a trade off between and

view has always been that the appropriate way to handle this depends on the target audience and how your class is going to be the caller of your is going to realize that they are calling into win32 in one form or i would use option you have this seems the most to if this is the name your class in a manner that makes it clear that the win32 api is going to be used that being there are exceptions in the bcl that actually subclass win32exception to be more instead of just wrapping for socketexception derives from never personally used that but it does seem like a potentially clean way to handle the caller of your class is going to have no idea that calling into the win32 api i would handle the and use a more descriptive exception you for if using your and no indication that using the win32 api using it internally for some i would have no reason to suspect that i may need to handle a you could always document but it seems more reasonable to me to trap it and give an exception that would have more meaning in your specific business in this i might wrap the initial win32exception as an inner exception your case but depending on what caused the internal i might there are many times when a win32exception would be thrown from a native but there are other exceptions in the bcl that are more this is the case when calling into a native api that but there are similar functions that are wrapped in the in that i would probably trap the make sure that it is what but then throw the bcl exception in its a good example of this would be to use securityexception instead of throwing a i would avoid option 2 and 3 you two throws a general exception type i would pretty much recommend avoiding that it seems unreasonable to wrap a specific exception into a more generalized three seems redundant really no advantage over option

was a book i read last year by steve sanderson that briefed me on ddd even though the book was on mvc as a he really focused on the in mvc as a true and pure domain model using almost the book on modeling approaches i very much one thing he approached was using value objects in the context of aggregate roots he also showed how to use linq to represent the as well as the value point he noted the limitation of linq that it must have an identity on every including value he acknowledged it broke the pure domain model it was the only way to get it to work with was to give your value object an make that identity internal so it is not exposed outside of your this will allow you to link and share your objects using linq in your while not exposing it to the client layers it is as though they are value objects entity framework i believe suffers from the same example is class isdbgenerated autosync public int entityid public string insert business rules if need class make your identity isdbgenerated autosync internal int valueobjectid everything else public string myproperty

was testing out some synchronization constructs and i noticed something that confused when i was enumerating through a collection while writing to it at the same it threw an exception was but when i looped through the collection using a for it did can someone explain i thought that a list does not allow a reader and writer to operate at the same i would have expected looping through the collection to exhibit the same behavior as using an this is a purely academic i undersand that enumerating a list is bad if it is being written to at the same i also understand that i need a synchronization my question again was about why operation one throws an exception as expected but the other does is class private static new static void public static void for i i public static void this will not throw an i i this will throw an enumerator while string value does enumerating through a collection throw an exception but looping through its items does

was wondering how i should go about writing an xml data layer for a fairly simple php web the reasons for this server is not data schema that can be expressed in like the idea of having a self contained without server would possibly want to abstract it to a small framework for reuse in other schema resembles a simple book catalog with a few lookup tables plus it is quite simple to size of the main xml file is in the range of 100kb to but it could grow at some point to am actually considering extending my model classes to handle xml i fetch data with a combination of xmlreader and like function new xpath returns an return instead of loading the whole xml file in i create a simplexml object for each section and run an xpath query on that the function returns an array of simplexml for conservative search i would probably break on first found questions i have to ask you consider this as a viable even for a medium to large data there any to keep in when handling xml in the above code scale for large files inserts and updates in large xml files be handled in a low overhead you suggest an alternative data format as a better as a data layer for a php

way dunit normally works is you write some published and dunit runs them as what i want to do is a little i want to create tests at run time based on trying to test a particular module that processes input files to creates output i have a set of test input files with corresponding known good output the idea is to dynamically create one for each input that process the inputs and check the outputs against the known good actual source of data here however the difficulty is making dunit behave in a for the sake of this suppose that the data source were just a random number here is an example concrete problem that gets to the heart of the some test objects or at say 10 of where each named at run time from a randomly generated i mean the name of the test that appears in the or fails based on a random pass for fail for the design of it like it was designed with enough flexibility in mind to make such things not sure that it is i tried to create my own test class by inheriting from tabstracttest and but some crucial methods i also tried inheriting from but that class is closely tied to the idea of running published methods the tests are named after the so i just have a single one because then all my tests would be called and i want all my tests to be individually is there some alternative to dunit that could do what i dunit

way selector engine works is by utilizing existing javascript no one has created something like this in haskell to my and probably with good easy to do with javascript because of the dom and existing but in you have neither a big need for it nor is it particularly far as writing it just be doing a lot of nasty xml if you can tidy up the page into you can parse it as you can select based on if a node has if a node has a given what the element itself and so just looking for an xml library if this works for recommend only used it twice but liked nothing quite like this

way to think of a hash is like a human fingerprint are also sometimes referred to as can any person in to a unique you cannot know who someone is by their fingerprint this is just like a you can easily work out but given only you cannot trivially tell the source reverse a finger you need to compare the fingerprint to a database of known the unknown fingerprint matches the unknown fingerprint belongs to a again you must do much the same thing you have a database with all mappings a then you lookup the row with the hash and it shows was hashed in order to get the other more common way is to simply try every combination of hash them and compare force while human fingerprints are possible to have two the just incredibly unlikely the same with some hashing algorithms are more susceptible to than question is if the hashes are all i be able to compress anything into a 40 char hashing is a great compression but to decompress is incredibly impractical beyond 10 ascii characters of you can compress anything to a 40 character but you cannot decompress it practically theoretically is a bit of a	
way to try at way to do screen scraping in a much more structured way is to use or yahoo query it will return the scraped data structured as json or scrap from html where give you a json chose like this overflow works best with javascript beauty of this is that you can do and clauses which ultimately gets you the scraped data structured and the what you need less bandwidth over the wire from html where get you is any windows simulator available to test iphone as a hobbyist who cannot afford a i set up a toolchain kit locally on cygwin to compile objecti simulator port for windows have a button control need another web page to be redirected while clicking that button how to do that thanks to redirect the web page in flex application to get only the questions we do a title from html where the in projections want the function to be entered simultaneously by multiple neither do i want it to be entered again when it has not returned is there any approach to achieve certain doing something really obviously but been trying to figure it out for a few hours now and nothing is jumping out at using a modelform so i can i am going through my project in ie only its showing errors a runtime error has occurred do you wish to line 768 is this is regarding any script er have a java batch file consisting of 4 execution steps written for analyzing any java in one of the adding few libs in classpath that are needed for my co you write your query it generates a url for you our ultimately you end up doing something like this titlelist play with

we generate classes in by returning all the sprocs from all of our databases and adding the correct parameter types and names to a object and then returning it in one giant this means we can do things like when we want to pass parameters to a for a stored procedure without having to add the parameters with their relative data types every single time we make a it also means that we have to look up the exposed parameters for each sproc because they are merely put it into for every parameter you want to deal with in a sproc have to do this is undesirable as mean an application would explode into gazillions of lines of code to achieve really quite simple looking into refactoring this in such a way where we can do something like instead by making it strongly unfortunately this means our folder will be twice the size it already is because such a large quantity of code would be written a short example of what i class dim cmd as public sub uses the configurationmanager to get the connection string for a certain dim cmd as new end public sub param as end public sub param as end public sub param as end public function as return end end there alternatives to having to do this that we are unaware sure this is a common problem amongst many businesses developing typed stored procedure resolution in

what are the downsides favouring immutable objects in incompatibility with orm or presentation based frameworks are complicated by immutable objects since they constructor are no default arguments in which forces us to always provide all of the necessary dependencies overriding can be argument names are not usually available through which forces us to depend on argument order for dependency immutable objects is still a boring the compiler should take care of the implementation as in it possible to design a system object that predominately uses immutable immutable objects makes great building blocks for other objects favor since much easier to maintain the invariant of a complex object when you can rely on its immutable the only true downside to me is about creating many temporany objects concat was a problem in the

what i have understood there is a big difference between the included in the mvc release and the in the included in mvc my application i have many pages composed from many each having its own specific seemed to me more reasonable to use the method as each widget would have a dedicated controller responsible for getting different data and rendering a dedicated view opposed to having only one controller and a unique view model to pass to helper to render the tests i have done having a form that points to a create action method in a controller using new id calling it with render correcly with the same equivalent with using a action method on the controller to render the would not render correcly render that the action is this the correct way to use the helper and is it correct to use it in cases like renaming the partial view to renders the form

whole heartily join the recommendation to manually change the crt version you link if for some reason i cannot this is the right course of action for the way to do so is change the for your make sure a manifest is generated on every build configuration as it would overwrite your manual also make sure there that isolation is locate the manifest file should be at the you should see a section similar to debug of you need to edit the version and publickeytoken attributes of the crt can inspect the files at your local folder to see the versions check how to extract the publickeytoken once you find the version you first try and look directly into manifests of other linking against your desired crt you do go expect some rough you may have some luck if your application is a console app that does not link against other components if your application is be surprised if there some intricate version dependencies amont the sxs also need to distribute with your application the specific crt who did

why that called the stack to trigger is telling you what to acquire your resource in a i would one one utsttc is just one application of raii is much management resource is anything that needs cleanup after studies of projects across many platforms show the majority of bugs are related to resource management and particularly bad on windows to the many types of objects and resource management is particularly complicated due to the combination of exceptions and for a peek under the see guarantees that the destructor is called and only the constructor relying on raii can solve many nasty problems the average programmer might not even be aware here are a few examples beyond the local variables will be destroyed whenever i us start with an overly simplistic class employing explicit file if throw the only reason we are checking the file pointer for is because it might have been moved it is not needed to check against a failed because the destructor is never executed when the constructor if the following technicalities can be skipped on the first they are not crucial to understanding the basic idea of if you plan to implement your own raii it is absolutely essential that you read on it does not make sense to copy a file hence we disallow the otherwise implicitly generated copy the following operations enable transfer of and require compiler support for rvalue a a resource is from one object to file file return construction fails an no other member function not even the destructor gets avoids using objects in an invalid it already makes life easier before we even use the let us have a look at temporary filehandle are three error cases to no file can be only one file can be both files can be opened but copying the files in a would have to handle all three cases releases resources that were even when multiple resources are acquired within one let us aggregate some filehandle this logger can write to two files at const if throw constructor of will fail if constructor fails could not be constructor fails could not be or writing to the files inside constructor body in any of these destructor will be called so we cannot rely on destructor to release the but if was its destructor will be called during cleanup of the simplifies cleanup after partial all problems can be solved with raii and smart pointers is sometimes unwieldy when you need delayed pushing aggregated objects onto the the logger needs a in that the that still needs to be a member of needs to reside on the heap in a smart to trigger the destruction have never wished for garbage collection when i do i sometimes feel a moment of bliss that i just do not need to but much more i miss all the cool toys that can be created through deterministic just does not cut have had one particularly complex structure that might have benefited from where smart pointers would cause circular references over multiple we muddled through by carefully balancing strong and weak but anytime we want to change we have to study a big relationship gc might have been but some of the components held resources that should be release note on the filehandle it was not intended to be just a sample but turned out thanks johannes schaub for pointing out and fredoverflow for turning it into a correct over settled with the approach

work in recently ran a software development procurement process and selected three vendors to work on an agile some were already sure we wanted to run an agile project because we knew our requirements were ambiguous and because it was a web project with a significant design so say that it helps a lot if your client knows about agile and buys in from the even if they actually practice it note that acceptance of agile is growing in government so this may get safeguard we used was to contract a very experienced scrum master to work for us and handle the software project management duties on behalf of our team lead architect usability we spent a lot of time finding this and selected them from three great this was costly but worth we had selected our vendors and broadly agreed their roles we put together a quick mou outlining our intention to the likely budget of the the likely size of the team from each a commitment to have a full contract signed by the end of the and a time materials agreement in the we jumped in with a technical planning sizing session and got that side of things no dev work or design was done in this but we did a lot of sizing and the end of the month we put together contracts for each vendor was but that was one vendor put forward sample contracts that we might one based on payment by thirds of the the other on completion of i think in the end we did completion of sprints using some of the language in the payments section of our standard contract we were okay with this approach acknowledging some because we think there was a huge amount of actual technical risk in the project and because we had a lot of confidence in the procurement process and in the vendors we had the end this was a very successful and we have since started using scrum for other i think having a great team was we were confident in the vendors not only that they could do the but that they were a good fit in terms of their attitude to working as one and in terms of there being roles for each they would not be competing for the same our vendors had not been so we would have had a few more reservations about entering into a contract like but running procurement is almost as much an art as a and we knew we had chosen the team with the best fit an attitude from a pool of other have since rolled over all three contracts for a second year of though say it s not going quite as smoothly this time scrum different team it is still a great project to be involved may also find this

work primarily as a c because the application is with a fairly long history originally developed in the early the application suite originally was developed for unix based graphical my previous job was a similar a mature distributed application that was developed on multiple unix originally in the early and due to the source code size and it would be difficult to justify simply throwing that code base away to move to a new development language or even migrating to would imagine there are still a number of larger for internal not sold as a applications written in c that are still being not entirely unlike the massive cobol applications that large companies that are also still being development in others have already mentioned the embedded systems where the development is often for software put into rom or flash memory where it is referred to as for atmel where object code ram and performance matters so the usage of a programming language with fewer or generic abstractions or assumptions is critical thing about good to great c is that they are expected if not required to know more about data structures and priority binary and should be at least vaguely this is because the c language lacks the and other standard libraries available in other this is at least partly because most implementations are to lack of templates or dynamic typing or similar to have generic enough routines to be useful in more than one programming language is not a bad even if you feel comfortable enough to claim to be comptent enough to program in the additional langages a scripting or web development language might be a good and ruby are good potential programming functional languages like objective and scala are good candidates for making you admittedly prolog is actually a declarative logic programming but it is still programming experience	
work tried a pilot project to migrate historical data from an erp the size of the data is on the small only covering over 21 million the largest table having 16 million an additional million rows waiting to come into the pipe but the pilot has been shelved due to other the plan was to use facility to schedule queries that would regenerate data on a daily basis suitable for use in simple aggregates over the large record the first thing i noticed is how sensitive it is to the amount of ram an increase in ram at one point allowed for a worth of aggregates without resorting to sequential table you decide to use i would highly recommend the config as it tends to ship with the most conservative settings possible that it will run on systems with little tuning takes a little maybe a few but once you get it to a point where response is just set it and forget you have the tuning done all about turn your attention to your indexing and query planning also requires a little effort but once set find it to be partial indexes are a nice feature for isolating those records that have data in i highly recommend this feature if you are looking for exceptions in a sea of similar use the table space feature to relocate the data onto a fast drive

would be how i expected things to the block will not release its resources until it so in that sense the resource has escaped lexical however but this is no different to making a function call that tried to use the same resource within a with block nothing helps you in the case where the block has yet for not really anything specific to thing that might be worth worrying about though is the behaviour if the generator is i would have expected the block to act like a block and call the part on but that seem to be the	
would be little value in doing if you create the variable name from the there would be no way to reference that variable in your code following since the code is compiled at compile and trying to set variable names at variable names are really just there for the compiler to be able to map into and eventually jit this is why obfuscation works one of the main things most obfuscators do is scramble all of your variable names into very meaningless this has no effect on runtime behavior the names are meaningless once recommend going with john or something

would be preferable to redirect the client to another page after the if you really need the client stay in the same you can use a variable on your page to state if the insert has been and skip the insert logic if it has been executed

would be tricky to do this in unless you have enough control over the code generation it cannot be done entirely your routine would have to manipulate the such that when it returned everything was but the stack pointer remained in such a position that the block of memory remained in that problem is that unless you can inform the compiler that the stack pointer is has been modified across your function it may well decide that it can continue to refer to other locals through the stack pointer but the offsets will be

would call than one person can live at an address so checking the resident is an address is an address regardless of who is living knowing your hard to confirm but defining equality between two parents based on their childrens relationship back to them seems a bit your parents really have no way of identifying themselves without checking their do your children really have a unique id and of or are they really defined by their parent and its relationship to their you have some kind of unique that is unique only because of its i would suggest your equality tests should recurse to the and make an equality check based on the tree relationship	
would certainly ever checking in i would absolutely ban it is appropriate to check code into source saying do is too think we all agree with these check dead code into source check broken code into source at least to trunk and only very rarely to a private you have temporarily commented something out or broken something for debugging check the code in until you restore the code to its correct of are saying there are other such as removed or an incremental but incomplete improvement that includes a small amount of code as documentation of what comes or a 1 snippet of commented out code showing something that should be code should always be accompanied by a comment that says why it is commented out not just and gives the expected lifetime of the for following code does more harm than so is commented but needs to be replaced before release comment like the above is appropriate if you are delivering a hotfix to stop a bleeding and you have the immediate opportunity to find the ultimate after delivering the the code is a reminder that you still have something that needs do i check in one example is when i am tentatively removing something that i think a high probability will have to be in the near in some the code is there to serve as a direct reminder that this is the old version is in source control and you could just use a comment as a flag that something more is sometimes not code is the better when a bug is fixed by removing one line more two of sometimes just comment out the line with a comment to that code with a reason this sort of comment is and m only check in complete the task is too large break it into smaller completable this is the sometimes neither option is achievable when you are working on production code and have an critical problem to sometimes to complete a you need to put a version of code in the field for a this is especially true for data gathering code changes when trying to find the root cause of a the specific instance being asked about in the more general question as long as the developer is checking code into a private branch that will see but that developer perhaps someone the developer is collaborating it does little but that developer should never deliver such code into trunk or an trunk should always build and should always delivering unfinished code to trunk is almost always a very bad if you let a developer check unfinished or temporary code into a private then you have to rely on the developer to not forget to scrub the code before delivering into clarify in response to comments to other if code is commented out and checked my expectation that the code will function if uncommented drops with the length of time the code has been commented refactoring tools will not always include comments in their almost if i put code into the code is there to serve as a refined something more specific than that something needs to be done it is not something that should have a long if you can find code in every source then something is delivering code into trunk for reason should be a rare if this occurs then it becomes clutter and loses its

would like to make the following comments these are from some company guidelines where the products are translated in different following these guidelines has given us development team rather than the whole the greatest productivity in try to reuse snippets of error for think that because you have the two errors selected the wrong menu and menu item is not yet you can extract into a separate item and use it in both messages should be self contained as their translations may change based on a knowledgeable about if you go near a service like going to get everything you for is everywhere on the it become in not to embed variables your messages as has where changes since positions gender may table est est or red vs table better to use a generic noun with appended item has failed translate things which the user is expected to log messages in a log file only you will should be in english your native not translated to something like swahili that you read should be sorted by not collating units should be stored to the code and loaded in at this makes translation an issue of just shipping off the external not trying to shoehorn changes into the middle of it also makes adding other languages easier in enough for better to stop before you all fall asleep

would normally say that you should leverage your experience in programming for machines that are and low on web development is a very different web servers will usually have a lot more computational power and either the lamp or other requires a different paradigm of you will often spend more time on integrating multiple processes scripting than actually pushing out more speed and the transition is not so like the previous answer you may want to consider going the development you could get the development kit and begin whatever you can get your hands on within your

would probably be slightly easier in wpf because of the thumb control which provides easy to use support for i remember in winforms you would need to handle the mouse events whereas the wpf thumb does this for you and translates them into drag delta and end if you are much more familiar with one framework than the other than that would probably dwarf the difference that the thumb control would should also have a look around for that could handle this for you i think they exist for both winforms and wpf sure	
would probably have been less confusing to name references as others have references in should be though of the they refer not as a to the as i think of a good reason they be dealing with it often makes sense allowing null as a value you probably want a reference if you specifically want to disallow holding you could always code your own smart pointer type	
would probably use linq to xml and to generate the new object and then pass that object to the json	
would put the xml construction code inside the domain that you can just call from web service or data	
would really only make sense when you have a model hierarchy where the view is showing the common properties of the various child this could work but as a practical matter i see this happen very in my code the only place that i approach something like this is with a contact i have a user model that has a self contact and an emergency both contacts are of the same type with the differentiator being whether the relationship is or something i have a single view for creating these contacts and that view is rendered by 2 different actions on the same controller createcontactinformation and even this both use the same model i could have chosen to subclass the but there really enough of a distinction to warrant that the general case i would say that a view is used by a single controller and each controller deals with a single primary ancillary models to the primary may be handled by the primary controller or have their own depending on how you want to structure the	
would recomend we use that at work and its the only downside is that we end up with a lot of value objects that are only used to transfer data between and and the fact that the standard naming style and the flex naming style has some minor differences makes value objects a bit ugly in either flex or

would recommend putting your website code under full version control or test and maintain your source in a private sandbox and just check out the latest stable version at the production site whenever ready for database even for small projects i maintain separate development and production you can version the sql used to generate and maintain your schema and testing or bootstrapping data along with the rest of your manage the database environment used by your site from an easily separated configuration and tell your version control solution to ignore urls are going to be a if you avoid you could always store the hostname in the same configuration file and read it as except within stylesheets and javascript of my second choice for that problem would be magic or its equivalent in the development and my last choice would be just messing with the file when i wanted to test features that depend on

would recommend that you change your architecture to work more like a parser in a want to create a lexer that returns a sequence of and then a parser that reads the sequence of tokens and does stuff with your case the tokens would of would treat by its self as an embedded new and therefore include it as part of a column data a would constitute an end of line has the advantages only 1 pass over the storing a max of 1 lines worth of as much memory as possible the string builder and the easy to change should your requirements a sample of what the lexer would look i even let alone this so need to clean it up and make sure it public tokentype type private public string data private public type public string type data var builder new while var c switch case if yield return new yield return new case var next if if yield return new yield return new if yield return new string var ret return code would then look like void var columndata new bool lastwascolumndata bool seenanydata foreach token in switch case seenanydata if do some error lastwascolumndata case if lastwascolumndata case if seenanydata lastwascolumndata if

would seem to me that many large enterprises already have robust directory services such as active directory and it would be silly to constantly duplicate users in an if you require duplicating the user you can provide a mechanism to authenticate against active you could support a sso mechanism that leverages for the xacml duplicating information on roles and entitlements is equally for the spml many enterprise leverage identity management toolkits and would at least like out of the box integration in terms of centralized management and why open source projects considering this type of functionality as a default to getting on the radar within an enterprise come open source applications that are targeted at have these security

would suggest two interfaces and dependency as a way to decouple your interfaces give you a way to define a contract or set of expected behaviors that is independent of any when you have a class depend on an interface rather than on a you get the freedom to substitute other classes that implement the interface without having to rewrite the class that is depending on you use interfaces with dependency give the class the actual implementation that it is to work on rather than have it create a particular implementation on its you achieve even more decoupling in your now the class only knows about the interface and even know how to create just use dependency injection is often used with creational patterns such as builder or where you localize the construction of objects in a single class so that only that class need change when you extend the application with additional remember that coupling its is a relative you eliminate all coupling or your objects be able to having some level of dependence is you need to balance it with ease of use and implementation as for your particular hard to tell without actual i suspect that you are the solution and violating the dry principle repeat you may need to look at ways to use interfaces and perhaps a lightweight wrapper to decouple your classes from the framework component rather than a complete

would think the best option is to let the php script first set a flag in the session array to indicate that it is processing a that way a second request can be set to wait until the original request has completed a sleep call server side waiting for the flag to is important not to interfere too much with the submit button and because the nature of the web is one of the user may want to click a second time if no answer has and you want to lose their that could occur if the first request is lost and you have disabled their only way to submit therefore the cleaner solution is to submit the and use javascript to display a message saying so that the user can see that something is but they are not prevented from the

wrote quite complex shell scripts and my first suggestion is the reason is that is fairly easy to make a small mistake that hinders your or even make it i have other resources to pass you but my personal is what i normally which is but tends to be although your script accept long and short be careful because there are two commands to parse getopt and use getopt as you face less bash test echo exit set case shift shift echo unparseable option option exit test echo missing exit important point is that a program should always return zero if completes if something went can call functions in just remember to define them before the functions are like they can only return numeric this means that you have to invent a different strategy to return string my strategy is to use a variable called result to store the and returning 0 if the function completed you can raise exceptions if you are returning a value different from and then set two exception and the first containing the exception type and the second a human readable you call a the parameters of the function are assigned to the special vars i suggest you to put them into more meaningful declare the variables inside the function as foo local prone unless you declare an unset variable is used as an empty this is very dangerous in case of as the badly typed variable will not be and it will be evaluated as prevent this to be careful because if you do the program will abort every time you evaluate an undefined for this the only way to check if a variable is not defined is the test echo not can declare variables as can achieve modularization if you use the following getscriptabsolutedir used to get the script the script local local absolute path if the first character is a if test importer routine to get external the first location searched is the script if not search the module in the paths contained in environment the file to without if test echo unable to import unspecified exit if test echo undefined script absolute did you remove exit if test echo empty script exit if test import from script elif test import from the shell script library save the separator and use the local for path in if test restore the standard echo unable to find module exit can then import files with the extension with the following will be searched in as you always import in the global remember to prefix all your functions and variables with a proper otherwise you risk name i use double underscore as the python put this as first thing in your avoid double test return oriented you cannot do object oriented unless you build a quite complex system of allocation of objects thought about but you can however do oriented you have one instance of each and only i do i define an object into a module the modularization then i define empty vars to member an init function and member like in this example avoid double test return an example for module enum used in the mysql in this prefixed with bash variable cannot start with will contain the executed mysql command init the module with the database the mysql config if test already return local i am aware that i could put default parameters and other but i am lazy if test parameter config return mark the module as return gets the name of the person the row the if test not return if test parameter return local name from table where id if test 0 to perform return return and handling found this useful to catch and handle signal handler for echo signal handler for echo signal handler for end of the program or probably redundant we already call the cleanup in catch signals and exit int term and something does not work for some try to reorder the order is important and not always not even consider working with it does not support and horrible in it although please if you have to use the kind of things i wrote it means that your problem is too complex to be solved with use another i had to use it due to human factors and

you a web page most of the time scripts are reloaded from you can force the browser to reload the external script by holding down the shift key while clicking the refresh that work you might want to check if there is a proxy server sitting between you and the web if it is a local web the shift button should do the	
you accept a a new socket gets the old one is still used to listen for future you want to only allow 1 connection at a you could just accept the and then close the new accepted socket if you detect you are already processing there a net difference that you are looking for compared to closing the new accepted socket right after the the client will know as soon as it tries to use its socket right away if it is already waiting on the server with a read with a last error server actively closed the	
you add a new query to a given it is going to assume the schema in which it is attached which is why you are getting blank values for the columns you you mentioned having already created the what you need to do is use the server explorer to connect to the database and simply drag that stored procedure over into your xsd work what this will do is create a separate queryadapter that will have just the columns you specified strongly and you can with your gridview using that queryadapter	
you add a reference to the web visual studio will automatically generate code for the objects that are used as parameters to the functions of the web this is where your class comes is not the same as your you can remove the class from your namespace and just use the one from the web service proxy	
you add a something and mark header on each in the change group	
you add the hosts which are allowed xdmcp access to not on a box with xdm at the moment but if i recall correctly there should also be a config file which could contain relevant have a look at you may need to restart x after these configuration changes off	
you all for your there is a check already before executing drop view whether view exists or problem with drop view will arise only if there is a lock by another for now as you i have moved all the dml transactions after executing drop that way even if the drop view statement will rollback all the previous there will no problem as that is the first statement am	
you already discovered index is written at the end of avi why avi format is not good for should convert your video to some other format which has the indexing information at the for	
you and you should also document code review expectations and it have to be a lot of but having at least some will help you later	
you are acessing something from within your own why not just use a private named as you see return a value return void sometype localvar internal char myclass sometype x external return	
you are already using a you might as well use the builtin which maps names to thus if you changed your regexes to named you could easily use to retrieve the matched a successful should have the keys and and the values will correspond to what was your original hash could be changed to something like groups	
you are comfortable working with vb be a problem at think you should simply dive into it and google articles that pertain precisely to what you need to also since you are new to the it is quite important that you do not any behavior but instead test throughly every piece of code you really really doubt if you should read that 1000 page book for novices there are better things a man must do with his time	
you are covering 2 tables there is afaik only 2 ways to enforce as you view with unique constraint accross the 3 far as reliability is concerned i would go for the indexed view but the only downside is that it will be difficult to understand by third	
you are dealing with a reference you are taking a which is probably why you were told to avoid is not clear what you mean by if you mean a member of an object even accessible through a there is a greater risk in that since the object could be leaving you with an invalid since you cannot aim a reference later at something no way for you to indicate that it is so a pointer might be is no problem with the you explain what it is that you are trying to do or give more	
you are describing here is basically a choice between the record or the advise you to read up on those patterns and choose whichever one fits your application experience

you are going to be developing in i highly recommend sticking with this has a much simpler and works perfectly with the com especially with is just adding extra pain unnecessary at this	
you are going to be using the server only on the local machine and understand unix using urls will be simple and if you understand unix permissions and ssh and need to access it ssh will work while i see somebody else mentions it as pretty sure simply due to the need to understand unix you do not like or understand unix you need to go with svnserve or i would probably choose to run it in if you have firewall or proxy you may need to consider using much more and i think going to see the so put it last on your	
you are is so there is no way of determining if the origin of a request you receive now is the same or different to the origin of a request you 5 minutes are the only way around even server side sessions rely on cookies to maintain session identity across requests the security nightmare of passing the sesison id in the which anyone with malicious intent can sidestep	
you are keeping the session stored in a database server or a state the event be i think there should be no while a have to obtain a lock on an object like this shared can also try taking a look at	
you are looking to do why not just use xml linq to do it would probably be	
you are migrating a dump files can be very large so it is better to compress it before sending or use the flag of our methodology of transfering files is to create a full in which the incremental logs are flushed please check you mess any slave hosts if you have then we copy the dump and play afterwards we flush the logs again take the recent incremental log be very and play only keep doing it until the last incremental log is very small so that you can stop the database on the original copy the last incremental log and then play it it should take only a few you just want to copy data from one server to mysql will need to set the db users correctly and provide access to external	
you are moving the table you undoubtedly wish to use the space you gain to add ui that consider building the page in you can resize the table view to be where you like and put the ui elements above the you can use a uiviewcontroller to manage the page and add the protocol methods so that you can wire the uitableview back to your view controller as a then you can also wire the other ui elements to the same view	
you are not filling in the then pretty sure you should not attach is that you are going through a and would need to add the proxy p new webproxy new networkcredential wc new	
you are not limited to using i might recommend using hql instead for selecting a random since it may provide more flexibility to use the random function supplied by your db q hql statement	
you are primarily looking for invitations to copy and paste into a browser address it might be worth taking a look at the code used in open source browsers as chrome or to decide if the text entered into the bar is a search query or a url navigation	
you are really determined to transport the object graph across the network and preserve lazy loading take a look at some code i produced over here basically it creates a fake session on the other side of the wire and allows the nhibernate proxies to retain their not saying the right way to do but it might give you some	
you are really running into compilation slowdowns because of header the other option is to use an instead of an this is a rather unpopular approach since it degrades type if you do take this then i would also recommend adding code to programmatically do the bounds in class1 enum blah this is always eone klastblah this is always in check typename t u u castvalue if lower castvalue throw return end check in class2 void in not the prettiest but it does solve the header dependency problem by moving some of the type safety that static compilation gives you into runtime use similar approaches in the past and found that a namespace used in this way can make the resulting code almost as readable as based code with very little caveat is that you do have to make an effort to write code which i recommend regardless of whether you adopt this approach or not	
you are resisting to use because you know where should be i had the same problems when i was learning would recommend to you just to use different tactics in and with time you will understand it much i think it is just matter of and it was very hard for me understand it at first i read the same but understand it just keep learning it more and more for some period of

you are still having trouble implementing this functionality using linq to then you may want to solve the problem at the database level using row level essentially you could wrap each table with a view which implements a dynamic requires you to dynamically set each connection properties before a connection is made to the database each database user has a specific sql username and if this not a viable you may want to consider building a framework around the l2s context so that you can inject your own if you would like further havea read	
you are switch to pdo instead of it helps you write database agnositc code and have better features for prepared for from tablename where field1 field2 from tablename where field1 field2 execute with the parameters as an from tablename where field1 field2 will be easier for you if you would like your application to be able to run on different databases in the also think you should invest some time in using some of the classes from zend framwework whilst working with check out their and more specifically you do not have to use all of the framework or convert your application to the mvc but using the framework and reading up on it is time well	
you are talking about ssrs start here sqlserver reporting was a good book to get me ssrs are sql data driven reports represented in an xml format are hosted on and run on a web report as well as being rendered in html you can render them in tiff and more out of the is an introductory video	
you are talking about straight and not a specific implementation of a framework as there are many ways to implement the easiest of course is just to have your parent class object have multiple instance variables being the the children all accept methods like or in this particular car wheel car float etc self if return unsigned for i return self if return parent return

you are writing in you are probably writing for using new and the free store is much slower than using the stack when using so only use it when you need others have you need new when your object needs to live outside the function or object the object is really large or when you know the size of an array at compile try to avoid ever using wrap your new into a smart pointer let the smart pointer call delete for are some cases where a smart pointer never store inside a stl it will delete the pointer too soon because of copy operations inside the another case is when you have a really large stl container of pointers to will have a ton of speed overhead as it bumps the reference counts up and the better way to go in that case is to put the stl container into another object and give that object a destructor that will call delete on every pointer in the

you call external services directly from your presentation it creates two performance and it creates a security risk if you need to authenticate code in your dmz is if you have an application you should consider refactoring your service call to a private service in your presentation this will allow you to decouple the lifecycle from the lifecycle is problematic as you have

you could implement a but that would be the hard way in this you have a couple other options available first is that there is already a comparer you can there are a couple look in your intellisense prompts under second is that strings already have a way to specify a s as string t as string a third is that any passed to or is passed directly to the operating and windows is only for file not so you can pass your folder and file as a search pattern and do your lookup that	
you could implement multiple classes that conform to the uiapplicationdelegate protocol only the would receive these a protocol to create a delegate is only one part of the that delegate then has to be registered with the code generating the messages and these systems generally only support one the case of uiapplication you can change the delegate using the property in the uiapplication shared class but this will replace the original not add an additional you need to broadcast uiapplication level messages to other systems then this is functionality you should add to your existing	
you could solve shortest path problems with negative weights you would find a longest the two are this could be done by putting a weight of instead of standard algorithm for negative weights is the however the algorithm will not work if there is a cycle in the graph such that the sum of edges is in the graph that you all such cycles have negative sum weights and so the algorithm unless of course you have no in which case you have a tree a and the problem is solvable via dynamic we replace a weight of w by which guarantees that all weights will be then the shortest path can be found via standard if the shortest path p in this graph has k edges then the length is where is the length of the path with the original this path is not necessarily the longest of all paths with k p is the longest

you have an internal data structure that you want to prevent simultaneous access to by multiple you should always make sure the object locking on is not reasoning behind this is that a public object can be locked by and thus you can create deadlocks because not in total control of the locking means that locking on is not an since anyone can lock on that you should not lock on something you expose to the outside means that the best solution is to use an internal and thus the tip is to just use data structures is something you really need to have full control otherwise you risk setting up a scenario for which can be very problematic to

you have to read the compiler error messages the first error was is not a a is a namespace brings in all of brings in only baz from want to does two good it brings in a for you to and it bring in all the rest of which is good because you should only bring in what you so as to not accidentally depend on something you realize depending as foo is static in still have to refer to you do something like writing a free function that forwards to in this is a bad idea if only doing it to save some may advise not using using declarations at instead fully qualifying all this is quote and error and it gets in the way of say that you fully qualify every use of class and then management just before about to go to that you use very similar stack because barmatic just bought out your you fully qualified be doing a lot of hoping your regex was if you used a using you can just make a fix to your header in this a using declaration is a lot like a int or a manifest constant or int foo in that it provides one place to change something referred to many fully qualifying a namespace at every use takes away that had you used a using directive and brought in all of namespace your grep might have been even if say management insisted on but you still had to use the barmatic equivalent for baz being for whatever reason bringing in one type at a time is generally the most the way to best protect yourself against inevitable but as yet unknown as in most you want to minimize tedious repetition while keeping sufficient

you mean examples of then you need look no further than the talk about the input stream variant for the sake of but the same applies to output a look at for look at the arry and notice how at some point if calls which in turn reads from the underlying input around that it calls into the inflater to actually turn the buffer of bytes that it pulled from the underlying stream into the actual bytes that are written to the thing to consider is that filterinputstream is a little bit of a waste of so long as you can define your inputstream to take another underlying and in all the read you read from that underlying stream in mind that in theory you only need to define the byte then specifically making your class extend filterinputstream really buy you very for part of the code for an input stream that limits the number of bytes from the underlying stream that it allows the caller to read we can a stream into several which is useful when reading from archive for limitedinputstream extends inputstream private inputstream private long long public int throws ioexception if return int b return public int int int throws ioexception if return len int n if bytesleft return missed off boring implementations of this case in my it really buys me nothing to declare this class as a in a choice between wanting to call or to get the underlying

you set up a tcp the has to be unique this is to ensure packets are delivered to the right is a further restriction on the side that only one server program can bind to an incoming port number one ip servers have other powers but we need to discuss them at the server a that socket to a on that connections on that there can be multiple connections coming in per the client usually a little a the a client opens the it specifies the ip address and port of the it specify its source port but usually uses zero which results in the system assigning it a free port is requirement that the destination be unique since that would result in only one person at a time being able to use and that would pretty well destroy their business means you can even do such wondrous things as ftp since you set up multiple sessions where the only difference is your source allowing you to download chunks in torrents are a little different in that the destination of each session is usually after all that waffling the answer to your specific question is that you need to specify a free if connecting to a server with a call that specify your source almost certainly be using zero under the covers and the system will give you an unused

you verify that i got the question table represents vectors identified by the every vector has a dimension of something between 100 and but there is no order defined on the that is a vector from the table is actually a representative of equivalence you define the similarity of two equivalence classes as the minimum euclidian distance of the projections of any two representative of the equivalence classes to the subspace of the first 30 for projection to two represents the following equivalence class of projection of all representative of this equivalence class to the first two dimensions represents a equivalence class with 720 the projection to the first two dimensions yields 30 the distance of a and b is the square root of because this is the minimum distance of two vectors from the for example and yield this am i right with my understanding of the really naive algorithm for n vectors with m components each would have to calculate for each distance the algorithm would calculate the distances of projection for each so for 100 dimensions lower there are possible projection for a this requires to calculate about distances between projections and finding the minimum to find the distance of two and then repeat this n hope that i misunderstood you or made a else this sounds something between really challenging and not i thought about is ordering the vector components and trying to match using manhattan distance if possible may help to simplify the

you want to create a managed front end for a native you will have to marshal data back and there is really no way to avoid this currently facing a similar issue in one of our current the approach taken is to use pinvoke to talk managed with a few we only pinvoke blittable types which helps reduce the cost of marshaling because the clr can just implement it as a memory communicating native we use com we try to apply the same rules with regards to but found that you often have to include many com objects in this scenario which prevents this approach worked quite well from we spent a bit of time up front getting the primitives defined for the data but after marshalling became routine for lack of a better an overhead but a lot cheaper than a full

you want to develop an air you must use the air if you want to develop a flex application that runs on you need to use believe joshtnjala to be partially but i wanted to add on if using the flex you no longer require the air sdk as those tools are available to the flex it is important to because i see a lot of confusion or misuse of the flex is actually three sdk developers without the flash flex to develop and actionscript3 and mxml code to flash content for one could use flashdevelop for an and compile the code using the flex adobe flex is a open source framework for building highly expressive web applications that deploy consistently on all major and operating it provides a language and programming model that supports common design a declarative is used to describe ui layout and and a powerful programming is used to create client flex also includes a rich component library with more than 100 extensible ui components for creating rich internet applications as well as an interactive flex application builder builder is merely an ide to assist in the development of flash or air this builder utilizes the sdk above to the framework may or may not be used depending on the developers many developers have taken themselves out of the flash ide nasty and began scripting their as3 purely in the flex builder ide as it provides many useful features for the not to mention its a very clean ui and is built on eclipse so it has many plugins and a solid community behind its being to expand on what joshtnala the difference between using the air skd and the flex is that if you merely want to build an air composed of actiosncript3 the air sdk is all you need if you intend to use mxml and any part of the then you must use the flex sdk this will allow you to use the many available components such as in your air so in the both will develop an air application as flex sdk incorporates the air development abstract your project figure out what you will if a component works for or if a custom implementation is then choose your this

you want to get down to uses an inverted index of the what this means is that google has an index of all pages crawled based on the terms in each for instance the term maps to this the google home and the wikipedia article for amongst when you go to google and type into the search google checks its index of all terms available on the internet and finds the entry for the term and with it the list of all pages that have that term referenced in veteran index goes beyond your simple inverted this is why google is the crawlers are very beyond just keeping track of the terms that are on any given web they also keep track of words that are on related pages and link those to the given other if a page has the term in it and the page has a link to or is linked from another web the other page may be referenced in the index under the term as all this and more go into why a given page is returned for a given you want to go into why pages are ordered the way they are in your search that gets into even more interesting get down to one of the most basic algorithms a search engine can use to sort your results is known as term document frequency simply this means that your results will be ordered by the relative importance of your search terms in the in other a document that has 10 pages and lists the word once is not nearly as important as a document that has 1 page and lists the word ten veteran google does quite a bit more than your basic search engine when it comes to ranking google has implemented the pagerank in short pagerank enhances the algorithm by taking into account the of a given at this may be judged by any number of factors that google just wont tell at the most basic of google can tell that one page is more important than another because loads and loads of other pages link to

you want to have only one insert in your trigger to avoid have a single insert statement insert into hist name values when deleting i want to use not not have a seperate insert statement for a wide not like there no replace in text not going to write the insert just replace with does have a solution but i seriously doubt that performs better than 2 inserts would the big main thing trying to avoid is having to managed 2 inserts when the table matthew battle this attitude all the those who write java or or have a do this is do they write code according to these rules and the problem is when these rules are applied to databases behave the same way code the code having essentially the same code in two is we avoid one would abstract that code to a function and call it from the two places and thus avoid maintaining it and possibly missing we all know the this while that in the end i recommend two they are separated by an you change one and forget the other right not in a different or in some compiled or even somewhere else in the same right beside each an else and the insert is repeated with instead of why am i so crazed about does it really make a difference i know two inserts be worse than other and it could be real reason is being prepared for the times when it does if avoiding two inserts just for the sake of going to miss the times when this makes a huge into from mytable flag column omitted for into from mytable flag including would say this is bad there are two i could easily replace and with a bind variable and flip it at and what most people would but if true is of the values and is you want two because you want two execution one is better off with an index and the other an you do have two inserts to not always bad and in this case good and

your first question about generically retrieving a search ldap directory server to the ldap protocol i exposes some operational thingies under a node called one of the things you can retrieve through are the which essentially can tell you what the different trees are hosted on this you can retrieve a search base for your be some ldap for servers can host multiple trees so you have to come up with a solution when multiple naming contexts are can be retrieved by querying the server for the dn and specifiyng that you want to get all the operational attributes as just some example for an openldap base note the returns operational should return something similar to that shown below openldap the values in parentheses are added explanations and are not returned by the rfc your second question about the availability of the think that you should rely on this one as it strongly depends on the schema used for storing user data most will have a attribute i but that depends on the flexibility you want to put into your perhaps the best way would be to make the configurable by the could even do this with the search base which would have some performance advantages need to search the whole tree when users are only located in a small subtree and no need to query the

your own product your is part of quality assurance and i would put it under informal testing category as opposed to more formal testing usually done by a separate qa your is aimed at giving a experience of using a product or service to people directly responsible for its design and for a feature rich application it might go deeper than formal testing and at the same time put a specific user when the formal testing normally covers breadth of software use cases and tries to operate in more objective and measurable annoyances that make is also a category of shortcomings very specific to an environment that can be only diagnosed the this really annoying rattling sound that seems to be coming from nowhere whenever cruising at and drives you absolutely yet none of the mechanics is nor willing to get down to the cause when the car is at the software application set of your own product goes far beyond the software it unavoidably encompasses the entire your dog lets to develop and better understand the techniques of using the software within a it is fair to say that some software is used within a number of widely different formal testing might not be able to cover each of these contexts in simply because it might be difficult to define formally what specific tests you need to do once something has or it might be too expensive to mimic these contexts inhouse or go through all the known tests cases every time the software has slightly change testing is really good at checking that changes done to the software do but the other important area of evolution where formal testing is struggling is when you need to detect the changes in the software environment or usage patterns that come from the external using your own product will help detecting these changes much probably before told by the users on the quality of the user feedback is wrong with such there is no balance to strike between using your own product and formally testing it both as much as it is returns getting are worth the one is to compliment not to serve as a should do the is unless there is no dedicated resource to do the formal testing developers doing all the and you have to select how much time you can dedicate to any of the two important distinction here is that formal testing is best done by an independent people who report to the development and design on the other hand everyone marketers and even in should be using company products or services as much as because the core idea behind is to give everyone involved the experience of service or product they contribute to in a real life dogfood or can far as dogfood certain types of argument let not concentrate on how dogfooding eating your but rather think instead of what it getting a experience and with these of the actual next best thing to eating the food yourself is observing the dog whilst it eats the as opposed to relying on someone else telling you what your likes or the dev team members may not be able to personally put sewage control software to use in their everyday jobs nothing stops them from spending some time regularly observing a sewage engineer using the which follow the letter of but certainly captures it

your solution you can force markets to reference only distributors this table customers serial primary check in unique key table markets serial primary int not check foreign key references customers foreign key can reference a primary key or a unique key in the referenced note that if you have attributes that are irrelevant to putting them in the table would violate normal that the relevance of these distributor attributes would depend on the value in which is not part of the primary in third normal every attribute must depend on nothing but the primary this i would choose the second making a child referencing put attributes into the then the table can reference more
