 a biassed observer work for ibm on treat my comments with due your applications are written in informix you would have to do major surgery to move them to other you would need to decide which alternative interface to use your choice c as the basic is but oracle provides the oci and sybase provides the tds as with informix an upgrade to the current version clientsdk containing which more recent than the which you currently should be painless unless gone out of your way to write bad simply migrating the data might be a little traumatic not insuperably in the complexity depends on which data types you strings migrate date and time values less for but migrating the applications would require a lot of as you unless you were extraordinarily prescient and wrote a really good data abstraction upgrade to informix se would be a get the install point it at your existing probably want to recompile your programs to use the more modern but you could do that incrementally with care informixdir one for the old one for the upgrade to informix dynamic server would require you to export the data from se and import it into this would be very simple once you have ids up and getting ids up and running takes more effort than but is not all that my recommendation is to stay put with the decision is of would we have to make code changes or just is very closely related to but they are ids provides an almost strict superset of se the places i can think of where there are differences are primarily edge case has extra syntax to create table for locating files for the ids has a wholly different set of the basic create table is the same ids has types that se such as but the adornments are has create audit and drop audit and ids does not has other audit has start database and rollforward ids does not and logging in ids is main area that may cause issues is transaction ids has logged and mode as does in you are encouraged to use a logged database that would be a strong ids provides atomic statements in a logged database either the statement works as a whole or it fails as a many se applications are not written with transactions in there are some things you do when there are transactions on the such as open a cursor for update outside the scope of a this is what tends to bite code migrating from se to you cannot lock a table except in a and you cannot unlock a table except by commit or much of a problem this will be depends on what you were using in se and how the programs were designed they were designed rather than thrown an ids unlogged database and an se unlogged database are very close and you could migrate from one to the but ids can do things only when the databases are and you should aim to be using logged the migration to csdk should be just a recompile unless managed to do some really excruciatingly awful

 a comment on an answer asked about what in means to the type rather than an instance of the you access a static member another using the type name instead of a reference or a for static so called using type someguid instance called on a asstring static classes are usually used as the canonical example is probably it make sense to create an instance of math it just a few rules and classes always derive from you specify a different base or make the static class implement an classes have any instance members all methods etc must be classes declare any instance constructors and the compiler create a parameterless constructor by static classes came in people would often create an abstract class with a private which prevented no need classes are implicitly abstract compiled to il which describes an abstract but you add the modifier classes are implicitly sealed compiled to il which describes an sealed but you add the modifier classes be classes be in either or static classes have nested either or classes can contain extension methods

 a foreign key to a is the approach i in i use this even when i do use a database that supports enum i may skip the for the lookup and just use the actual value i need in my main table as the primary key of the lookup that way you need to do a join to get the table bugstatus status primary into bugstatus values table bugs serial primary summary status not null default foreign key references storing strings takes more space than implementation of but unless the table in question has millions of it hardly advantages of the lookup table are that you can add or remove a value from the list with a simple or whereas with you have to use to redefine the try querying the current list of permitted values in an for instance to populate a in your user a major with a lookup status from you can add other attribute columns to the lookup table if you need to to mark choices available only to in an you annotate the just simple option besides a lookup table would be to use the database supports them mysql table bugs serial primary summary status not check in this use of a constraint suffers from the same disadvantages as the hard to change the list of values without hard to query the list of permitted hard to annotate the equality comparison operator in sql is a single the double has no meaning in

 a great fan of does your method need access to the state of the if the answer is no it is probably otherwise you consider making it a static then go for access to state is less just as it is a good idea to hide private members that are not needed by other it is a good idea to hide the state from members that need reduced access can mean less it makes threading easier as it is much easier to keep static members there is also a performance consideration as the runtime does not need to pass a reference to as a parameter for static course the downside is that if you ever find that your previously static method will have to access the state for some then you have to change now i understand that this can be a problem for public apis so if this is a public method in a public then perhaps you should think about the implications of this a never faced a situtation in the real world where this actually caused a but maybe just go for by all

 a index on the are ordered by a index on the to table are ordered by can compare a database to a a when we insert a new we need to squeeze it between the existing which is slow on insert but fast on a we keep a separate file index file which orders our we insert the new we just it to our main file and update the short index which is fast on insert but less efficient on real databases indexes use more efficient binary but the principle remains the indexes are faster on indexes are faster on update	
 a indexes perform but gist indexes are more you want indexes if work for your data there was a recent post on the pg lists about a huge performance hit for using gist expected to be slower than is the price of but not much work as you might post by tom a core postgresql main point of gist is to be able to index queries that simply not indexable in one would expect btree to beat out gist for i think significant point here is that winning by a factor of a pretty and might point to some

 a legacy system that is making heavy use of datasets and little or no possibility of replacing these with business objects or more efficient data there any techniques for reducing the memory footprint of a am thinking about things like setting initial capacity removing but i have little experience with datasets and do not know which specific options might be available to me or if any of them would matter at am aware of the refactoring but i am looking for quick fixes given a set of datatable objects stored in a which properties are known to affect memory to the way data is stored setting the initial capacity could be one as this would prevent the object from allocating an arbitrarily large amount of memory when adding just one more the memory footprint of an

 a lot of places my workplace has legacy code floating around along with more modern for example we have a server application that still uses the microsoft fortran77 the less old parts of the application are written for the visual studio 6 c compiler and lately there have been runours of writing some new libraries with vs 2008 the have a number of different mechanisms to each other including static shared memory memory mapped name pipes and tcp to stop a application from being able to use any old library such as one of the fortran77 ones written in a procedural my application understood the file format of a fortan77 or c library and was able to locate the procedure call it wanted could it marshal the managed objects call the procedure and unmarshal the i copied a library file from linux to windows and my application understood the file format could it call functions from that think the answers are to do with the various c runtimes that are needed to initialise each if so then at a fundamental level are those runtimes the broadly similar to the clr they have different features such as memory management in the put my question another if an alien dropped in and gave me a binary library file and a file format specification could i use it from it theoretically possible to access any library from what does pinvoke do under the

 actually like using and feel they can be very useful for making logical groupings in a for example i had a class with various derivatives which certain methods corresponded to different things child object splitting these up into regions makes it clearer where things and can give you a good overview if you have appropriately named could split these into partial like the designer class but ultimately that reaches a very similar and you have a lot more class files that need to name can also use but some of the projects working searching is and much better if you can learn your way around the and find things quickly than having to wait for a time consuming have also used them within a few algorithms for understanding and honestly i think advocate this and always better to split things up into but that so easy with the algorithms that working therefore breaking it up into logical and then adding more comments detail within the regions seemed the best bet to me at the and honestly is taking a modular approach to you have a with a description of what it you have regions within the method that explain what that section of code does and then you can go down to individual lines of code which may also be so it helps you to drill down to get more information quickly and think are fine for logical grouping in i think they can work in but should be avoided if splitting code into more methods is the most suitable

 advantage of strictly typed xml is that your code does not need to contain a bunch of stuff of the a and they error and b or and the d section in match the error so strict xml for stuff that your logic depends loose xml for stuff that you are just holding as disadvanatage is that you have to manage and version the but no more work than it would otherwise except that you catch problems

 agree with everyone who says automated hardware is a must using that approach to test embedded software with some of our we have built up large test stations full of hardware simulators and we use ni teststand with a mix of labview vendor etc to manage all of we have to test a lot of hardware why we have all of that if just testing software then you can scale it back to the bare testing a serial just build a device to simulate the serial traffic and exercise all of the messages a few to ensure the software responds testing are plenty of usb peripherals or embedded devices to simulate if timing is important have to use another embedded device to get the tight tolerances looking otherwise a pc will do just important part is to always know what testing and not to test anything other than if make sure the test is independent of the hardware to the largest degree if testing waveform generation or something with a separate out the tasks test the hardware with a special build of software on the embedded device that do anything fancy except spit out a prearranged sequence of voltage then you can see if your references are if your filters are set to the wrong then you should be able to test the software independent of the hardware use a development board to test the software and verify behavior at the processor pins is	
 agree with here are some answers specific to your make the assumption talking about i see the other functions that in like any schema you can view the functions and packages in sys using a database development tool such as plsql developer or oracle sql however my experience has shown that referring to oracle documentation available is a better way to learn about the available functionality than jumping straight to the source is the query for doing recommend the use of one of the development tools failing from where type in found the functionality looking for use the describe command in sqlplus to determine the method signatures and data what situations is this sys is most often often used as a super user for adminstrative tasks as it has more privileges than a common sys also contains a lot of the infrastructure on which oracle depends mess around with the objects that sys will be the information about sys is stored in the methods i have suggested above but i recommend you read the online documentation rather than dive straight into the

 agree with john this really to answer your you basically need to rewrite the there are two ways you can do the whole file into memory with the offending line this case probably easiest to convert the string array into a then remove the all the rest of the lines back with potentially convert the into a string array again using means you have to know that got enough memory an both the input file and a new output file a with and a line if you want to delete write it to the output file read all the close both the reader and the writer you use statements for this will happen you want to replace the input with the delete the input file and then move the output file into

 am attempting to create a reusable navigation style in like a navigation bar on a it will contain links to all the main pages in my this control can go on top of all my pages in my giving a nice consistent look and feel across like a issue is in styling the current link differently than the other so that you can quickly glance at it and see which page since the control is the same on each i need to tell it which page is and have it style that link first thought was to simply place properties on the one for each and then set the appropriate property to true on the i could use one property that accepts an enum value instead of having many either in the control template for my header custom i can create a datatrigger that watches this relativesource all that my this but going to have to duplicate that and all the setters in for every single page i because the trigger has to directly reference the property which only applies to the one so i need a different style for every even though the actual style its describing is exactly the same which i the setters are the the only difference is what property the trigger is there some way to do this something with the same end without ending up with hundreds of lines of duplicated style active

 am creating a wcf service that will be consumed by both and java client do not have any java experience in the so are looking for guidelines or rules to follow to ensure that we do not accidentally include any types in our wcf service interface or do anything else that would preclude it from being consumed by a java client our worries if what should we be wary example of a concern is whether a value is represented in the service interface in a manner that can be correctly understood by a java second example of a concern is the use of any nullable value types present some of our development teams are files to define the various objects that the wcf interface methods will take as arguments and return as return they are then using to classes from rationale behind this is that it guarantees that the generated classes contain anything that is downside is that this adds a development burden and also precludes us from documenting these classes using tags equivalent of javadoc that a wcf service can be consumed by a java

 am looking for a specific hashcode that has the following i dont know of any such hashcodes and i dont know if it is possible to do such a just wanted to put it out there and see what people have two databases used term dont think of sql or anything of that one master and one there is a need to keep the two databases in sync and to detect when the databases are not in instead of verifying every data in it would be preferable to keep some hashcode that can be but the two databases dont necessarily share every since changes from master to backup are it is possible that certain modifications from the master to backup are lets say current state of database has elements and now b gets modified such that and then later the only change that will get sent from master to backup is the intermediate is instead of looping over every element in each database to verify that they we would prefer to keep a running hash code of the elements in both the locations and then just compare the hashcode would have to compute something previous hashcode of hm1 b changes hm2 hm3 master will have hashcode of now backup will not receive the modification so if it computes a running hash it will be like hb1 hb2 we want hb2 and hm3 to as the current state of the databases are the but most not hashcodes dont work this what we would want then is that we would want to the contribution of from the hash first and then the contribution of and then remove contribution of and add the contribution of into the hash so we want something like f modifies existing hashcode by adding contribution of a new while g modifies existing hashcode by removing contribution of an b gets modified to b get modified to is the new hashcode for the current state of the database b gets modified to hm5 and hb3 should as the current state of both databases is the are there such algorithms f and i hope i made the question function with reversible

 am looking for best practices for creating collections made from anonymous are several approaches one and most answers on thread assume that the whole anonymous collection can be constructed in one anonymous types are usually used to replace classes that are to be used to store temporary put forward in so i would like to avoid creating and using a class for anonymous as my i am iterating over a collection for each item in the collection i would like to collect related objects in an anonymous type as a i need these anonymous types to be put in a collection and then sort them for further approaches i have an or arraylist the benefit of the anonymous a wrapper class for the required items the need for the anonymous is the only place in my code that i need such a collection what would be the best am working with legacy so the collections i am working with are strongly typed collections implementing and as such most linq extension methods such as item in foreach confirmation in if lastparentid parentobject new itemholder new arraylist confirmation if use ended up using a generic dictionary to collect the related items together and using to sort them but it and is better than the existing type

 am reading the problem as server gets messages from client 1 and 2 and forwards clients are different meaning the messages they are sending could potentially be what you want is the messages from the clients to be sent alteratively out from your but not to if a client has this i suggest that you have two queues and in your will have to read from the sockets in two seperate and when a message comes in add it to its corresponding client1queue client2queue in a third have the server forward the alternating pulling these messages from client1queue and solve your problem of if the queue is empty simply skip that this insures sending all messages at the fastest possible rate while still getting all the messages the downside is that it only alternates if a message is ready to be you of have it wait for x amount to see if a message comes for the other but i see why you would want to if the system is supposed to work regardless of the client

 am surprised that so few are mentioning encapsulation here in an instance method will automatically have access to all private properties and in addition to all protected ones inherited from base you write code you should write it so that you expose as little as possible and also so that you have access to as little as it might be important to make your code fast which would happen if making your methods but usually more important then that is to make your code as incapable of creating bugs as possible one way to achieve that is to have your code have access to as little as possible of might seem irrelevant at first glance since the op is obviously talking about refactoring which can not go wrong in this scenario and create any new however this refactored code must be maintained in the future and modified which makes your code have a bigger in regards to new bugs if it has access to private instance so in general i think the conclusion here is that mostly your methods should be unless there are any other reasons for not having them and this simply because use of encapsulation and data hiding and creates

 am working on a ai using a technique known as i am attempting to train a network that can move around a two dimensional space given a variety of values that are stored in what is effectively a two dimensional can see two strategies for using the neural each in the provide the scores from the different heuristics as inputs to neurons and create a nn that is effectively a very complicated move the non playing character to the location with the highest a compressed value for each heiuristic measure compressed into as few bits as and provide an input neuron for each of these am quite interested in option two because it presents the least amount of calculations required runtime of the game is quite however i am confused as to what approach i could use to create the version of the heiuristic i know there are techniques such as fourier transformations out however i know if these will suit my basically i am looking for a way to convert a 50x50 array of doubles into one or maybe two double these two double values can be i need to be able to get the original values i just need a reasonable mechanism for changing the input data into a small alternative to these two possibilities is to somehow encode a based on some distance from the npc you get the actual values for a and an approximation for a i know exactly how i would wire this but it at least gets rid of the need to evaluate every cell every turn of the game i am looking at about 5 million rounds at approximately 1 second per any simplification i can come up with would greatly apologise if this making much it is quite a difficult problem that has stumped me for a and i think of an easy way to describe to add change to chris refined what i am looking what i am looking for is a way to approximate a line can convert the 2d map into a in as few parameters as i have used cubic splines for interpolation however i need something a lot more feasable for a that varies between and quite what i am realling looking for i suppose is a of the know there are techniques such as cubic splines that i can work out some and these values are a reasonable analogy for what i am looking i need a way to take the 2500 values and come up with a small representation of these values that i can use for the neural i think the nn can be trained to infer the true meaning of these or at least to determine some correlation between the representation and the real so it necessarily need to be a reversible but i think many one way functions as are actually going to be very helpful a 2d map of doubles in as few as

 and squeak are first and foremost very it is fairly easy to create a gui using you just draw a few copy some text the haloes of very much every morph allow for cloning and then you can drop these morphs into your new it is more difficult to add your behaviour to the ui you just created since you somehow have to find your widget in the code is the part where i would like to point out that i find the morphic implementation in squeak very maybe mistaken all of but this is how i see morphic was designed to allow you to graphically construct your own ui with just a few and it was designed so in the self programming where there is no registering your clone into the ordinary code tree is a triviality in is of course not trivial to export your but then in smalltalk that is never easy the real world morphic code that i come across usually treats morphs like any other ui framework creating the ui from ignoring the graphical i have not seen a convenient way to a morphic ui into a file the way interface builder does on mac os more if you click together a morphic it is difficult to access it from the code hint from neil to leave the whole morphic thing aside and turn to mvc might be the few times i have had to deal with user interfaces in i examined ui generation code from around the image and tried to mimmick their	
 and ssl are similar protocols that both use most of the same cryptographic primitives under the so they are both as secure as each one advantage of ssh is that using authentication is actually quite easy to and built right into the ssl a bit of a mess involving ca certificates and other after you have the pki in place you also need to configure your services to use the pki for authentication instead of its internal password this is a nightmare on some services and a piece of cake on it also means you need to go to the hassle of signing all of your keys so they can log in with competent users can grok ssh keys in no time but it takes a bit longer to get their heads around ssl keys extra ca certs and key certs confused me when i first discovered is great for unix but ftp over ssl is probably easier to do if your users are and are pretty clueless about anything other than internet exploiter you mind risking that your users will choose insecure

 another language will make you a better especially when the paradigm is significantly different from any other language you already c will give you a much better grasp of what you are actually it will be like being accustomed to a full featured graphing calculator and then learning to do all the and graphing yourself with just a blackboard and it will be a lot of but if you your mental model of the code will be much closer to what is actually happening in the really necessary to be a good i believe one of the characteristics of a good coder is the ability to understand the code in a higher level of and to see the system as a low level knowledge help you with the big if you want to be you have to move beyond just you should be able to understand the system at many different levels of abstraction from the upper conceptual diagram level down to the bare machine code knowing c will help you with understanding the low being able to debug c will help you with troubleshooting at all allows you to do the low level operations of but adds a bunch of abstraction mechanisms and code reuse facilities so you can be a little more if you already know a higher level language like and so i would recommend that you make some effort to become skilled in c and not try to tackle just the purpose of learning another language should be to expand your that even if you end up using it in a professional or hobbyist you will still improve your coding and analysis skills for the languages that you do

 answer to this question honestly depends on the exact package system talking and how you have it some upgrades can break backward compatibility so the question much is going to break and how long will it take to fix as a rule of thumb i prefer to attempt an upgrade in a development and deploy to a testing environment to see how much work it will real reason i prefer to keep everything at the current version is are not usually kept and when the particular version of the product is no longer supported the task of upgrading to the latest version tends to be quite time consuming and and as such prefer to do a little work each time something can be upgraded rather than waiting and having to sort through everything later

 appears to me that you have two totally one for value1 and one for when you use the value1 key to the records necessarily returned in order of so they have to be this is still better than a full table scan since only sorting the records that satisfy your think this is possible in a composite key on would solve table id not null value1 unsigned not null default value2 not null default primary key key value1 key value1and2 default the equivalent assuming the correct syntax in mysql for a composite all databases i know i have to admit mysql one of that would cause the db engine to select the value1and2 key for retrieving the rows and they would already be sorted in so need a file can still keep the value2 key if you need

 approaches to copy objects in java have serious method is so you call it directly unless the class in question overrides it with a public call the any it will allocate assign the internal field you can read via and copy the fields of the more issues with see item 11 of joshua book second is even it has many of the flaws of and then joshua has a whole chapter with four items for this topic solution is add a new interface to my interface t copy t createforcopy void copyto code looks like demo implements public demo copy demo copy createforcopy copyto return public void createforcopy return new demo public void copyto fields of demo i have to copy this code to all my objects but always the same so i can use an eclipse editor can decide which constructor to call and how to initialize which happens in a deterministic order class to instance can reuse existing objects and overwrite stay standard java types i use a utility class which can copy the methods have flags and so i can control how deep a copy should

 are a couple of things going on java framework is offering you a nice way updated your ui but constrains you to using a specific the other hand you have a adequate model that represents your by using document directly in your model you also take the risks of tying your model to a specific which a good java document framework offers the ability to listen to changes you can leverage this into creating an between your model and basically when you setup the form you will make an instance of the adapter you will initialize with your the adapter will have a property returning a in addition the adapter will register itself as the listener for that document the adapter will be smart enough to know how to translate the chances to the document model to your something like is created along with the creation process it model from the create an instance of the it with your adapter also sets itself up listener of the the document to interaction with the document back to adapter notifies the the translated data view changes the view nofitifies the adapter model has adapter translates the into changes to the the adapter is tied to the java framework is should be pushed as close to the ui as it can likely the adapter will implement a interface exposed by the view so that the view have to reference anything specific to the framework you are when you change framework all you have to do is make a new object that implements that interface and the view is none the

 are actually quite a few alternative the reason for so many versions is partly because while ruby itself has a lot of mri is often considered to be not quite as nice as the language it is a list of all the other ruby implementations i know for its speed advantage as great now that ruby is but still a big player for its integration with in for for making native mac os x currently based on ruby but going to release a new virtual machine for the next which looks to offer a major speed boost and will hopefully be portable to other llvm target very much in for web it will probably be a commercial is a reimplementation meant as an alternative to mri with a much cleaner doubt blue ruby will have much of an impact on the general software development it will probably be nice for sap programmers and allow them to cast a wider net for potential hires since ruby is somewhat more popular than of the current ruby implementations are compiled to contrary to as of ruby mri itself includes a bytecode though the ability to save the compiled bytecode to disk disappeared somewhere in the process of merging the yarv virtual jruby is compiled into java i have a lot of details on but it seems safe to say it will take that road as

 are some things to think you want to cast or you want the result as a or an the result is an do you want the to be applied lazily the will not actually occur until the iterator reaches each distinction between since a casting operator often involves constructing a new and could be considered a implementations should automatically apply conversion operators defined for the types new object may or may not be implementations should allow one to specify a method implementations using existing suppose you pass as input a that you want to convert with any of the previous can return only a lazy also fails to use existing explicit cast because such a cast possible in for a generic type parameter says unless toutput has an explicit conversion operator defined for to this confusion is what lead to this topic in the first the cast to a generic type parameter not possible in this requires a as input instead of just an new would be except reflection is and must be used since hides the method name for explicit operators making it difficult to obtain a delegate any other methods should involve defined explicit conversion or allow one to specify a conversion language specification for conversion operators specifically their lack of a method name makes it difficult to obtain a delegate except through the alternative is to encapsulate or replicate the conversion increasing the complexity of your code since conversions are implicit in the presence or absence of conversion and should be handled by the we should not have to manually search for definitions of appropriate conversion operators with reflection at on the types methods for conversions using explicit conversion operators should really be a framework and with they except the language spec makes it hard to get a delegate for the conversion operators

 attempting to compile a working copy of the class library using the sources from the imagemagick and magicknet was unable to obtain a copy of the magicknet source files from the homepage as it is currently so i was forced to obtain the files and project file from courtesy of a google the instructions stated and i created a project using the option and compiled before moving to the magicknet project file and compiling that as after making sure all the paths pointed to the right i keep receiving this error upon error already defined in also receive 371 other all of them related to an external symbol and a final 372nd error describing that i have unresolved managed to solve the dllmain error above by commenting out the dllmain declaration from the source file from the project in the imagemagick however the 372 other errors still had performed a search for people with similar and have said that the author had offered a download of a magicknet dll which works however i mentioned his homepage appears to be inaccessible currently seeking one of these solution to my compilation as i may be making a mistake on my part since not familiar with at link to another magicknet source zip that is confirmed to compile correctly with the latest version of link to a working precompiled copy of the magicknet if anyone kept a copy from the it should be approximately 3mb as it contains the imagemagick libraries as would really appreciate any one of these as i desperately require ability to manipulate and convert as well as ease of i can provide additional details if you need more i am using visual studio 2008 to compile the source and the supplied projects convert with no issues at source compilation

 attempting to explain i like to use the example of navigating in a car via signposts versus a i realize it directly answer you question but it may driving a car and you reach a particular intersection you are provided signposts to indicate where you can go from that hypermedia provides you with a set of options based on your current traditional rpc based api is more like a with a map you tend to plan your route out based on a static set of road one problem with maps is that they can become out of date and they provide no information about traffic or other dynamic advantage of signposts is that they can be changed on the fly to detour traffic due to construction or to control traffic not suggesting that signposts are always a better option than a obviously there are pros and cons but it is valuable to be aware of both it is the same with it is a valuable alternative to the traditional rpc

 aware of and the suggestion apply in my want simple uids so that my users can easily communicate this information over the phone got a problem with opposed to got a problem with want those to be unique because i have a few different kind of there are order and delivery and and since no relationship between i have no way to guess what kind of object an id is referring unique i can immediately tell what object my customer is referring my user can just input an id in a search and i save him the to further refine what is looking current idea is to use identity columns with different seeds and an increment value of raises a few question though if i eventually get more than 100 object granted i could use 1000 or but something that scale well there a possibility the seed is a a database are there other issues i should be aware it possible to use an non integer currently use as an identity so that i can prefix the id with something representing the object example a varchar it be a good idea to user a containing only an identity and maybe the object so that i can just insert a row in it whenever a need a new i feel like it might be a bit and afraid it would complexify all my insertion plus the fact that i be able to determine an object type without looking at the there other clever ways to address my identifiers in sql	
 aware of two defensible and commonly practiced uses of the power to where you commit commit and in small the system may not be in a good state at every the major benefit of this practice is that you get a very clear view of what has been changed and and with a system like or a command like you have a chance at commits that interest where you commit only when the system is in a solid it not only builds but also passes regression a large group some sort of reliable scheme is a although you can still do commits locally and make them public only when in a solid many years i have observed consistently that most students and other beginners are afraid to commit and commit often for my own projects i tend to use the and for larger projects i typically carry at least two doing commits on one and commits on the

 be recommend doing this in your domain rather than in the domain logic in the database can make it hard to maintain and deploy later sure you can have constraints etc in the database to prevent invalid foreign key values but the generation of the unique value is a business and belongs in the business rule layer of your system the domain what is the reason for generating the unique value this would an identity column suit your purposes you could always use the identity column as part of a padded which would ensure

 because if you have never programmed gui it will give you a very deep knowledge about how this kind of applications without being so complex as another languages ides as it based on you will be concentrated on gui and not in the language itself because pascal is really and i think the course you are going to take will have emphasis in this not languages plus is that delphi has a lot of components libraries and is very easy to build a component by yourself a really easy as i so you will be very productive with the tools at your delphi you can build for windows native code o the you can learn delphi as a and move forward when your knowledge about this kind of applications has grown

 been a little way down the same path as yourself on previous projects and yet to see a clean approach to solve the i think the real answer is that soa causes as many problems as it the logic goes that by decoupling everything you can switch services and their implementations if the price that we pay for such a feature is code that turns into a spaghetti mess of and injected dependencies then is the benefit worth the hassle i say current approach to soa is to approach with we harvest services from conventionally written code once the the intent and implementation have settled

 been playing around with some things and thought up the idea of trying to figure out i have data for a site that for this purpose we can consider a social pretend that facebook simplification of i have people and i have a list of their so i have the connections between how can i calculate the distance from one person to another a kevin bacon best idea is a with a depth limit limit computational complexity and avoid the problem of people who simply be connected in the but i realize this is rather brute it be better to make little something equivalent to groups on calculate the shortest distances between them of and then try to use those to find a while this requires it could make it possible to search many fewer nodes could be groups instead of making the graph much this would still be a bidirectional search could also the number of people an individual is connected searching the nodes for people first since they could have the best chance of connecting to the given destination i realize this would be a of speed for possible shortest think also want to use a search instead of the search plan to use in the other someone think of a way of doing like to be able to find the shortest length between two so not as easy as always having the same end point as in the kevin bacon realize that there are problems like i could get chains of 200 people and but that can be solved my having a limit to the depth willing to	
 been playing around with the code contracts some more myself on a small but moderately complex standalone which needs to inherit from some bcl classes and use other contracts thing seems great when working in a completely isolated environment with just your own code and primitive but as soon as you start using bcl classes until do not have their own the verifier cannot check whether they will violate any of the and so you get a lot of warnings about potentially unsatisfied the other it does find some invalid or potentially unsatisfied constraints which could be real but very hard to find these because there is so much noise that hard to find out which ones you can possible to suppress the warnings from the bcl classes by using the assume but this is somewhat as these classes will have contracts in the future and assumptions will lessen their my feeling is that for because in trying to build on a framework that the verifier does not sufficiently that probably worth waiting for	
 been playing with mvc and ran into something i figure i have an object like this class public string name public int age a view page like this on my controller i have these actions actionresult return testobject name age 10 actionresult return method always genereates the textboxes with the default even after the where the object is passed back with different properties on its i think of a real world example why want to do such a thing but i still understand why i always end up having textboxes populated with the values that were set on the create action with the tried but the result is still the and i verified that the create action with actually by passing a value via viewdata to the the udated value is displayed when i output the value with but not on the there something obvious or is there a reasoning behind this mvc changing properties on	
 been programming in scala full time for about a i have nothing but massive enthusiasm for do you ever think that maybe people are enjoying using it too much to spends lots of time on at this late date think people would have learned to be more skeptical of the corollary of that lesson is not to assume too much from the lack of is not to say scala has not been but most of the hype appears to originate with people who use	
 been programming in while i coded a routine recently and it occurred to me that it was the first time i could that i deliberately used bare code blocks with no preceding the code looks vaguely like output var fooitems output p var baritems output p structured the code this way mostly as a sanity check that i going to accidentally reference the wrong variable mix up baritems and i also find the code a bit more i certainly could have factored the code into three separate but i felt that was a bit overkill in this you use bare code blocks in your why or why you use code	
 been reading up on protocol which allows for a variety of scalar value types to be used in to three types of integer primitives and in their they note that is for encoding negative numbers if your field is likely to have negative use but if you have a field that has no negative i assume that uint32 would be a better type to use than anyways to the extra bit and decreased cpu cost of processing negative when would be a good scalar to is the documentation implying that most efficient only when you rarely get negative or is it always preferable to use and depending on the contents of the same questions apply to the versions of these scalars as and but i left them out of the problem description for there ever a good time to use int32 instead of sint32 in google protocol	
 been rethinking my original answer i still suspect that using fewer threads would probably be a good but as just it actually be that io possible that just the files is taking a lot of disk i doubt that really running out of memory for the how much memory have you how much memory is the process taking how many threads are you and how many cores do you significantly more threads than you have cores is a bad suggest the following plan of out where the bottlenecks actually try fetching the list of files but not doing the moving see how hard the disk is and how long it with different numbers of with a queue of directories still to an eye on the memory use and garbage the windows performance counters for the clr are good for in c or using multiple processes what doing is akin to giving a single processor a hundred threads except doing it with the disk makes sense to parallelise tasks which use io if a fair amount of computation but if already disk asking the disk to work with lots of files at the same time is only going to make things may be interested in a benchmark and recently been testing of individual lines of a when the level of is low hardly doing any cpu the best results are always with a single

 been tackling similar problems and found a couple of solutions that emk can link to external sql data sources so you can use odbc to connect to a mysql database and share you can find more information we tried it and found it to be pretty slow to be is a product that claims to allow you to perform data replication and data transmission between mysql and other structured is possible to use web as a web service that your app can then push and pull data we found a couple of wrappers for this in and can put a trigger in the filemaker database so that every time a record is changed part of a record you are interest you can call a web service that updates a mysql or memcached version of that data that your website can found that people like filemaker because it gives them a very visual interface onto their data very easy to make quite large applications without too much development when it comes to collaboration with many users or presenting this data in a format other than the filemaker application we found performance a real

 been using for two and a half years is what i production of software version into several transition call them whatever you features for the very first for others plan enhancement and should be as granular as possible provided each ticket has a deliverable time on ticket creation is not a good more granular and smaller tasks more control over the earlier discovery of planning shortcomings and more time to manage can split even when in if developer reached the result that can be shown to the customer but did not complete the whole then developer can split the task and mark the completed part as or which gives some more granular the progress not weekly at least several times a trac is a very nice the best feature or trac is ability to put wikilinks including changeset if you demand putting ticket in changeset comment and then putting changeset number to the ticket comment this links the tasks and changes to the later these links make it easier to track the evolution of the it is a life saver especially if the project goes beyond a couple of month in

 been using the javascriptserializer class in the namespace to do this with great success and it be the key is that your javascript json object that you pass up to your controller method needs to have the same structure as the object trying to serialize it for say this is the target object in your testobject public string name public int age your javascript object would look like in your controller which would look something like you stringify your javascript object before you pass it to your i use the jsonresult var jss new testobject to return is untested and especially unsure of my json object but hopefully you get the also msdn may show the javascriptserializer class has been marked as but this has been actually the class that the mvc framework uses to do its json

 believe that there is a one place inwhich this information can be you can find out the last time a user logged on and what dc authenticated from but the problem is that when you login the first dc to respond is the server which authenticates that dc then logs this info to its which resides on each host and not in a central you can see more about this from these to so that being said i guess you could get the last login from the lastlogontimestamp ad property from the user account and then query the eventlog from all of the in the domain to find out which dc it was that authenticated them and from what but all of this will only tell the last lgged on all of teh systems that they could be logged again you could compare these results to the logoff times which can be pulled from the dc really this seems to be a major overkill and that you would have better luck writing a script which had these events logged to a central reporting system which you could use for future is another you can query your wins server to poll the logon information that it has for a which should return back the system inwhich it believes they logged see this post for how to do the command wins server show name username you are using some sort of management software such as desktop then you may have more luck exploring where the desktop agents log this information because they usually log this information also into some sql

 benchmarks so far show java and c are about on par with each your benchmarks are severely will always be orders of magnitudes faster then both and java unless you do something seriously that this is not an attempt to try to bully neither nor i like both java and and there are other reasons why you would for many problems choose either java or instead of but neither java nor would in a correct written tests never be able to perform with the same speed as because of the sheer number of comments arguing against my these two class public int public static void y new int idx new this one int myclass int idx idx version first of all needs to store its array on the the c version stores the array on the to store stuff on the stack is merely changing the value of an integer value while to store stuff on the heap means finding a big enough chunk of memory and potentially means traversing the memory for a pretty long mostly and java allocates huge chunks of memory which they keep on spending till out which makes this logic execute but even then to compare this against changing the value of an integer is like an f16 against an oil tanker of all in the c version since all those objects are already on the stack we need to explicitly create new objects within the yet again for this is a for available memory while the c version is a zip nothing of all is the fact that the c version will automatically delete all these objects when they run out of yet again this is an operation which changes the value of an integer which would on most cpu architectures take between 1 and 3 cpu the version do but when the garbage collector kicks in and needs to collect those items my guess is that talking about of cpu the c version will instantly become x86 code an x86 while the version would first become il then later when executed it would have to be jit which probably alone takes orders of magnitudes longer time then only executing the c some wise guy could probably execute the above code and measure cpu however basically no point at all in doing because mathematically proven that the managed version would probably take several million times the number of cpu cycles as the c so my guess is that now talking about orders of magnitudes slower in this and this is a in that i for something to prove my however i challenge those that commented badly against me on this post to create a sample which does not execute faster in c and which also use constructs which you normally never would use in c due to that and java are great i prefer them over c time of the but not because because they are they are slower then c and unless coded blindfolded in c or of course have the which would seriously change the speed for the above if we changed the class to a value type by using the keyword instead of the struct keyword means that would store new objects of the given type on the stack which for the above sample would increase the speed still the above sample happens to also feature an array of these though if we went through and optimized the version like we would still end up with something several orders of magnitudes slower then the c written piece of c code will be faster then python and i i love and most of the work i do today is and not however i use because faster then i use because i need the speed gain c gives me for most of my and java is though slower then and for that

 best guess is that the 2nd time you call openconnection you closed it and so you try to set the connectionstring property of an already open this in you want your methods to actually create a new connection every time along the lines of the factory so that the connection can be properly something more like sqlconnection better if the connection string is pulled from a config var result new connection string return will be no corresponding rely on the idisposable pattern to make sure the connection is always closed then you will use that function and connection in a method like datatable var result new string sql from where using cn using cmd new using rdr return statements work with any object that implements the idisposable and they guarantee your connection is closed even if an exception is notice that i made the method this is because this class will become your data access by making the connection you will enforce a good db layer where the only way to talk to the db is to come through this code that needs to talk to the db should go in if this class starts to get too big you can mark this method as rather than private and move your data access layer into own assembly project in visual the key is now to limit your methods to accepting input for try to build an generic method that lets you pass in the sql that way lies never connect to a database from your application via the sa and posting your sa account details to a public web site just that

 best thing to do for handling errors in your program is the because simple tasks are the least likely to services are most definitely the they add several more layers of technology and custom code that can application should at the very least write error messages with any important information about the error to a log so you can find out what next simplest step would be to send a simple indicating that the program had an with any useful email address and smtp server you need to successfully send the message should be in the configuration information for the you still want to add sending your error information to a web service after logging and fine at least you will have a log and message about any web services failures you

 better to make the display of div to be none rather than setting visibility to if visibility is set to hidden even if the div show up but it will take the rendering space which in some situation might not be that can dynamically create a div using createnode and then by absolute positioning and setting the top and left according to your convenience you can align the div to any portion in the its better if you could disable the background when the div pops	
 between events and delegates and its respective are the advantages of do i use wonder what the purpose of delegates i used them that much and really think of my written that a delegate is a for all methods that comply with its you can add multiple methods to one and then be executed after eachother in the order they were which is probably only usefull for methods that affect local variables or methodes that return any read that implements events as which is documented as represents the method handle an event that has no the source of the an that contains no event delegate void eventargs kinda can someone give a usefull example of this purpose of

 bind is not a method and there is no some object behind the scene holding binding just a word that page parser uses to generate code it translates into eval and control building the on the other will use reflection to access bound i understand correctly what you property binding already assuming you have a property title in your title have to either create your own template or reflect existing one and pass the extracttemplatevaluesmethod method and assign the databinding event to your this is where uses which replace with the property my that is what the databinding event is if you question is more about whether one can have a reference to a then afraid there is no property per you have to methods and and an entry in the you could store a reference to the object and property but then have to use could use the but that would take you back to the same code as the one which is defining extracttemplatevaluesmethod and doing databinding	
 binding is binding interface to its implementation at runtime any situation when the program automatically decides which code to call as interface so generally speaking both and are dynamic but the term is usually only used for binding early is the opposite of dynamic binding late in binding the knows exactly what code to call and gererates a direct call of that in dynamic binding the know that exact implementation is determined at

 boils down to the fact that the compilation phase has lesser information to work with and hence the runtime needs to do more work in case of duck typed if i am making the method invocation in case of java or the invocation to bar can be optimized in the compilation process by discovering the type of and then directly invoking the method at the memory location where the compiler knows it will be since a python or any other dynamically typed language compiler does not know what type the object foo belongs it has to do a type check at runtime and then look up the address of the bar method and then invoke are other difficulties a python compiler writer struggles with as though the one above hopefully adequately gives an so even with the best compiler statically typed languages are likely to perform much better at dynamically typed languages score are typically in the development due to fewer lines of code to write and and no compile wait times for the development often goes through much	
 book for game has a very good explanation of i was actually going to write an implementation if i do throw the code up code is it is too big to put so you can grab it signed but the server do anything followed the in the book for the most but i made everything much more object oriented than anything i have seen thus far for have a maze that consists of each tile has a location and an obstacle if there is no can use a pathfinder to find th shortest path between a given start and end you get a path back which includes the tiles you need to go through to get from the start to the can change the heuristic calculation by providing a different heuristiccalculator current one just checks to see if there is an obstacle or not and figures out the shortest number of tiles to go you could add weights to different obstacles for instance if you like the code is license under the so if you make changes and distribute the app you have to make the changes feel free to send bug to the email address in the license comment in each get around to commenting it after but i think it is pretty straight

 buffering a request is not really something you can can consider staggering a user request for data over a set of http parsing and processing each http request as it comes if the user wishes to request records 1 to the client could first request records 1 to parse and render then request records 101 to 200 and so the first 100 records would display relatively quickly after a short the next 100 records would so long as the second 100 records displays before the user has managed to deal with the first 100 records it should be the overall time to complete the request will be however the web app will appear more responsive and the perceived task completion time will be should also consider switching from xml to json if not just updating the innerhtml property of an element with display to the user the response to an ajax the response must first be parsed into a data structure and then the parse time for both xml and json is pretty much the the difference lies in the time required to traverse and read the resulting data functions for traversing and accessing the data within the dom of a parsed response are relatively browser dom api methods mask the complexity of what is involved in dom traversing and make a slow process look nice and data in javascript objects resulting from the parsing of a response is much traversing a javascript object is easily 2 to 3 times faster than traversing a dom tree for the same set of recent tests i carried out with firefox beta 2 using 10mb of source traversing the dom of an xml response took about 30 doing the same for a javascript object populated from the same original large data set took about 15

 c function prototype simply wants a pointer to a buffer and the size of the what it expects to see inside the buffer is the my assumption wild guess is that the bitmap bits in a bytearray guess this needs to be broken down into but i think the general idea is get the data from your into probably a byte allocate an unmanaged buffer to store the copy the byte array to the pass the buffer pointer to your c free the buffer when you are can allocate an unmanaged buffer using pnt you can copy your byte array because its unmanaged you will be responsible for freeing it when you are as if you have access to the c it would be much better to simply pass the bitmap handle

 can use the ole db provider and an ado connection openschema method to get schema information as a recordset is arguable better than a collection because it can be basic methodology is to use adschematables to get the base tables then use each to fetch adschemacolumns for is adschemaindexes is where you will find unique not sure wether these can be distinguished from unique also the names of foreign keys to plug into the adschemaforeignkeys rowset watch for the gotcha that jet allows a fk based on a nameless pk of validation rules and check constraints can be found in the adschematableconstraints using the table name in the openschema then use the name in the call to the adschemacheckconstraints filter for gotcha is a constraint named so best to escape the null characters form the remember that validation rules can be either or constraints are always so you may need to use the table name in the for adschematableconstraints is will be in anotehr gotcha is that the field is 255 characters so any validation constraint definition of more than 255 characters will have a null for access query objects based on select sql is you can use the view name in adschemacolumns to get the column are in being all other flavours of access query objects including parameterized select for the latter i prefer to replace the parameters syntax with create procedure in the boterh looking in the you find the parameters can be enumerated by using an adox catalog object to return an ado command command enumerate the collection for the for and for for and properties such as unicode compression you need to use another kind of for a long integer autonumber in can be found using an ado catalog object luck

 changes the element have the following problem explain it simplified because otherwise it would get too need to create an server control that is inherited from simple when the custom control it should dynamically create a associate an event handler to it will also be defined inside the server and add this button to the rendered the click event handler defined inside the server control does some job which for the moment already coded an example and that works in the constructor of the server control i create a new button give it an associate an event on the oninit of the server control i add the button to the panel controls my control inherits from and then everything gets this looks something like the class private button public mybutton new new protected void eventargs protected override void protected override void protected override void protected override void works quite the button gets rendered correctly and when i click on the appropriate handler inside this customer server control is invoked and now the problem however starts when i would like to add multiple instances of this server control to my page because all of my generated buttons will have the same id which results in a so what i tried is to associate a random number to the id of the it end up being or something this solves my problem with the multiple but results in the problem that my event handler when clicking on the button is no more called i guess this is due to the problem that my button always gets another id when entering in the constructor and so the appropriate callback event someone give me a suggestion how i could handle the is there some way for remembering the id of the button and as far as i know however this has to happen in the where the viewstate yet so storing the id in the viewstate server how to handle id of dynamic

 combination of coroutines and resource acquisition seems like it could have some unintended basic question is whether or not something like this with as for line in yield it can test deeper concern is that is supposed to be something an alternative to where you ensure that a resource is released at the end of the coroutines can suspend and resume execution from the so is the conflict if you open a file with both inside and outside a coroutine while the coroutine yet with as for line in yield open the filehandle inside the coroutine as then open it for line in print can we still use was going for file handle contention in the previous but since most oses allocate filehandles there will be no contention to for pointing out the example make too much my revised which shows a real deadlock with yield yield print the coroutine got the it safe to yield from within a block in python

 comment specifically on iphone sdk as covered under a forum for disclosed developers at but roger nolan is half right and half half right in that when any sdk is the examples and templates in that sdk are updated to exploit that the templates may specifically use the new apis in that and the code might plain just not work with earlier you can save project templates from earlier sdks and install them in a local directory for use with later versions of the project template format itself templates should be forwards and backwards but the of the templates is usually locked to the sdk version it ships with and nolan is half wrong about building against earlier os versions with later why the earlier sdk packages are provided with the later distributions not there just to make the downloads take you can deploy against older os versions with a newer sdk by setting the deployment target build is the minor detail in that you probably deploy production applications produced by a but once version n is officially you should be able to use its toolchain to build for

 company is looking to replace all websites in the group with a new system and similar with functionality being added in a future too big a job for me to do in a reasonable so we are going to be inviting tenders from currently in the process of defining the technical and intending to dictate that the selected system must have a strict doctype and must trigger standards mode almost standards in common or something to that effect have to allow almost standards mode to cater for done a bit of homework an all of this i want the spec to be limited by my after all but it surprise you all that found that is completely divided on what is good are plenty of people who advocate strict plenty of people who recommend strict served as ok with this some who recommend html5 restricted to still not sure if this is a good idea or but i see the but also a number people on other so who recommend just understand the reasoning for you may happen to want to temporarily use something that been and thus transitional seems but some people recommend xhtml transitional for new checking out other sites for design notice that many sites they have any doctype specified at will refer to a transitional we all know there is plenty of crap on the so perhaps i draw too many but checking out web design agencies that come there are an amazing proportion of them vast majority of i would are using xhtml so you necessarily have to be an expert to call yourself a web but the sheer volume of transitional layouts makes me most of the sites seem to be otherwise reasonably designed accessible having finally got to the is there some reason why such a large proportion of these agencies are opting for transitional am i missing something that i need to consider for my new i realise the purpose of the transitional dtd i was just suspicious that so many web developers are clinging on to deprecated i wonder if you guys are correct and the answer is simply that they are are too lazy to get their own website to or sticking with the default dtd of their preferred key for me is that to your responses so i seem to be missing out on some key reason to use a transitional regarding our cms project all the agencies thankfully seem to have their heads screwed on valid and is xhtml transitional so

 compilers are much better at doing straightforward like this across your entire code ensure that you are enabling your compiler by compiling your release version with the right optimization if you use visual you might want to experiment with favoring size over speed are a lot of cases where small code is code generation which enables the compiler to do and maybe even also need to remember that the vast bulk of your code matter from a performance perspective optimizing this code will have no user visible need to define your performance goals early on and measure frequently to make sure meeting when outside of your use tools such as profilers to determine where the hot spots are in your code and optimize another poster without measuring and understanding optimization at all its just random you have measured and determined that a particular function or loop is a there are two approaches to optimize optimize it at a higher level by reducing invocations of the costly this will usually lead to the most algorithm level improvements fall into this level an algorithm will a better should result in running the hotspot code calls cannot be then you should consider look at the actual machine code that the compiler is emitting and determine what it is doing that is the most costly if it turns out copying temporary objects is then consider prefix over if doing an unnecessary comparison at the beginning of the flip the loop into a and so without understanding the code is any blanket are next to

 compute a you have to traverse both trees you have to examine the properties of each node and perform the hash for if a is in the you have to iterate over its characters and do some then you have to combine the hash of the node with the hash of the computing a hash value for two structures is of the same order a little more as comparing them for equality one in because when performing an equality you can stop as soon as you detect any a single equality test is going to be much on is likely to be beneficial only if you cache the hash value and reuse it many and because hash values for different trees can you still need to have equality comparison

 contract types in a common assembly is a really good it gives you the chance to add for to convert between the contract types and other business objects you may or between those makes sense to use common types if you do not control all suppose you have a service that is consumed by internal apps that use and also by trusted third parties at a partner the partner apps use or or in this case the partner have access to the shared but relying on the can roll their own type that should not preclude you from providing a nice package of shared types to your recommendation to share types also applies when you use a rest interface as opposed to with wsdl is lacking but xsd would still be used to describe the types of the messages that the server and its clients so no change in advise regardless of whether you use soap or it applies whether you use or java or anything if you control both ends of the wire and the platforms are the then you should share why

 could simply store a reference to the frame but this is probably a bad this keeps the frames and also holds references to all the local variables so it may impact performance if they happen to be using large chunks of and could have even worse effects if relying on finalization to destroy resources like locks and filehandles when they go out of means need to hold a string representation of the stacktrace which is not ideal for your purposes to actually do some processing to get even though rarely there seem to be much way around though you could consider disabling it until you set some configuration that way get better performance for the common but could still enable the setting when trying to diagnose your calling function alone some small number of parent is enough to distinguish the route the trace is always the same when called via and no func2 vs to distinguish between you could maintain a hash based on filename and line number of the calling frame the last two calling frames however this probably match your and where it end up with bogus stack that if you do want the using is probably a better way to get

 created a set of javabean annotations working on a new version right so the trunk code match the update site them can be quite usually approach it by creating a project in eclipse with the test code and building then make a copy and turn off annotation can then use eclipse to compare the test project to the copy of the have too many test cases yet very tedious to generate so many combinations of but this is annotations in a build system is actually very take a look at for an example of how used in an ant and using it in eclipse is just a matter of making a plugin specifying the annotation processor extension and turning on annotation processing in projects that want to use used annotation processing in a continuous build building the annotations then using it in the rest of the really pretty found this to be an issue be careful of what you do in the i generate a lot of code in mine and it runs a little slower in that java6 processors can run a little faster because they are part of the normal compilation had trouble getting them to work properly in a code generation capacity think much of the problem is support and running for i stick with java is one of the things in the annotation the api has a object that handles all each ide provides an implementation that converts this into appropriate error messages at the right location in the only thing i did was to cast the processing environment object so i could check if it was bring run as a build or for editor if i eventually change this to just do error checking at edit time so it can report errors as you be though you need to keep it fast for use during reconciliation or editing gets generation a little more per annotation processor specifications state that you are not allowed to modify the class that contains the i suspect this is to simplify the processing rounds do not need to include the annotated preventing infinite update loops as generate other and they recommend that generate a superclass for all of the methods and anything else i need to i also have the processor verify that the annotated class extends the generated for class foo extends generate a class in the same package with the name of the annotated class plus and verify that the annotated class is declared to extend have seen someone use the compiler tree api to modify the annotated class this is against spec and i suspect plug that hole at some point so it would recommend generating a happy using annotation very well especially looking at build i would recommend sticking with the java5 annotation processors if doing code generation you need to run a separate tool called apt to process then do the that the api for java 5 and java 6 annotation processors is the java 6 processing api is better but i just had luck with java 6 processors doing what i need java 7 comes out give the new processing approach another free to email me if you have this

 current intranet environment is a little the current stack has applications that are querying against a sql 2000 role there are user groups on the servers that users are added into you need to be added into the group on the test and production these user groups are synchronized into user roles on sql 2000 roles are granted execute permissions to stored procedures as needed to prevent any access the web application we use basic authentication authenticates against our active and have identity impersonation turned the connection string to the database uses integrated this creates an environment where the web application connects to the database as the user logged which will enforce database security on stored procedures being it also allows us to use the typical method to perform authorization within the application are several problems with the first is that only our server administrators have access to the user groups on the so updating role or adding additional users is out of the hands of the application in the only way to get the role was to call a sql procedure called which is locked down in sql while i know the full our dba tells us that this general model play nice with sql 2005 given the nature of schemas in the newer at the point now that ready to update our writing apps to leverage more ajax and sql server 2005 is the primary environment for our looking to update the security model as well to be a bit more flexible for the application and potentially leverage active directory concern we have as well is that a given user will most likely have access to multiple so having some kind of centralized solution is optimal so we can easily remove users when is considered the best practice for maintaining role security in this kind of is the best practice for role security for an intratnet

 currently fighting with the viewstate and it is starting to wear me having found that some of the pages in one of our applications is made up of around viewstate i have looked into reducing this where i have looked at am happy disabling viewstate for controls that do not need it buttons and have made some small gains now looking at viewstate compression and while i can demonstrate a decrease in size it does not seem to be playing well with my contains a few dropdown a button and a grdiview the need to deal with the when the page loads the ddls are populated and default selections are pressing the ok button results in the gridview being populated as the with viewstate compression if the user changes the selected items in the ddls before clicking the ok button they will get a field error indicating that a selection has not been made in one of the ddls but this is not the disabling the compression code removes the problem and the page operates as expected as it has for the problem be down to the viewstate now being stored in a key other than code that i have seen use different key names vstate for page sources look like source with compression the empty source without does know where the viewstate is stored and does it know that i have moved i need to make any other changes to my code apart from implementing savepagestatetopersistencemedium and got to the bottom of this well i have it some reason using the method appears to have been the source of the modifying the code to utilise the base class save and processing the pair object returned by i now have a working test show a reduction of aroun on the test page so pretty happy with that i have compression working i need to recommend that the next code review has a focus on removing viewstate where it is not to eveyone who responded to my cry for help saved me a few grey hairs compression issues

 decent sized project to be really successful over the long term needs to perform the steps you but not necessarily in the manner described that you must do look at happening in the market and a huge trend of moving towards as well as test driven these more and tie everything together as a natural part of every project members daily working my personal experience is that having a in a document somewhere means that someone has to maintain one mistake and the trail starts to become you end up with process descriptions which are a list of which inevitably become impossible to piece back is where a is documents are actually linked to via a from which they are checked in and out there are approval in the system along with audit tests are written and automated as much as running of the tests is tracked and even if there are processes for test escapes to make there way back into the process from the requirements code is built against tests and escapes the source code management system is tied to this central repository and no change to the code is unless it can be linked is full end to end traceability through the the systems are structured so that people interacting with it will find it easier to do their jobs and have less to worry many companies used atlassian subversion hooks to fisheye and cruise control to provide these these systems are far from perfect but much much better than the riduculous manual process of someone responsible for maintain a table in every one of 2000 even microsoft project implemented can be used to do this today and provide a single site where all come together for about is that cost even on a small

 depends on the type of web applications can continue running even after exceptions have bubbled up to the execution is common practice to an exception if you catch the exception at a level where it be dealt you would almost always add context to the at the very least add some logging at the higher level to say that it was caught and example calls b calls c this you would want b to add some logging so that you can differentiate between b generating and throwing an and c generating and throwing an that would allow you a greater ability to debug and fix problems general you will almost never want an exception to kill your the best practice is to catch the except and exit this allows you to save any currently open information and release resources that are being used so they become if you intend to you can create your own information report that includes the things you were doing when you caught the fatal you let the exception kill your process you are eliminating your chance to get custom tailored crash and you are also skipping the part where you provide the user with a friendly error message and then i would recommend always catching and never voluntarily letting them run amok in your you are writing a you have to choose ahead of time whether your function will throw an or be exception in those sometimes you will throw an exception and have no idea if the calling party will catch but in that catching it is not your as long as the api declares that the function could throw looking for a word that means possibly throw anyone know what it going to bug me all

 depends on what you want to serialize of in some cases serialization is ridicilously once wrote kind of a timeline program in you could draw en drag around and resize if you were ready you could save it in file on that momenet hundreds of objects where their position on the their their their their special could than ofcourse open and work this only asked a lines of made all classes and their dependencies and my coding time took less than 5 i was astonished was the first time i used serialization on a timeline you could also for different versions and the files where very easy to backup and think in my particular case it would be a bit idiot to use but of course for structures like word to name point thus first are certainly several scenarios in which databases be the best serialization was not invented by developers just because they were true if you use xmlserialization or quite relevant if you are not plenty of for if you want it to be see 1 course serialization has besides the speed of implementation other important advantages like not needing a database at all in some

 depends on why you need to add if it is always going to be then oninit is a good you need to add it only after an action has occured then you want to do it after loadviewstate has been called so you can continue to add it once you add it the first for the first time most likely you will want to do it because of some post back so you could add it in your event would suggest adding a placeholder to the control at the location of where you will want this then you add the control when it is you should then store some information in viewstate to know that you added the you can then override and add the control there if it is you need the validator only if the control is loaded with some then you add it right after the data has been be that onload or some property

 depends upon how much you believe in that software basically is it going to solve your problems more efficiently than your current software so when was first we embraced it immediately we thought its a huge improvement over not so for now if we do decide to adopt preview software below are my answers for your 3 your first point the kind of advancements you got these days with ides there is very little risk as far as code breaking with the final version is and these companies do a very good job about informing well in advance about the greater risk is about whether that technology is going to be adopted by the would your client be willing to shell out that extra buck for your second point if we feel strongly about a new then the moment it is we start researching on it to have that extra your third point if the software is a problem solver at an affordable cost then you have hit jackpot as an early you can charge more for those skills as obviously there would be less supply and more if the software is not embraced by the masses your time and money invested goes down the drain

 design in latex has not been made very i would use rather than and draw the lines manually to keep things a downside is that you get any automatic sizing of the table but since your format is i would consider it a good thing if text you notice it and get to fix it and your table accidentally get stretched into the if you use multiple tables like this in your try packaging the commands with how high to draw the lines of the how thick lines to how much to indent each first set the tab then draw the now start the indent the first column with and each additional column with end each line with add to get 2pt extra space if another be careful not to overflow the table no automatic check for also remember to start a new page after the change the fixed see or possibly if you are using

 designing a very simple terms of but difficult terms of system where users can message each think of it as a very simple chatting a user can insert a message through a php the message is short and has a recipient another php the user can view all the messages that were sent to him all at once and then deletes them on the all the functionality needed for this how should i go about designing this a point of far i have the table like message recipient for sql i find that the time it takes is constant regardless of number of rows in the so my will have a guaranteed return time which is for pulling down my will take longer as the number of rows i find the sql select will take longer as the rows grow and this is true even after i have an index for the recipient if it was simply the case that users will have to wait a longer time before their messages are pulled on the php then it would have been but what i am worried is that when each service time takes really the php server will start to refuse connections to some or worse the server might just the question how to design this such that it any some estiamte on of users starts with and goes user on average have around 10 messages stored before the other end might pull it user sends around messages a from reading the answers so just want to clarify that by pulling down less messages from does not even just pull one message will take a long time when the table is this is because the table has all the messages so you have to do a select like message from db where recipient if you change it to this it help top 1 message from db where recipient far from the answers it seems like the longer the table the slower the select will be or slightly no way around if that is the how should i handle this from the php i want the php page to fail on the http because the user will be confused and end up refreshing like mad which makes it even some suggestion for a database schema

 developing a dynamic html window absolute positioned using jquery that automatically centers itself on the it can also accommodate content that fits or exceeds the dimensions of the window idea is that our customer clicks a link next to our product listing and then this window comes up and displays its sales each sales letter also contains a video that further describes the window will remain at the center of the screen until it is dismissed by either clicking the close button in the window or clicking outside of it remains in the center by adjusting its absolute positioning based upon where the user scrolls and if they resize the problem is in the video in all other browsers except firefox all the video is rendered perfectly within the window as the user scrolls around the document or resizes the in when the user and the window adjusts its absolute positioning the video looks like it smudges from where it was originally to where it is now or the video screen goes thought maybe what needed to be done is force firefox to redraw the video i tried a few different ways to accomplish simply making the element disappear and reappear quickly seem to do the if i quickly adjusted its margins or position back and it seemed to i was going to go with this but as i began to test it across other this motion seemed to slow down the specifically i noticed it in chrome tested it on the other browsers thought about limiting this fix to but the browser data field in jquery was deprecated in i could always make the javascript myself to identify the but i was wondering if there was a better way to go about forcing the browser to redraw the video or maybe on the wrong track and it need to be using firefox chrome internet explorer 7 and safari input would be appreciated the code for the wigglevids i changed the code so that way embeded elements are wiggled only when the popup position has instead of binding it to the window scroll this has sped up execution a but its still not there quite its still a noticeable following i changed the code so that the embeded videos in the popup window are stored in an this when this function gets executed the browser have to search the dom again and again for the embeded myvids is globally declared and cleared when the popup if 0 if 0 var ctr ctr var myobj var temp var suffix var currentmargin suffix suffix 2 temp var newmargin currentmargin newmargin currentmargin 1 do i force firefox to redraw a video

 did five years of work and then switched to and found i disliked most of the ides as especially which imho is a royal pain and is only popular because some people have been using for it for finally tried intellij and decided to buy there are a lot of things i could fault with with larger it spends what feels like hours analyzing code on and when it detects a change can happen under certain cirumstances when you clean your during this time you use the it also would crash for a period of a although after sending five different stack dumps to jetbrains the issue was finally fixed in a new compared to willing to work with the issues i had with eclipse never seemed as large as the few had with but they were always annoying and took a lot of time to tweak and there also seemed to be a lot of happening all the and it made me feel like the ide was never it seemed far too easy to screw up the work environment and make eclipse simply not this is all subjective of but other members of my team had similar we could never quite blame eclipse flat out for not yet we seeemed to have to spend about a day or so every couple of months totally reinstalling it because the delicate balance of plugins was somehow disrupted and the thing would just not work how we wanted it members of my team use net beans only played with a so i put it in i prefer there are a lot of really neat tools included with and the editor has these which detect what kind of project working on if it uses gwt or and can detect a lot of mistakes that normally discovered until runtime and notify you in the ide with installing plugins is a intellij looks the most like visual studio of any of the java the way it organizes project files is also somewhat similar with analogous concepts to solution and project files compared to eclipse or netbeans i also think it has the nicest key bindings of any ide ever

 did what arno setagaya suggested in his made some sample tests and compared the compression tests were done using 5 each of them 4096 bytes in each byte inside of these 5 files was generated in real the data would not likely be all but would tend to have quiet a bit of repeating thus in real life application the compression would tend to be a bit better then the following each of the 5 files was compressed by itself not together with the other 4 which would result in better in the following results i just use the sum of the size of the 5 files together for included rar just for comparison even though it is not open best to 20775 20480 100 of original 20825 20480 100 of original 20827 20480 100 of original 21020 20480 100 of original 22899 20480 100 of original to my surprise all of the tested algorithms produced a larger size then the i guess they are only good for compressing larger or files that have a lot of repeating bytes random data like the thus i will not be using any type of compression on my tcp maybe this information will be useful to others who consider compressing small pieces of forgot to mention that i used default options for each of the

 differences can seem but they are not every language makes the same but in a makes the type and name of the variable known to the allocates storage and specifies an initial value for the can combine a variable declaration and definition into one as is commonly x a variable inside a function will also set aside memory for the so the following code implicitly defines variable as a part of its int return variable is automatically defined by the it will contain whatever value was in the memory location that was allocated for this is why it is not safe to use automatic variables until explicitly assigned a known value to takes place any time you change the value of a variable in your similar to the variable makes the function signature known to the this allows you to call a function in your source code before it is defined without causing a compiler specifies the return parameter and instructions for a the first three of these elements must match the function a function must only be defined once in a given x 0 x return can combine the function decalartion and definition into but you must do so before the function is called anywhere in your the the

 do i set up a git project to contains other i am working on an online mapping we developed a gps tool together with an outfit in we simultaneously developed a python geomapping script together with a different concern only cares about our own core files unite the and build upon them for the app we of the projects must exist by itself the folks that have interest in the gps only have interest in gps but the project which includes all of the others must be accessible as a spent some time trying to understand but they appear to have too much independence for what is if it would be nice if each of those projects could contain one or two overlapping could one git project include a file that is not part of its so that when this file is updated by either team both can this doable with with does the host have the idea of using subversion for the ignoring the and using git for the projects but that is only a last explain why i want users the zip does not include the submodules when even collaborators try to setup the this is a show are frozen they do not pick up the latest version of the project that is being pointed reasons as pointed out in the fantastic answers below and in this at to me by will not it is difficult to update the source a from within the project it is merged and that source must reside outside of the folder of the being a web it is vital that all my pages link internally to a folder within and that testing and updates be done directly within that this is clear and useful to studying setting up but other ideas are still within projects using

 do most of my work with microsoft technologies these so naturally checking out what wcf has to it seems very flexible and a great next step up from but it seems very tied to soap messages and quite a bit clunky for a platform agnostic web service not an expert on the but i imagine all of this flexibility touting means that you can break away from soap messages and return whatever data you is this true or reason i say this is that if i really wanted to create an application as a rest one of my target platforms would be not just one important goal of any web based service is to keep the data payload small whether for a mobile at dial up speeds or a full desktop if you take api as an it has been incredibly successful because you can request the data as json with no fancy soap envelopes weighing the data down and receive the smallest amount of bytes to represent the data you so a mobile application running on a device with poor connectivity consuming data can use the least amount of bandwidth besides the pattern of or any of the more successful public is a custom data structure in json xml and not wrapped in a soap envelope i could be is just my would you do this in do you have to jump through hoops to tell wcf to return this worry about the soap or is it a simple config as a web service with the smallest possible

 do this for any object in javascript will not be simple or you will run into the problem of erroneously picking up attributes from the prototype that should be left in the prototype and not copied to the new for you are adding a method to as some answers you will need to explicitly skip that but what if there are other additional methods added to or other intermediate that you know in that you will copy attributes you so you need to detect attributes with the addition to encounter a tougher problem when you try to copy objects that have hidden for is a hidden property of a an prototype is referenced with the attribute which is also and will not be copied by a loop iterating over the source i think might be specific to javascript interpreter and it may be something different in other but you get the not everything is you can copy a hidden attribute if you know its but i know of any way to discover it another snag in the quest for an elegant solution is the problem of setting up the prototype inheritance if your source prototype is then simply creating a new general object with will but if the prototype is some descendant of then you are going to be missing the additional members from that prototype which you skipped using the or which were in the but enumerable in the first one solution might be to call the source property to get the initial copy object and then copy over the but then you still will not get for a object stores its data as a hidden if obj typeof return var copy for attr in if return d1 new wait for 5 start start d2 date string for d1 will be 5 seconds behind that of a way to make one date the same as another is by calling the but that is specific to the date i think there is a general solution to this though i would be happy to be i had to implement general deep copying i ended up compromising by assuming that i would only need to copy a plain or the last 3 types are so i could perform a shallow copy and not worry about it i further assumed that any elements contained in object or array would also be one of the 6 simple types in that this can be accomplished with code like the handle the 3 simple and null or if obj typeof return handle if instanceof var copy new return handle if instanceof var copy for i len i return handle if instanceof var copy for attr in if return throw new to copy its type above function will work adequately for the 6 simple types i as long as the data in the objects and arrays form a tree that there more than one reference to the same data in the for this would be tree 3 this would but you would get 2 copies of the inner node instead of 2 references to the same directedacylicgraph 3 cloning this would cause a stack overflow due to infinite cylicgraph 3 will not be able to handle any javascript but it may be sufficient for many purposes as long as you assume that it will just work for anything you throw at

 domain model is indispensable in most it gives the technical staff a clear and unambiguous understanding of the domain a uml class diagram is the best notation for this even better than an english language use case model not is much easier to manipulate than a dozen word documents on your choice of uml of and so recommend you follow the uml route in documenting your use your uml tool will almost certainly allow you to assign additional information to your use such as test metrics having this in a model will allow you to create custom reports on this extra say that if you need a state use a uml state if you need a flow use a uml activity if you need a call use a uml sequence in each the uml notation is going to be more widely understood than whatever ad hoc notation you invent on your the general message to use whatever tools you have at hand to make your job	
 done a fair amount of work on mvc on the and learning about it in my oop seeing some and i tell whether because the version of the mvc pattern is different than the traditional or whether i misunderstood my the model flat is a generic the view is what the user interacts and the controller mediates between the users actions and the the controller is the most and it manages the tells the model what it and tells the views what to we have the views matching what i just the model contains a list of the views so that it can update them when the data and the controller simply maps the actions to calls to the model and to specific objects may ask the model to update the what ends up happening is that most of the business logic is in the and tied very heavily to the simulation or application that is being while the controller is reduced to a mapping tool between commands and are your thoughts on the version of mvc different than traditional	
 done in the past as cleanly as possible write the minimum amount of code that interacts with version dependent aspects of the have a version of this code for each version of the have them all implement the same the bulk of your application should try to and possibly a reflection for dynamically load the version suitable for the latest if that fall back to a statically linked version for the old appropriate use of sourcepath and you can arrange for your core code to be prevented from using the new	
 done in the past with these sort of projects is rather then try and document in do the one or two high level these to a and link to any other documentation that a section for or known a list of a list of off you gives people a one stop shop of what is going on in a and how to resolve any current would think sharepoint is too complicated for although you could use sharepoint to do is easily good enough for	
 done that back in 2000 my first windows program ever was a hook i did was implementing the filter hook driver and writing a userspace application that prepared a filter table on what to allow and what to when you get around your initial set of blue screens below for my debug tip in kernel the filter mode driver is quite easy to use it gives each packet to a function you wrote and depending on the return code drops it or lets it packets at that level are quite fragments are not reassembled and it looks more like the end of things no ethernet headers so have quite a bad time decoding the packets to filter with that also is the firewall hook as discussed in this you are on vista or server 2008 better have a look at wfp filtering that seems to be the mandated api of the day for writing know about it other than google turing it up some minutes ago when i googled for the filter hook forgot the debug dbgview shows dbgprint and more important it can also read them from the dump file your last blue screen so sprinkle your code with dbgprint and if it bluescreens just load the dump into dbgview to see what happened before it died very using this i managed without having a kernel	
 done this in a few but from memory office addins get like files in the right com object which represents your registry entries under to tell office to load your com my thinking is the problem will be that you need to register the com registering com objects is a action and hence requires admin be able to see if this is indeed your registry key under the office addins one will be called something like you can then search under for and it should be present when you run the install as and present when running as it is you can get around it by doing a registration of the com but this is a bit may be easier these but when i had to do you used a utility called to capture the registry entries associated with the com object into a then modify the file with a text editor to replace with then instead of registering the com you load this

 dotnetopenauth 3 in mvc and implementing a rememberme facility finding that even if i set createpersistentcookie to true in and the user is not remembered the session times i inspect the cookie i find it is marked as persistent and does have an expiry date way in the i assume because i set my forms timeout to a few years if the user closes the browser and it they are remembered correctly as long as the asp session timed older of scott makes me wonder if it is because formsauthentication tries to renew the authentication ticket and maybe in an openid model that work but i have set forms in and anyway i thought that forcing a persistent cookie would make that stuff also wondering why the dotnetopenid mvc sample include a rememberme checkbox maybe something tricky about the other here at stackoverflow i see i am automatically remembered across wondering whether they used something other than dotnetopenid to do their openid else done rememberme successfully with dotnetopenid in any for trying to turns out this was not about after reading that my hosting provider is probably recycling the app pool regularly and causing the authentication ticket encryption to be done with a new machine per the preceding linked article i added the following under in my and it resolved the a new key to place a new key to place with dotnetopenid in	
 doubt a controversial and definitely a personal i like of the smalltalkers that run into on the net try to say how smalltalk is basically the best thing since sliced and how awful every other language saying that smalltalkers act that way but been a very noticeable trend in the ones very clearly been looking down on anyone who use simply not a good way of persuading people to use a it puts me off because i enjoy learning with a and i really want to be part of a community which looks down on me even if just a vocal minority taking that know enough about smalltalk to comment on it at all and really like to learn it but lower down the list of languages for me to learn than others where had a more positive experience with the nearly had the same problem for due to someone taking that attitude in the but fortunately more engaging personalities have the fact that people like it so much suggests there are good things about it as a technology but a human being rather than a technical merit is only part of the just alone on but in if you want to show someone how awesome your favourite thing and maybe persuade them that should use it starting off by rubbishing their current tool is a bad operating system zealots all should take

 each item so random lookup is extremely fast i can instantly say want the 657415671567th and go straight to because we know its memory address will be exactly 657415671567 bigger than the first this has little or no memory overhead in it has no way of automatically resizing you have to create a new copy across all the and then delete the old plain lists are useful when you need to lookup data from anywhere in the and you know that your list will not be longer than a certain item has a reference to the next this means that there is some overhead store the reference to the next because not stored you immediately go to the 657415671567th element you have to start at the head and then get its reference to go to the and then get its to get to the and then get its reference to get to the and then get its reference to get to the in this it is very inefficient for random it allows you to modify the length of the if your task is to go through each item then about the same value as a plain if you need to change the length of the it could be better than a plain if you know the 566th and looking for the then all you need to do is follow the reference to the next if you know the 567th and looking for the the only way to find it is to start searching from the 1st element this is where double linked lists come in linked linked lists store a reference to the previous this means you can traverse the list as well as this could be very useful in some situations as the example given in the linked list other than they have most of the same advantages and disadvantages as a linked from comments use as a have to take all of those advantages and disadvantages into can you say with confidence that your queue will have a maximum if your queue could be anywhere from 1 to 10000000000 elements then a plain list will just waste memory then may not even be big in that go with a linked rather than storing the of the front and you should actually store the a linked list is made up of and each node stores the item as well as the reference to the next you should store a reference to the first and the last when you you stick a new node onto the rear linking the old rear one to the new rear and remember this new rear when you you remove the front and remember the second one as the new that you have to worry about any of the middle you can thus ignore the length of the queue you can store that too if you really

 easiest way to do this is probably by storing the object in the viewstate when the page loads the first having the user manipulate and then saving it back to the database when the user wants to save one of the problems with this approach is that if multiple users edit the same item at the same you could end up with a situation where data is user a loads page and starts making user b loads page and starts making user a presses changes are saved to user b presses changes are saved to overwriting user could get around this by using a timestamp to save the date and time of the last and comparing it to the one in the viewstate before committing the you could lock the item when someone begins editing stopping two people from making changes at the same though this solution is probably less reliable what happens if the user browses away from the page while

 embedded it is often necessary to access fixed memory locations for peripheral the standard way i have found to do this is something like the access register which is located at address write to x read from understand how that but what i understand is how the space for is allocated what keeps the linker from putting another variable at can the space be reserved at the c or does there have to be a linker option that specifies that nothing should be located at using the gnu tools so am mostly interested in the specifics of that toolset at the additional information about my architecture to clarify the processor interfaces to an fpga via a set of registers mapped into the regular data space variables of the so i need to point to those registers and block off the associated address in the i have used a compiler that had an extension for locating variables from c i would group the registers into a then place the struct at the appropriate byte byte regs creating a struct reserves the space in the using the gnu i obviously have the using the pointer reg1 reg2 regs is a simple application with no os and no advanced memory address variable in

 enum is can avoid casting from your type and constrain the values that can be explicitly cast to your type by making a sealed and providing conversion an implicit operator for converting from your type to a generic int so you have to an explicit operator for converting from an int to your which throws an error if the integer fails to meet the such as 0 x using this create a generic immutable base class such as which has a constructor that accepts a t value and delegate for the bool the constructor should run the value through the constraint and throw an exception if it fails to meet the the base class should also take care of the implicit conversion operation to and should handle equality by overloading and defining and operators for the type and implementing and i also recommend defining an copy constructor for the base and all derived cloning can then be implemented cleanly in the base class by retrieving the copy constructor via but this is entirely you can figure out the implementation unless already posted it on stackoverflow can provide named static readonly values in your derived so that you can access them just like an sealed class public static readonly constraint 0 x public static readonly returnvalue success new public static readonly returnvalue failreason1 new public static readonly returnvalue failreason2 new private int value constraint private returnvalue original base be used to support iclonable implementation in base public static explicit operator int value to return an existing instance is more efficient than creating a new one and the constraint when there is a limited number of allowed if the constraint was more such as an even then you would instead return a new instance and make your constructors case return case return case return throw new fails to meet the constraint defined for could use this technique for any for a class called evennumber may have a constraint that returns true if the given number is in that just make your constructors and simplify your static conversion operator to just return a new instead of switching to return one of the limited existing could be used like x y exception fails to meet the constraint defined for a enum would stupidly allow such a creating an invalid breaking the z no cast

 even simpler than hashtable is nothing more than an array of vectors which contain the maximum size of this array is typically smaller than the number of items in the set of possible values for the type of data being stored in the hash algorithm is used to generate an index into that array based on the values of the item that will be stored in the is where storing vectors of pairs in the array come because the set of values that can be indexes in the array is typically smaller than the number of all possible values that the type can it is possible that your hash algorithm is going to generate the same value for two separate a hash algorithm will prevent this as much as possible is why it is relegated to the type usually because it has specific information which a general hash algorithm possibly but impossible to of you can have multiple keys that will generate the same hash when that the items in the vector are iterated and a direct comparison is done between the key in the vector and the key that is being looked if it is great and the value associated with the key is nothing is

 even worse than yuval given a vector x you are looking for a new vector is the which you are probably thinking of as a euclidean norm with are floating point so not enough to just guard against dividing by you also have a floating point issue if the are all small may underflow and you lose the what it all boils down to is that if you really need to be able to handle small vectors have to do some more small and zero vectors make sense in your you can test against the magnitude of the vector and do something that as soon as you start dealing with floating rather than doing things like squaring and then square rooting numbers sums of is problematic at both the large an small ends of the representable doing numerical work correctly over all cases is trickier than it first off the top of my head potential problems with this operation done in a naive components too single component too large square root of max will return this cuts the available magnitudes componentwise by sqrt the ratio of a large component to a small component is too you can effectively lose the small components direction if you

 expand on read or write a it would take a major stroke of luck to get anything reasonable out of doing it and in the real world when not just running your program again the odds of success go from infinitesimal to you need to read and write what the pointer points that any string whose length named in the declaration is a pointer unless running in the compatibility mode that makes into mode exists only for compatibility with very old code that was written when this was the only strings we you appear to be simply writing the whole thing out no reason to be playing games with fixed size simply write each field to a write the length of a string before writing the string itself so you can load it back in the file will be smaller and nothing gets as he use the old format has uses for a file of records that is left on no reason to use it in a case like

 expressions are definitely the first place most start out they really cope with many edge cases that one meets in most languages text that looks like keywords can be in found string string literals in turn can contain escaped as well as special same thing goes for to do a good job of syntax highlighting you need to perform lexing of the source parsing it with the application of heuristics to build a list of where each region of the source is annotated with how it is to be edits take you can again apply language rules to see how far this change can alter the presentation of a for example typing a letter inside a string literal simply makes the string literal region but typing a closing quote truncates the region and turns the leftover part of it into subject to all the other lexing

 far as i can you are looking for the storage part of a data warehouse system here reports would be the the way commercial systems are doing is the cache you preaggregate your tables and create caches of the only way to accelerate your queries is to make the database system do less for this means less which in turn means less time spent in iterating the data or less data in the i would either propose the cache there really more than 24 you should be able to trivially parallelize the sorting queue by creating copies of the way to do would be to cache at hour granularity and then aggregate the hours into days 30 minutes if your timezones require this means you cache at a finer granularity than your daily cache but at a coarser granularity than the original

 feel fortunate that i have been given an opportunity to improve code practices in my office by starting to implement some internal code reviews which could start out as some simple i need suggestions on tools and general went to school for softe and understand the process of classic software i then worked at a big company making operating systems where we spared no cost reviewing code and looking for i was on a very good team and used diff and participated in the mindset of scrutinizing code as a i work in a nearly opposite office that makes web pages and no one reviews we even have cvs setup it was one blue moon ago before i got we recently got hacked and defaced on one of our minor servers due to some insecure code that allowed unrestricted file because of my experience charged with coming up with the new review process which the boss likes because we can still bill for that time and he now sees that we need to do so i want to lose this opportunity because as much as i like the lack of structure we really could benefit from main question is what kind of tool would be good for putting up an internal review checklist for we could build our own but reusing a tool is obviously someone suggested i looked at it my main problem is web sites are not or even they could have problems in the even the js can reveal security and these things are all interconnected like a hard to break up and i see one monolithic security checklist cutting i have been breaking it up based on each piece that interacts with another and coming up with the short list for that such as when going from php into a remember to validate and escape from php to list sensitive details in hidden fields or functions on the client that kind of have to ultimately build something that integrates all the aspects of web for now focusing on security in the form of code i have to break it up by conceptual task because everyone will use it and some of us some just barely do some others are and we each have different things that need to be especially between sysadmins and php code review tool for web both for security and

 feel that the mvc pattern as a framework for data driving web applications does seems to require less verbosity and hence less code with dynamic languages like python and which is a good languages make it easy to avoid the dependency between the v and c which is one of the purposes of the for example in python you can just pass your model objects to the view without the view requiring a dependency on the model it just cares that any type with the same attributes is passed once you start using a templating language in the like in it even cause script errors when an attribute avoid these dependency in a strongly typed you often start passing passing around dictionaries with literal strings as meaning most of the benefits of strongly type languages are lost your compiler tell you named a key and then attempt to find it with a key this will be discovered at given the mvc pattern lends itself to testing by allowing the v and c to be tested there is less advantage using strongly typed compiled language as tests can be used to validate your application is working as it should

 find a clear answer to this question with all my i want a web is there a library in java that takes advantage of the hardware accelerated graphics drivers on the as in opengl and picturing writing some driver detection code before the applet launches to detect 3d graphics realize there are a lot of java 3d libraries but figure this was under the impression that you could do but find how about flash and i thought all their 3d graphics are software see the answer to the question is java does have 3d hardware thanks for all the guess my real question is getting to what extent is this supported for full can you use directx or opengl for i might expect some features to be missing as that tend to abstract things could i make a gpuid program or a utility that the gpu capabilities in is it could i port an old 3d game like quake to a java applet and have decent on client system of applets with hardware accelerated 3d opengl

 first part of your question has already been answered by no form of inheritance takes the vector behaves as a and nothing are two ways to manipulate the first one is through a for like you i you should use since that is the type returned by cout iterating through the elements contained in the so printing make there is only one cout to access the element contained in the cout is other approach is to use the algorithms defined in the standard as an introduction to going to split it up into a few every container also defines an iterator iterators are conceptually like pointers that point to a location in the so instead of you can call on the element point to by any given an iterator called the syntax would be reason for this is that it allows a common and generic way to traverse because deques and all other container types all provide and these iterators use the same your code can take a pair of denoting the beginning and the end of the range of elements you want to and then the same code will work regardless of the underlying container use a loop to run through the container but this time using current current cout cout is a huge improvement so although it does eliminate the index which often except as a loop the functions return an iterator pointing to the first element in the and another pointing past the of the so as we move the first iterator we know reached the end when it equals the end in this two iterators can represent any range of that we have iterators we can use a lot of other the standard library comes with a number of algorithms for processing sequences of located in the simple one to get us started is which is almost a replacement for a for it is simply a function which takes two denoting the range of elements it should and an action it should perform on so to call we need to define such an cout cout is a function which takes the element type as a and does whatever needs to be now we can call you need to do this it saves a lot of the print function only has to be defined and then every for loop can be replaced with such a nice trick with iterators is that they have to represent the entire we could skip the first five take only the first three any other manipulation you can think are also algorithms such as copy from one iterator range to may be any type of iterator as it have to be a vector iterator just because the source in fact we could even copy directly to if you wanted to print out the contents directly since myclass define the that would result in an work around this little problem with we could use which applies some transformation to each and then places the result into an output since we directly print out a myclass we could just transform it to a which be printed return is fairly simple we simply create a function which takes a myclass and builds a string with the desired so copy this directly to creates a special output stream iterator out of to allow it to function as an and once the actual this on everything in the code became a single the actual action to perform is defined so it have to clutter up the while a for loop is the immediately obvious way to process sequences of elements in a iterators are often a better solution in the long they offer a lot more and even simplifies your code quite a blame you if you prefer to stick with for loops for as a bit easier to i simply wanted to show you that not the answer in	
 first query you provided is i really doubt that adding the column you were speaking of would give you any more since the not null property of every entry is checked since every comparison to null yields so i would guess that is expanded to is not null and maybe someone else can clarify other optimizations i can think of would involve precalculation or you can create tables matching certain rules or add further columns holding matching	
 first question would be what are you keeping in the can you move it to a we keep every config setting in a table in our database and use the to store the db connection sure how much of a rewrite that would be for but it would avoid your option would be to house your configuration items in an external file and reference it from the changes to that file would not be until the aspnet wp was recycled but would allow you to change setting and then cycle each server via an

 first thing to remember is that there are only 14 possible patterns of days in a two for each day of the week for leap one for second thing to remember is that the first 364 days of the year are because thats a multiple of 7 thus there are 5 x 52 260 weekdays in the first 364 days you only care about the last can both be weekdays so the answer to the question is you want a fast algorithm to work out the number of weekdays in any given you just need to come up with a formula that turns a year into the right year this be too hard given that leap years are

 firstly worth clarifying do you mean in the classical comp sci data structures sense a linked or do you mean if you mean a an if you want to use an array just use the arraylist implementation and get behaviour and problem you mean an array vs a linked a slightly different argument for which we go back to big o is a english if this is an unfamiliar you choose whichever one best suits how you resize your if you insert and delete a lot then maybe a linked list is a better same goes for if random access is you mention serial if mainly doing serial access with very little modification then it probably matter which you lists have a slightly higher overhead like you dealing with potentially blocks of memory and pointers to the next probably not an important factor unless dealing with millions of entries

 found to the question on jguru written by terence who created i copied this explanation from the site linked syntax directed translations can be done with actions within the these kinds of translations can only spit out constructs that are functions of information already seen at that point in the tree parsers allow you to walk an intermediate form and manipulate that gradually morphing it over several translation phases to a final form that can be easily printed back out as the new a simple translation problem where you want to print out an html page whose title is are n where n is the number of identifiers you found in the input the ids must be printed after the title like are 3 with simple actions in your grammar how can you compute the you without reading the whole so now we know we need an intermediate the best is usually an ast found since it records the input in this just a list but it demonstrates my now you know that a tree is a good thing for anything but simple given an how do you get output from imagine simple expression one way is to make the nodes in the tree specific classes like integernode and so then you just ask each node to print itself for you would have plusnode extends commonast public string ast left ast right return left intnode extends commonast public string return an expression you can translate it back to text with wrong with seems to work it appears to work well in this case because but i argue even for this simple tree grammars are more readable and are formalized descriptions of precisely what you coded in the returns string that the specific class approach actually encodes a complete parser for int by hand in as parser generator this should make you main weakness of the heterogeneous ast approach is that it cannot conveniently access context in a your context is easily accessed because it can be passed in as a you also know precisely which rule can invoke which other rule is this expression a while condition or an if by looking at the the plusnode class above exists in a isolated world where it has no idea who will invoke the programmer cannot tell in which context it will be invoked by reading adding actions to your input parser works for very straightforward translations order of output constructs is the same as the input constructs can be generated from information parsed up to the point when you need to spit them out you will need an intermediate ast is the best form using a grammar to describe the structure of the ast is analogous to using a grammar to parse your input formalized descriptions in a language like antlr are better than hand coded actions within a tree grammar have very clear context and can conveniently access information passed from invoking translations that manipulate the tree for multipass translations are also much easier using a tree

 from data access a major factor in code is data less data means more of it fits into the is mainly a factor with data wisdom says data structures must be aligned at word boundaries because the cpu can only access entire and if a word contains more than one you have to do extra work instead of a simple but caches can completely invalidate this a java boolean array uses an entire byte for each value in order to allow operating on individual values you can reduce the data size by a factor of 8 if you use actual but then access to individual values becomes much more requiring bit shift and mask operations class does this for due to cache this can still be considerably faster than using a when the array is iirc i once achieved a speedup by a factor of 2 or 3 this

 functions like usually get a character from the keyboard or standard they are sometimes used at the end of programs like do many know what the e stands for in are then used to give the user the change to see the output of the before the terminal windows closes that happens in note that there is a portable function called in c and that does also do that job for an enter in but that cause a harm it is not used to terminate the after a key is control continues and then after main the program and recent c versions insert a implicitly after the last statement of the main function stands for this means your main function returns a value of back to the but you can return other values if you write the return explicitly and put another value that value is what it terminates your and returns the given value back to the some other stuff never program will return a value of 42 to the normally you just there and it has the same effect not if you have local the destructor of those are not called if you use but they are cleanly destructed and destructors are called when you use prefer in main when you exit called in other functions than your main will terminate your program so it can be required to use that because return there will just return from those specific functions and do not at all terminate the

 goes like are but users will give you processing time in their browsers for code is relatively expensive compared to code on any site big enough to need to run more than one there are some things like data validation and retrieval that you leave to the like to do them on the because it means faster response times for the users and less server infrastructure for but security and accessibility concerns mean that code is typically happens is that you do you write your server side logic because you have but you also write the same logic in javascript in the hopes of providing faster responses to the user and saving your servers a little extra work in some since all programmers here we should immediately spot the new not only the extra work involved in developing two sets of the same but also the work involved in maintaining the bugs that inevitably result because the platforms match up and the bugs introduced as the implementations drift apart a little over the idea is that you can write code so that the same code runs on both the server and the this would appear to solve most of the you get the full set of both server and client logic done all at no no double also nice when your developers only need to know one language for both server and client in the real world it work out so the problem is server view of a page is just too different from the client view of a the server needs to be able to do things like talk directly to a database that just be done from the the browser needs to do things like manipulate a dom that match up with control the javascript engine of the meaning there will still be important language differences between your server code and your client database is normally a bigger bottleneck than the web so savings are just about everyone knows a little not that many developers really know and understand javascript completely insurmountable technical you constrain the language to a of javascript well supported across most provide an ide that knows this subset and the make some rules about page structure to minimize dom and provide some javascript for inclusion on the client to make the platform a little nicer to the result is something like aptana which can be pretty in the there are just too many pitfalls and little compatibility issues to as expensive as additional servers are still cheap compared to additional and most programmers know how to be much more productive using something really like to see is partial when a page is requested or a form submitted the server platform does validation in perhaps as a plugin to the web server completely independent from the rest of but the is built using the platform of your	
 going to advise a company on a project and not too sure about what programming language i should a fairly straightforward application with a central datasource on the for storing and editing parts that make up a the machine needs to be configured in the and with this configuration production documents bill of are if part a and b are added to the configured then variation x on chapter 5 of the manual has to be if that makes a few components like a tree with radio and it has to have some sort of version control in it needs a wysiwyg editor to edit chapters of it necessarily have to run on platforms other than windows because it will only be used on the company network and everybody runs was thinking java because of huge numbers of useful libraries and free a java programmer myself so not very familiar with other programming any thoughts on what language i should and i believe a bit of and delphi knowledge present in the company not an it company and not likely to program it language do i use for my	
 going to answer part of this question and it yes this can be you have two options on approaching the region can try to fit your window management into the region you would essentially have to write a region adapter for the docking library you would like to infragistics actually provides a cal region adapter for their docking library that you could take a look at different way of doing it is to create a service that provides an interface for modules to use to show register the service it with your unity container and every module can call this is a more flexible way to go since regions out of the box have a concept of it is true that this means that you will be skipping out on the region but it is a trade off of flexibility vs regards to the your shell window will just contain a ribbon control which either all modules have access to or you wrap a service around it so that all modules interact with it through your own interface this	
 going to be a bit heretical and go out on a limb and really need to talk to folks that these folks deal with the concept of every and are always on the lookout for potential exploits to be used against for the most ignore the aspect of how attackers as the days of for are long focus instead on a competent admin will be able to demonstrate this you write a you are presenting what is a smooth interface to in this it may be an or it may be another process on another but it assume that the of your application is potentially regardless if a machine or a believe try writing a small app that takes sales orders from then have a company rule that you need to enforce through that but the salespeople are constantly trying to get around so they can make more just this little exercise alone will demonstrate how a motivated attacker in this intended will be actively searching for ways to either exploit flaws in or to game the system by other these are trusted online games are constantly in a war against cheaters because the server software typically trusts the and in all the client can be resulting in players gaming the think about this here we have people who are simply enjoying and they will use extreme measures to gain the upper hand in an activity that involve making imagine the motivation of a professional bot herder who makes their money for a living this malware so they can use other machines as revenue selling out their botnets to the highest bidder for massive spam of the point your program and at some point be under not enough to protect against stack execution is loaded into the then a return is done to unload the leading to execution of the or other although it does in addition to your programmatic also need to think in terms of and credentials in other dealing with whatever is providing your program input and whatever is consuming your for how does one defend against from a programmatic and you avoid things in code getting your to not turn over their passwords to coworkers is an those concepts into a for rather than a is a not a when you start thinking about the other of your and the you can employ to mitigate those it will become much clearer as to what can go and what can go

 going to invent your own source control perhaps your own operating browser etc means if i ask you to write a small application which take about a be able to come back in about 10 years with an application run on any other machine operating be maintained by anyone else language that using a different source control system and different probably buggy are hard to for perform well you optimise than the well not have a good change log control is also hard to write well how confident are you that you can do a better job than the large teams of people thought about this long and and have proved their systems over you because the company will have gone bust long before you produce are times when worth reinventing some it sounds like you want to reinvent every wheel you ever come use the fact that millions of developer hours have gone into creating decent source control content management plugin scripting languages do you really think going to do a better job than those people save enough time by reinventing the wheel that end up coming out with a product faster than by reusing existing if just for fun a different matter but the fact that talking about a team that talking about a commercial anyone designing their own source control system part of the task of building a different is unlikely to be able to make a persuasive case for doing so with the possible exception of

 going to need the email address in the then have to store them in plain could encrypt of this is effectively security through obscurity in this if your perimeter is your data within it can be plain encrypting here adds complexity to you working with the but really stop an attacker from getting your raw you if he gets through your perimeter likely to easily get your decryption key to decrypt the email encryption may slow down the determined attacker but will not add any real security to your best scenario is to hash the email address and store this allows you to check the email address against an input value and verify that the email address input is the same as what you have of the major downside for this is that you know what the email address is without that additional so if wanting to regularly email your be out of suspect storing the email address because useful and you want to do something with it send an email in which encrypting just adds overhead to working with that whilst gaining very little in this i would focus on securing access the database itself your and ensure they are as strong as can whilst leaving the data in the database in plain

 going to try to explain the best i can arrays in their fundamental so an array is basically a way to store for instance if you want a list of shopping we would use a one dimensional index holds a specific the data as you can see are represented as now i use something like this will put an integer as index the compiler will tell you that no good and you need to fix that on to matrices or take a piece of squared paper like the ones you use for math and draw a cartesian system and some put the coordinates on different piece of paper and next to them put a for this means is that at index i have a representation would be like system in form of a matrices 1 1 0 0 0 0 used just simple arrays to illustrate what are for example if you want to go 3d the data structure for that would be a array of matrices aka a list which holds each cartesian location at a specific we had as height and the same dots as above it would be something you want a way to grab a simple list of problems and try to implement them using arrays of any there is no quick way to do just have patience and

 got a custom web part with accordion panes from the ajax control toolkit as children that are used to render a site map each pane includes a div with text input and 3 linkbuttons used to edit the sitemap and all these controls are created in the overridden createchildcontrols the linkbutton is the event handler is and a new node is added to the when the postback the control should with the empty node in the but it after a new get the new node after reading for a i thought my problem was that i was creating my child controls too early in the process because createchildcontrols is called before control events are so i moved that bit to the onprerender but now the control events fire because hooking them up too late in the page lifecycle control events not question is how do i ensure that the custom control renders the results of its child control event an does it matter that doing this in a web part rather than a custom server control is the lifecycle a dynamic

 got an answer via sql server portion here from aaron key here is that all report model queries are centered around a and each row at the detail level in your report represents a row in this base you may note that in your there is no entity which corresponds to charge for an order or just the order if it has no you need to explicitly create this entity in the based on a named query in the this named query can just select the keys from the ord table and the charge table with a left outer join between the you then create relationships from these keys to the ord and charge and update the model on model root node and you start with details from ord and navigate through the new role to charge and select additional report builder will choose the entity as the entity of the are considering functionality for a future release to allow creating these types of queries directly in report builder without requiring the model designer to explicitly create the left outer join

 got some experience with but only with a web application where the content of the master page been wondering how you would handle a site where for example the menu is on the master is loaded from a where would you load this you would load the menu in the of the master or have the menu as a user control and do the loading in the of but where is this done in you create a class that inherits from that you use for all your controllers and let that load the menu on every action invocation know if but it seems do you create a utility method that you call in every action where you want it some actions may only return a partial view that reload the which while not disastrous seems a little would you sin against mvc and just load it in the master the best approach to this course not limited to my would this be done in

 got some very large xml files which i read using a pretty fast fast but i want it to pool as some long strings occur very many xml looks somewhat like long column long column third freaking long column can column names really be this long column long column third freaking long column can column names really be this more rows go the classes the xml is deserialized into look somewhat like report public rows row public columns column public string name public string value the data is a new string is allocated for every column i can see why that is but according to my that means a few duplicated strings make up some of the memory used by the imported consider it a very good to spend some extra cpu cycles to cut memory consumption in is there some way to have the pool so that duplicates are discarded and can be reclaimed the next time a gen0 gc some final change the xml an exported file from a know could make a faster parser using an and it would not only allow me to do my own string but also to process data during so that not all 200k lines have to be saved in ram until read the entire rather not spend the time writing and debugging a custom the real xml is a bit more complicated than the so quite a and as mentioned above the really does perform well enough for my just wondering if there is an easy way to tweak it a could write a string pool of my own and use it in the but rather not as that means fiddling with and it opens up for a slew of problems related to concurrency and memory by i mean as that can cause memory an xmlserializer pool strings to avoid large duplicate

 guess it depends on how you want it to you are moving and you click do you want it to stop moving up and go would store the previous grid location when you make a that way if you click to move elsewhere you can hop backwards and change the movement if you are moving up and you click you could set the movement speed to be the opposite of what it is hard to answer with out knowing what you want it to behave	
 guess the advantage of having your xml reside there in your project solution is that you can maintain it in vs with nice formatting and even but then using something like xml spy or whatever can give you that refer to it in a class need to ensure you have access to and that it resides in a reliable the past used post build events to move the latest copy of the file to where i need as arnshea writes here is another the output you can use the to output property on the xml file itself to achieve then your classes can use the xml knowing it will reside in a reliable need to make sure accessible though especially if writing back to make sure it end up as source control system could do to storing these files in a folder under program files could also be problematic especially on where user privileges are	
 guess the answer depends on where you want the red as part of the navigation bar or just under that would be only 1 pixel but designers are demanding these days you want it below the navigation bar you definitely have to put it in all of the views where the line is a surprisingly simple way to alter the look of the navigation i used it for skinning the entire navbar look but it will probably work for even only some parts of the navbar if you make the image partially we want to skin the of a in your navigation a 320x44 image containing your custom navbar a to the where the the property of the to the almost except that the title view will be resized in wierd to fix that i have a subclass that keeps the image properly 0 instead of using a above use this	
 guess this a programming but one of my	
 guess this is entirely subjective and everyone has the own i hate functions that are larger than about a screen length and then i try to separate things but then my colleague hates spaghetti code and if the code is still doing the same unit of work then it should stay in that if you are using oo properly and have designed well you really have this problem too many here i offer you official those of you not wanting to follow the link they recommend 2000 feels right to	
 guess what the original author had in mind was something in the lines of hierarchical mysql does not have native support for hierarchical queries for example where you could use to achieve what you the easiest way to remove all orphans would be to execute a query select from table left join table t2 on where is would yield you all rows from where their parent this with a php script that keeps executing the query and deleting any and after a couple of iterations your table should be free of orphans whole thing can probably be merged into one delete statement you could just execute in a while need to execute the multiple times because of transitivity consider a situation where an orphan is parent to another with the first iteration remove the first making the next record in chain an make sure you explicitly skip the head of your otherwise end up with an empty table the head by an

 guess your best option would be to test your plugin in a seperate firefox but probably doing that real profiling you should use not sure about but i think it is possible to run xul apps inside of firefox integrating it as a if this is not an option then you could maybe separate out code that you suspect to be slow into a web page and profile it with this would of course only work for stuff that is not interacting with the mozilla	
 guessing the problem is that the in your code is a ui updates are not but must run through the message queue in windows and then be painted to the the queue is pumped and painting takes place in the same thread as your a any tasks need to be moved to a different more than your line line of code needs to called after that thread otherwise you set the progress bar and then immediately turn it off way to do that is with a backgroundworker	
 guessing this a fairly easy but run into this problem a number of times and i find a solution either through searching i know what to search or trial and have the following table structure and table not null not not primary key key into into into table not null not primary key into into you can id 2 in is not used in and id 3 in has a value of 0 for what i want to do is retrieve a count of the number of times each value in b is used in including 2 from and count of all the values not in have come up with the following as as join as b on by it obviously only returns the 1 can i get the with only 1 2 am using guessing the answer is is there no other way other than a can i count all the records in the both tables in a relationship in 1	
 guessing using probably need to find some way of having a so that the registry of instantiated objects prevent them from being you can modify all the you could inject a static member to keep track of all instances and have the destructor of an instance remove itself from the static for you could use a base class or utility class like the instanceregistry static work would need to be done if you want a different registry for different types of

 had a similar problem of hibernate mysql connection getting timed we tried with the following size was set to made the timeout problem go but we started facing another long have a service running on which receives something like requests per every request needs to connect to mysql through most of our requests do with an every normally the request serve time for us is for select and for after using the above c3p0 we saw that every request completing after an update was taking almost from our it seemed that randomly a select request will get stuck and will be able to complete only after an update request was received and problem goes away if we remove the c3p0 can somebody suggest what we could be doing is the complete hibernate config for configuration dtd transaction isolation 2 configuration pool via seconds seconds	
 had a similar situation but was generating the string in the code then sending it to the of course this is used on a very small table so i was not to worried about thought it might though it assumes you are using generates a string and checks for string as public static string string string result bool isunique while the result if isunique return builds the string public static string string random chars random rnd new for i i random return checks database tables based on type for if exists then or private static bool string bool result string sql if sql exists from mytable where uniquestring begin select 1 end else begin select 0 end the db to see if in result return

 had once a situation where i had to override the event handler in some derived class of i could not unfortunately just it since the implementation logic was bound strictly to that particular method implementation in the base natural idea was to first the original event handler from the event and then to bind my own so i tried to use the operator new eventhandler which point the compiler complainer that it had no access to the private method since the base class was a part of the library i did not really want to modify its implementation simply as it seems by just turning into so simple to attach an event handler to an why is it so difficult to get rid of i wanted because the base implementation was casing some problems did not handle our particular so i wanted to redefine but even after i attached my event handler the base implementation was getting executed since it was doing some kind of my own implementation was never going to run since the request processing was being broken at server after there anyway to get rid of an event handler in a base class from a library without modifying its to an event handler attached to an event in the base class when in a derived	
 had previous on how to make memorystream play in wmp activex and got a reply with a link to boxedapp not a freeware so i studied the process and i figured out that it is using a virtual file for the stream to be saved and that its filename is used as the my question is how to create a virtual file that returns a handle which should be then be accessed by a i am using delphi process on how to make memorystream play in wmp activex or any a virtual file and return a is my handle is then accessed by a copies the content of the memorystream to be activex in my accesses the player plays to create virtual file in delphi

 had this very same problem when i started using the solution is you just have to edit the c syntax file used by how to do you start editing a c or vim reads the default c syntax file located is where you have vim you can find out default value by opening vim and using the command can simply overwrite that or you can create your custom c syntax file will be loaded by vim instead of the default in this pc or have never used a mac so i dunno which one will work for you can find out more in the vim the fun copy the default file to your vimfiles directory for and edit it by adding these highlight class and function match ccustomparen match ccustomfunc match ccustomscope match ccustomclass def link ccustomfunc def link ccustomclass now functions and class names will be highlighted with the color defined in the highlight if you want to customize you can change the last two lines above to something like def ccustomfunc def ccustomclass you can leave the c syntax file alone and define colors in your vimrc file ccustomfunc ccustomclass the absence of the go to for for the available parameters to the command see can find the complete file for vim on this link only use this if you have a version the obligatory for

 handlers are not dom the attribute exists in markup only not sure why ff oks go research that now cause i want to seems to be mixed feelings about whether eventhandlers are attributes or looks to me like this is fault as they internally do not treat them as whilst the html spec indicates that they very much the direct consequences of this are that a number of things would consider attributes cannot be set with setattribute in ie including eventhandler bindings and importantly also class and apparently ie8 fixes this but i still installed that so i for event binding use the pair or preferably because a direct set directly to your target method more likely a closure on your fix your styling not being correctly applied use or the problem is avoid using

 happens if there is a problem accessing the log file when you initialize the log can happen if you initialize the log system if you run your program while another copy is running and writing to the log or if you are editing the log file in a text basically anything that causes a write lock on the log file when log4net init your code for duplicate calls to log4net init perhaps you are initializing in a constructor instead of in a static constructor or global for can also happen if you are running in a configuration and include the pid in the because each different web server process tries to write to the same if using web gardens and writing to add the pid to the filename pattern so each server process gets its own

 hard to judge the joel quote without any prior give my opinion from a sustainable software development point of view which things is good and you should do it whenever you feel like things have spun out of things get out of you often write the same bit of code better the second time around because you have learnt from your previous you and start afresh and decide to continue you may just be adding to the often developers write code and get too far into their first attempt that they think they can code their way out of if you are in that rollback and start again and be much easier to write the code you want and not have it turn out looking like a plate full of into the habit of out code forget about code quality and just spend a amount of time to code a simple version and then start again and find that be easier second time around when you do it with quality and testing in sure what just said within the context of the quote as it probably refers to systems many years old and not to the entire code base from scratch

 has a limit of 10mb each on static files uploaded through right at the bottom of obviously you can write code to slice large files into bits and reassemble at download but it suggests to me that google expect app engine to be used just as a simple and that if you want to use it as one have to do some s3 does the job out of the all you have to do is grab a interface you want to do something with file access on then probably amazon expects you to spring for a server instance on once this is you have much more flexibility than but you pay more cash and probably in plus point for gae is that it has on its side for small apps to 1gb 1gb bandwidth and million hits a day are depending on your this might be or it might be irrelevant on the scale of your total bandwidth i have just this last couple of days looked at gae for the first i took an old perl cgi script and turned it into a gae which is up and about 10 hours including reading the gae introductory docs and remembering how python is supposed to work enough to write a couple of hundred speculate more effort than loading a bunch of files onto but less effort than maintaining ec2 i used to this sounds like the advantages are all with amazon for commercial this may well be but then gae is not yet mature and presumably will get better from here fairly they only let people start paying in december or before that it was except by special arrangement with while google sometimes takes flack for its claims of i think gae genuinely is still starting if your app is a good fit for the bigtable data then it might scale better on gae than for storage i assume that s3 is already good enough for all reasonable and clever architecture gives gae no advantages to compensate when all doing is serving except that google has just offered me a preview of java just noticed that you can set up chron but limited by the same rules as any other request second modify

 have a gui of several frames that build their contents each frame creates comboboxes etc to be used as input this is working very well and we are also planning to let each frame build its content in separate there is one big it is rather creating the controls takes no time but setting the parent property seems to be very time have tried several ways to speed up the process but with no i have tried but nothing seem to affect the time consuming process of setting the parent of the if we use threads this will take time since the vcl functions must be called within there any other way to speed up the creation and showing of there are no data aware components or any events triggered in the i am only creating the controls and displaying using timers i have identified the assignment of controls parent as the time consuming as shown in the answer below the speed problem is not setting the parent but the painting of the when i tested the timing the container was visible and setting the parent caused immediate painting of the another time consuming part of our dynamic gui is assigning items to where dataitems have no more than three to six you all for taking the time helping speed up dynamically created controls

 have a large list of integers and i want to extract the first n the order of unique elements from each integer in the list occurs roughly three an algorithm to do this is but i wonder the most speed and memory efficient way to do are some additional constraints and informations in my my i extract my uniques multiple times on the each time skipping some elements from the the amount of elements that i skip is not known during i even have a upper therefore sorting is not speed efficient have to preserve the order of the integers are all over the so a as a lookup solution is not want to avoid temporary allocations during the search at all current solution looks roughly like int int int startpos while a temporary used int get next int element check if the element if the element is not return the position where it could be inserted while the array if insert the new unique element while preserving the order of the insert into array algorithm gets the job but the performance is not the call moves elements around a and this slows everythign everyone deserves an accepted but i can give only implement a bunch of your ideas and do a with some typical the one with the idea that lead to the quickest implementation the accepted run the code on a modern pc and a embedded and weight the results will post the results as results of the on a 100 iterations over a 160kb 203 and bruteforce 219 binary tree 390 438 and inplace binary tree absolutely rocks for true random distributions has a tendency to be works very well on my testdata for more than 32 it performs almost first n unique integers from an

 have a scheduled task that runs a script on a regular basis this script does some heavy interaction with the database and filesystem and regularly takes several minutes to the problem the spikes while the script is running and slows down normal is there a way to throttle this process so that it takes longer but does not consume as many looked at different configuration options for php but there does not appear to be any that fit my in to something lower causes my data objects to overflow quite seen similar posts where people suggested using at certain points in the script but that does not prevent the script from spiking the optimal solution would be some way to tell the lamp this case stack to only use max cpu not concerned at all about runtime and would prefer that it take longer if it means saving cpu cycles per my alternate solution would be to setup a different server with database replication so the cron could go to town without slowing everything else windows server apache php mysql appreciate any insight to this i appreciate all the even the ones that are still early enough in my situation to change the hosting hopefully this question will help others out regardless of the for throttling a php	
 have a script that uses phpmailer to send out an the email is sent with a direct smtp connection to a remote mail the problem is that while everything seems to be okay when i run the script on my local when the script is run on our live site using the same remote smtp server the email never gets curious is that it seems to have worked at one point in time and has decided that it just going to work potential points of failure are i do not have access to the smtp server in question so i check its log files without submitting a support and although i was just given sudo access to the web server that is sending the not quite sure what looking for in terms of logfiles to go my local machine is running ubuntu and the remote machine is running red hat enterprise linux es release 4 update so there is a bit of a difference in but all really looking for is a few pointers on where i should be looking for and mail never shows up when sent from remote works fine on local

 have an server which keeps track on a number of if the birthday is known it is stored as a datetime attribute called now i would like to have another attribute which keeps track of the current age of the since age can change any day i figured a script might be the best thing i was to create a stored procedure which computes the age given the birthday as here is what i came up procedure int when then 1 else 0 i created another script which runs through all records that have a non null dayofbirth attribute and updates the age filled cursorquery cursor for select clientid from clients where dayofbirth is not next from cursorquery into set dayofbirth from kunden where exec update clients set age where clientid fetch next from cursorquery into would trigger the script above once per day to populate the age thats what i have so but i have the feeling there is plenty of room for thanks sung meister ended up with something like table client int primary datetime as when dob is null then else case when and or then 1 else 0 to properly populate the age

 have been asked recently to produced the mips of instructions per for an algorithm we have the algorithm is exposed by a set of we have exercise the code on a dell axim to benchmark the performance under different question came from our hardware but i am mostly a hl software developer so i am not sure how to respond to the maybe someone with similar background can our algorithm is not real i think we need to quantify it as is it possible to simply quote the total number of assembly 1 is how do you do this how to measure the number of assembly either in general or specifically for 2 be performed on a wm device or via the device emulator provided in 3 be a lot for your for all your i think hit the and as a follow i now have more any suggestion on how to go about measuring i heard some one suggest running our algorithm and comparing it against benchmark to calculate since the algorithm does not need to be run in real is mips really a useful what are other ways to quantity the processing have already measured the runtime performance but it was not a satisfactory i assume mips is a crude estimate and would be on optimization to calculate mips for an algorithm for arm	
 have been dropping hints at a version of office with an integrated vsto in the same way as the vb6 ide is integrated for so the vs ide would be integrated for ever since was first just how much coding is involved and given that this would not produce any features that would be visible to users i very much doubt that this is high on the microsoft priority i can imagine that they layer a managed code set of objects over the top of the existing codebase as joel spolsky layered a set of com objects over the existing c codebase when putting vba into excel in the first and bung a new ide in as the while hiding the old even that would be a major exercise writing the macro of this would make a for which the office team will only accept at will never actually remove vba from the of course excel still supports excel 4 and word still has the wordbasic automation object to support word 6 and no sign of either of those being since there is too much legacy code to support and has used either of those coding models in a microsoft do ever put a environment into office i doubt will ever then they might stop adding vba support for new office the closest get to discontinuing

 have had recently two telephone interviews where been asked about the differences between an interface and an abstract i have explained every aspect of them i could think but it seems they are waiting for me to mention something and i know what it my experience i think the following is if i am missing a major point please let me single method declared in an interface will have to be implemented in the properties and methods can exist in a a class can implement multiple abstract methods have to be implemented by the an abstract class can have normal methods with abstract class can also have class variables beside properties and a class can only implement one abstract class only due of in all the interviewer came up with the question if you had an abstract class with only abstract how would that be different from an i know the answer but i think the inheritance as mentioned above another interviewer asked me what if you had a public variable inside the how would that be different than in abstract i insisted you have a public variable inside an i know what he wanted to hear but he satisfied to use an interface instead abstract class and vice abstract do you decide between using an abstract class and an vs abstract class

 have used the database testing that is built into visual studio 2008 database edition on a project it works but feels more like a third party to visual studio than a native some of the pains i felt with it sql code lives in the res files and a single code file can include multiple it is not as easy to search for tests based on multiple tests live in the same code you have some annoying variable name collisions if you have two tests in a single code all of the assertions for those tests have to have unique that means your assertion names will probably look like which really be your tests is not easy for if you want to move a test from one code file to the easiest way is to create the test from scratch in the new file because there are bits and pieces of the test scattered about the res file and the code of that as i started with it does work we have not added these tests to our continuous integration server so i comment on how easy it is to automate the running of these we are using tfs for and i am assuming that automation of the tests would work very similar to automation of standard unit in other it seems like there should be an mstest command line that would run the this is only an option if you are licensed to run visual studio 2008 db edition i understand is now included in the vs 2008 pro

 headers is the origin server sending back with your in order to be cacheable by i believe you generally have to specify either a or etag in the response web servers will typically do this automatically for static but if your content is being dynamically served if from a static then you have to ensure they are and handle request headers such as and since i got pointed to this question by your subsequent question about is there a header coming out in the for tells caches that the content can vary according to the cookie header in the so static content wants to have that but your web server might be adding that to all requests if there is a regardless of the nature of the data being my some experimentation with the http headers to see what the effects are on caching is of great i remember finding that the solutions were not always	
 headers terminate with a double line break with no space in between an empty a line break can be either or as i have just in some cases but i think you could match it with a regular expression

 i am using yet so i am trying to make simple what is too complex for me managing backing beans with conflicting navigation external params breaking rules and so for example when i need a backing bean used by other simply i call it using facescontext inside other backing but often too wired up to jsf rules to be really and of course more simple is more useful become the with only a bit of cross browser javascript a form copy and a on a i create a sort of proxy form inside the main user page disassociated from jsf navigation but using jsf ajax gives me flexibility on the user but data is always managed by i demand all user actions to an hidden which build up all needed forms according jsf then a javascript simply clone its form output and put it into the user view level for real command buttons and making the user plays around and when he click a script copies all form values into the real jsf form inside the that invokes the real submit of the what it returns is obviously dependent by your jsf is really a pleasure real interest is to know what are your alternative strategy for using pure ajax and jsf without adopting middle layer like ajax4jsf and all good choices but too much than and jsf using hidden iframe with what do you think about this development

 i fear i may be critiqued for this not being so much of a but ask i do to much in web stuff is what i stick with so not too keen on exactly how all this etc my friend has been trying to quit smoking for a but as many smokers he seems to only make it so he recently posted a status update saying if he had the moral he could do i simple want to create a link to the i then intend to write a script and simple message all his friends with the is this tips in the right direction would be greatly an explanation of how to do this would be an explanation of why i do this would be met with a scowling acceptance and a those who have a here are some anything else you need try to of a my page of his homepage as i see it page update to and see surrounding quit smoking if he had the moral that looks to me like the css code for the this stop him from most likely but it worst case just get a laugh and maybe feel a bit more inclined to drop the it as can i programmatically click the link on a facebook

 i fill up an array of handles with auto reset events and pass it off to waitformultipleobjects with bwaitall bwaitall is this function checks the handles in the array in order starting with index until one of the objects is if multiple objects become the function returns the index of the first handle in the array whose object was now if multiple objects signal get the index of the first do i have to loop though my array to see if any others have now i have a loop along the lines process object that remove the handle that signaled from the compact the of waitformultipleobjects when multiple handles signal at the same	
 i finally the delegate and saw how i could use it to make some of my less readable linq queries more a simple code sample illustrating the in a trivial numbers new to get the count of those that are less than four we might lessthanfourcount n but this can also be written lessthanfour n n lessthanfourcount anyone else give any examples of scenarios where they use that i would not advocate using in a scenario as simple as that shown just an example that hopefully makes the functionality of to use to improve code

 i generally agree with the practice of using classes over style attributes for many performance is one but consistency is often seen people do things the jquery reasonable it is until you apply it to table elements that have default display values for the class much better for this and other the jquery methods like are an exception to they handle display setting correctly and give you the	
 i get paid to maintain any most of the time working on new hence adding new features all the each feature needs to be tested and debugged so you can say that of the time spent implementing a feature will go into debugging	
 i get your point like to support users writting the where clause externally i mean users are real users and not developers so you seek solution for the code where condition i just though this because you mentioned if correct what you want to do is really the user the ability to use column the ability to describe a bool function will serve as where the query dynamically and this task let me propose rules from the for rules several designers available not to mention the ones shipped with visual studio the web another but several ones for that start with without then examine examples from a very flexible and customizable other linq has connection to this problem as a function returning iqueryable can defer query you can previously define a query and in another part of the code one can extend the returned queryable based on the condition then can be sticked with extension	
 i grossly overcomplicated the true issue by specifying the problem down to a specific when it turns out not even a simple test attribute on the would return an expected i also realized that i access which resulted in a raging ultimate the project was compiled as a class config files are available at the application since i was using nunit to run the the configuration file from the test project was overriding the development one for the class this is probably obvious to any developers who are not stuck in adding the following to the within the test filling in the corresponding the data could be accessed as this will save someone hours of

 i hear the term flow based programming i think of ie component processes scheduling is driven primarily by a change to its input this really is lego programming in the sense that the labview platform was used for the latest crop of mindstorm however i disagree that this makes it a less useful programming industrial systems which typically involve data and it fits very what is any control system if not data in transformed to data ie what component in your control scheme would you not prefer to represent as a black box in a bigger if you could do to achieve that level of architectural clarity using other methodologies you might have to draw a data domain class then a problem domain run time class then on top of that a use case and flip back and forth between with flow driven systems you have the luxury of being able to collapse a lot of this information together accurately enough that you can realistically design a system visually once the components are build and question i never had to ask when looking at an application written in labview is piece of code set this as it was inherent and easy to trace backwards from the and also mistakes like multiple untintended writers were impossible to create by only that was true of code written in a more typically procedural

 i really like python is but come close to smalltalk in my but i am a biased some answers about which i guess runs on a squeak app runs in several different smalltalks squeak the term is not really used in smalltalk from what heard it would permit good compartmentalization of users as each would have their own little private vm independent of all the systems other users which sounds wonderful from a scaling and redundancy each user has its own wasession and all ui components the user sees are instances living on the server side in that so sharing of state between sessions is something you must do typically through a not done any smalltalk since uni 15 years back and i never dug too deep into it i see much entry level help for seaside or that many projects using is easy to get going with and there is a whole free online book on i suspect setting a server up to run it is hard for the same reason not because inherently hard but just cause there will be less help online and a presumption you are already rather au fait with not in quite tons of help seaside irc on is seaside as good as i think in terms of insulating users from each would say might i be better security sticking to the languages most familiar with so i make any n00b mistakes or will seaside be worth worth scaling the learning curve and prove more comprehensible and maintainable in the long killer argument in favor of seaside imho is the true component it really makes it wonderful for complex uis and if you are afraid of learning then you even consider it in the first place i then i would warn but if you are not afraid then you will probably love squeak is a truly awesome development environment debugging live seaside changing code in the debugger and resuming etc it	
 i recently wrote a review of using several major ides with eclipse and visual studio and ironpython not a big fan of ironpython studio not really production quality in my the designers target ironpython 1 and the generated code require changes to run them on their own with having to modify generated code is never use the designers with visual studio to generate and then subclass in ironpython to actually implement the working with ironpython any of the python ides will be i like wing because the autocomplete is the best seen in a python you can also teach it to do autocomplete for libraries generating pi working with wing personal is free but the professional version is set your interpreter in the project settings to be though because you lose the interactive shell inside wing which is very useful for trying things means that you need external tools to run your launch your but using the wing scripting api or the os tools to integrate these tools into wing is emacs are all editors ides with python integration and will all work very well which you prefer depends on your tastes and you have any other requirements for an general ironpython development i use msbuild to provide build wix for building pyc compiler to compile to binary and a custom executable for the project that is very thin wrapper around the ironpython hosting api written in an editor ide is only one of the tools used and a general python ide should serve you i recently wrote a review of using several major ides with ironpython	
 i rewrote this after i realized i misunderstood your could code up a php script that translates all the style blocks into styles for each the pseudo code could load up an xml parser for the html email generated by your mailing list xpath get all for each parse for the id class of the css style need some regexes for for each id class look up that node by attribute id or class and append to the existing value of the style

 i say on ubuntu sometimes there remains a process eating of making the machine practically there a better way to restart i thought about writing a killall this would be a evil the script is just a quick googled and found that is a wrapper script which starts and makes sure it gets restarted if it should so there should be a better way to restart the googled that this is a common problem in this ubuntu is debian ubuntu doing it wrong at this the script looks quite sophisticated and it deals with but my skills are not good enough to understand it but this would be the best place to this is a paste of the version on my machine is found many hints but i would like this resolved to a certain degree of reliability for production seems to be exactly this unsolved it is this bug from the mysql seems related or people talk of a race condition with 2 instances of others suggest commentiong out the sanity check in the startup script to restart mysql on ubuntu

 i see your source code it is quite hard to help especially since the performance of a wpf application is influenced by a lot of for some hints on what to look out for see wpf application and yes it greatly matters what xaml is used in each because usually performance problems do boil down to many did you know that a textbox are i think 30 individual i recommend you use the profiling tools for to find out more about your specific try to minimize the amount of elements you are using by switching from textbox to textblock where you have to check if the performance problems exist on any pc you try the application maybe the pc you are using is forcing wpf into software based or are you using any at your code i would suggest you change a reasonable fixed since the datagrid does not have to recalculate the width dynamically every time something changes adding or even

 i switch the ide of choice every now and for used for some but skipped it now as for some reason the editor window has got an increased latency that let me type whole phrases into the and i already disabled all time consuming stuff anyways use like code completion on my debian on windows i still love i recently stumbled over and even though i am not the biggest fan of that ide is really nice and it has a class browser and a filesystem and some more features i personally use primarily an but also supports really the only thing i like on monodevelop is that it scintilla or that it cannot be tweaked to be like scintilla am a heavy user of usually compile inside an as that is often painful when it comes to distributing your app or porting it to other operating systems use makefiles or cmake having a handy for compilation is really nice if your app dumps a lot of or when your compiler dumps epic error for you can press to just duplicate the marked text right behind the current cursor to get a glimpse on look at or scite

 i think the answer depends on the nature of the business application that you are what are the slas for your how mission critical is your messaging infrastructure does the application continue to function aside from the lock if then you probably have an obligation to make sure your concurrency control mechanism the single point of the topic of achieving a truly pessimistic locking mechanism requires one to address the of most pessimistic locking algorithms rely on there being a serialized authority that can respond to requests for locks a table or perhaps a singleton lock a design has single point of failure written all over to answer your first seen business applications use messaging to provide pessimistic fully solving the fault tolerance problem seems like overkill for most business applications concurrency control does not have this problem by its nature which is why generally preferred in i realize that business requirements frequently win out over the topic interests google has published an article on their lock which leverages the consensus

 i think you are approaching this pun not intended with an unnecessary degree of i think this unnecessary level of abstraction is what is causing the you are perhaps approaching this from a mathematical theoretical where many of us are approaching this from a trying to solve i believe this difference in approach is causing the programmers look at practicalities and how to actually there are a number of times when you need some totally arbitrary object whose actual instance is totally it just cannot be the example i gave in a comment to another post is the implementation of or or type of which is commonly done by using a backing and using the keys as the you often cannot use as the so what is commonly done is to use a static instance as the which will be ignored and never some placeholder is common use is with the keyword where is needed to synchronize and you want to ensure that your synchronizing item is totally private to avoid deadlock where different classes are unintentionally synchronizing on the same a very common idiom is to allocate a final to use in a class as the to be as of java 5 and and related this idiom is measurably less it has been quite useful in java to have be you could make a good point that with small changes in design or with small api this would no longer be probably correct in the api could have provided a class that extends without adding anything at to be used as a placeholder for the purposes described but if extending but adding what is the value in the class other than allowing to be perhaps one could find a but what value would it add to do are times in programming where you need an concrete object that is not something that you can compare via but you just need any other feature to this it exists only to serve as a unique identifier and otherwise does absolutely satisfies this role perfectly and very would guess that is part of the reason why was not declared it is directly useful for it not to

 i work for a company that makes performance management and capacity a lot of products out there to answer those quest makes a like spotlight for sql spotlight for capacity manager for sql and so no single formula or rule of thumb because each component in the system reacts differently to and each thing storing scales if storing sales data in a data your sales data will grow pretty a simple formula per per you first open your the transactions per day is fairly but as word spreads about your the transactions per day if you start carrying more items amazon going from books to your items per transaction may rise as well but not over as your reporting needs implement aggregate tables to include data about your etc and change the amount of data you store as the other if building a web filtering the formula revolves around the number of employees each company people will surf roughly the same amount over but the formula is affected by whether going to hire more people or lay people you nail down a formula to predict your data that formula necessarily useful to your cpu needs or your bandwidth a each capacity planning product has its own sets of for has something like half a dozen different formulas just to predict disk and not even talking about cpu or memory in a big find that different formulas work better for different types of found that more efficient to buy a product that has all these formulas built in rather than reinvent the wheel to become an expert in predictive i expect me to say that because i work for a but i bought capacity manager as a dba before i came to work for

 i would like to access the list definition view page which i think will be accessible using the above any other options you think we can use to achieve i have tried the following the oob and place it in the same folder as the custom web part which shows the items of the view with your custom a feature to provision the along with your custom web a custom list in the file of the definition for all the views mention the to refer your with this step all the views mentioned in the list definition will use the to create the view pages and as well all the views which you create after the creation of the list will use the as the base page to create the view copy the oob and place it in the server folder as the custom web part which shows the items of the view with your custom basically use the method to get the view and then retrieve the items in the web the code snippet for the custom web part looks like follows list strviewname view listitems getting the list items then do your custom approach of displaying the the web part dll and place it in the a feature to provision the along with your custom web by activating this feature the will be embedded with your custom web the elements manifest file content looks like follows web part for step gives me error for the source file path which i modified by giving the path attribute in the file the base custom view page is available along with the web now how to integrate the custom view page with the list create a custom list definition and for all the views defined in the schema mention the to use the now the custom view page will be used as the base view page for all the views defined in the list definition and as well the views created later also will be using the as the base the sample snippet for declaring the views inside the is as follows and activate the feature of your custom list with all these when you create a list based on this custom list definition then all the views created will be using the to create the view pages and your custom web part will be rendered instead of the oob the views which you will be creating after the creation of the list through object will also use the as the base page to create view some reason i am still unable to see the with my custom am i missing somthing or there is something missing in this

 i would suggest not using the directory because intended for cgi python files that get loaded with are not cgi you should be able to load python files from the but be easier to debug if you give your python files their own your document root is so suggest creating a subdirectory of say to put your python files in just for create any or directives for this directory under the document root but need to put something like this in your virtual host order allow from addhandler pythonhandler pythondebug the file to that directory and try going to and you should see the results of the function in the file

 ia a very broad are you looking to write your own or just a simple application can do that with erb quite biggest pitfall i can see to not using a framework one that is that it will be much harder for other people to figure out what your code is and you lose all the automated data document and other goodies that frameworks tie if you do all the just written a written a horrible mess of spaghetti since a beginning is read the rails and try and figure out what it not because necessarily a great but because your understanding of web frameworks will be a lot more complete by diving into a and this is very looked at a few of your other and it looks like a so going to caution you against writing your own not because a bad idea per but because of what a software framework represents the sum total of years of experience in working with language are like beavers we want to we want to to build always with the idea of fixing the shortcomings of the existing while this is a very noble it tends to lead people down the path of getting very little because they willing to use tools that other people have often for what boil down to cosmetic younger coders are especially guilty of and i was no different i wasted literally years screwing around with writing webservers and database abstraction instead of writing software that i could have made money i could go back and do things i would have started contributing to the frameworks that already rather than just trying to it from there is an exception to that rule of other work and that is when got the experience with the tools to know when time to build something dhh guy who started was a very ruby coder before he decided to write a ruby probably at reading what other people have cooked and rather than just starting on your learn more about the make a valuable contribution to the and give yourself some good resume

 idea here is to write a special type of iterators to virtually merge two as far as is note that i am not creating a new container out of the two existing i am simply jumping from the first to the second did not try and write the actual but although it might a bit long to not technically i am actually surprised not to have found something like that using i did not look for though c2 typedef typedef return now use a bit of magic to define and be able to map2 do whatever you want	
 idea might be to split your list into groups of consecutive values and then compare the contents of another function from the core which will perform the int if throw new if throw new window size must be var arr new var r var i foreach item in i if var res new for j j yield return else r could use the above function like result 3

 ideas off the top of my process monitor process to check what goes on during a build this will let you see if is for instance in mind that response files are probably created with which should prevent disk writes if moved my to a and that gives me minor speedups in a ramdisk that supports automatically disk so you have to use boot scripts to do sequential of a single disk image is faster than syncing a lot of small your header files on the and override your compiler standard paths to use the ramdrive will likely not give much of an improvement after as the os caches the standard your source files on your and sync to the ramdisk the other way check out for doing realtime synchronization between folders it achieves this via a filter so only synchronizes what is necessary only does changes 4kb write to 2gb file will only cause 4kb write to the target figure out how to make your ide build from the ramdrive although the source files are on your and keep in mind that need a ramdrive for large

 important point that i think people here are missing is that with a database that supports parameterized there is no to worry the database engine combine the bound variables into the sql statement and then parse the whole the bound variables are kept separate and never parsed as a generic sql where the security and speed comes the database engine knows the placeholder contains data so it is never parsed as a full sql the speedup comes when you prepare a statement once and then execute it many the canonical example being inserting multiple records into the same in this the database engine needs to only one gotcha is with database abstraction they sometimes fake it by just inserting the bound variables into the sql statement with the proper that is better than doing it

 in mind that i speak put the most important differentiating factor collection is the single most important factor in differentiating between these c and can be used with it is a afterthought and cannot be made to work as well best known is it has to be which means that it cannot collect all unused is designed from the ground up to work on a gc with standard libraries also designed that it makes an absolutely fundamental difference to developer productivity that has to be experienced to be is a belief widespread among users that gc equates with but this is folklore the boehm collector on performs much better than most people expect it the typical fear is of where the program stops so the gc can do some but in reality these long pauses happen with because they run on top of a virtual memory which occasionally interrupts to move data between physical memory and is also widespread belief that gc can be replaced with but it the irony is that in a is slower than a are environments that are so frugal that gc practical but these are increasingly cell phones typically have the gc that typically runs on appears to be adopting about 18 months ago gone through several phases of pure performance tuning with a and the gc is so efficient that it is practically invisible during the operation of the is not a it solve all programming it only really cleans up memory if allocating very large memory blocks then you will still need to take some and it is still possible to have what amounts to a memory leak in a sufficiently complex program and the effect of gc on productivity makes it a pretty close approximation to a is founded on the notion of undefined that the language specification defines the outcome of certain narrowly defined usages of language and describes all other usages as causing meaning in principle that the operation could have any outcome at all practice this means bugs involving apparently corruption of everything about touches on undefined even very nice forthcoming features like lambda expressions can easily be used as convenient way to corrupt the stack a local by allow the lambda instance to outlive the is founded on the principle that all possible operations should have defined the worst that can happen is an exception is this completely changes the experience of software unsafe which has pointers and therefore undefined but that is strongly discouraged for general use think of it as analogous to embedded assembly terms of has to be singled especially if we consider the standardized new does absolutely everything it can to make itself short of assuming and as a result it has an awesome learning the language designers excuse much of this by saying features are only for library not ordinary but to be truly effective in any you need to build your code as reusable so you the positive is so like a playground for i can assure you that you would have a lot of fun learning how it all fits but i seriously recommend it as a basis for productive new work the wasted on mainstream keeps the language simple in the sense of compiler is easy to but this makes the coding techniques more that not all new language features equate with added some language features are described as because they are shorthand that the compiler expands for this is a good way to think of a great deal of the enhancements to over recent the language standard even specifies some features by giving the translation to statement expands into one it was possible to think of templates in the same but since become so powerful that they are now form the basis of a whole separate dimension of the with its own user communities and strangest thing about c and is that they have a standard interchangeable form of integrating someone code into your project is always a little with obscure decisions to be made about how be linking to the standard library is extremely basic has a complete set of data structures and a way of representing strings but still is there a standard way of finding a list of files in a is there standard library support for parsing or generating what about accessing be writing a web site are you you have to go hunting further for try but does it use to represent of course do all these libraries have their own bizarre customs for naming classes and you situation in be more the fundamentals were in place from the so everything beautifully because the fundamentals are supplied by the there is not all generics should have been in place from the start but which does leave a visible scar on some older but it is usually trivial to fix this also a number of popular libraries are ported from which as good a fit as it first methods with local variable and c are practically the last remaining mainstream languages to lack and libraries can be designed and used much more neatly with them than without is one reason why ported java libraries sometimes seem clunky to a amusing thing about is that its standard library was designed as if closures were available in the language then ten years went and now finally being they will have a huge impact as noted they leak underfined and javascript are the most widely used languages in which closures are major difference between those languages being that is statically typed while javascript is dynamically put this last only because it appear to differentiate these languages as much as you might all these languages can run on multiple oses and machine c is the most then and finally can be used on most major platforms thanks to an open source implementation called experience of porting programs between windows and various unix flavours was never tried porting anything very complex in to so i comment on

 in templates and generics are compared to java generics which are but they have also large like in there is runtime support by using getting an object describing the types used to instantiate a have and all it does with types is done at compile biggest difference between generics and templates indeed are that generics are better type they are always in the sense that they allow operations that are not stated valid at the time of defining the chief designer raised as a reason of that the added complexity it would have taken to have implied not well versed with so i talk further talk about about how matters are in and how they are going to be so that people think stuff is all templates are not if you do an at template definition time it is implied that the operation will succeed at instantiation not even required to a compiler that the template is syntactically checked for if it contains a syntax then that error has to be diagnosed at any diagnose before that is a pure goody of the implied constraint have shown to be easy for the template designer in the short because they have to care about stating the valid operations in their template they put the burden on the user of their template so the user has to make sure he fulfills all those often it happens that the user tries seemingly valid operations but with the compiler giving the user hundreds of lines of error messages about some invalid syntax or not found because the compiler know constraint in particular was violated in the first it lists all parts of code paths ever involved around the faulty place and all not even important and the user will have to crawl through the horrible error message is a fundamental which can be solved by just stating at the interface for a template or generics what properties a type parameter has to as far as i know can constraint the parameter to implement an interface or inherit a it solves that on a committee has long seen there is need to fix these soon will have a way to state such explicit constraints note as in the following requires t return a compiler signals an error at that because the expression as written is not marked valid by the this first helps the designer of the template to write more because the code is already to some degree to what is possible the programmer can now state that requires t return a it will the by seeing appearing as the return automatically implied that is because that use of appears in the rather than in the templates the other requirements were stated using requirement the user will get a appropriate error message if he uses a type that have an decouples the requirements from the the above works for primitive types aswell as for in this they are more but quite a bit the rules that state when and when requirements are satisfied are you can with the new rules say the requires call with an that would work by just writing a concept map for that teaches the compiler how an int can be it will get quite handy in loops like the programmer can tell the compiler how an int can satisfy the concept of an you could actually write such code in if you only write the appropriate concept which really all that enough with i hope i could show you that having templates constrained is not all that but in fact because the relationship betweens types and the operations on them within the templates are now known by the and i even written about which are another nice thing in remember that is future not yet but it will approximately at then we will have to wait for some compiler to implement that all from concepts were accepted into the draft but have been voted out at late of too but perhaps we will see it again in the next all

 in the direct hibernate camp think how likely it is that your going to what to change your database say from db2 to well that is about as likely as changing from hibernate to toplink or eclipse it just going happen that the same old thing that programmers just love to do and that is abstract any stuff so that they can in at some unforeseen point 10 years from now choose to use a different logging tool kit or what are sure people out there that really want the vendor independence of jpa but not one of not to say that toplink or eclipse any i just think you can use a product that complex and not be tied to it in some said that i still follow the hibernate documentation advice and use the jpa annotations and only resort to the hibernate specific ones when i need not quite sure if there is a technical reason for but it

 in the process of migrating a mysql database from debian to windows vista using apache installed and running via database is essentially a carbon every entry is the however when i try to access the i get some strange errors in some cases the first few entries in a table are not recognized by the program accessing the the database and the code in both cases is the same using a java swing application to access the concluded that the issue might have something to do with the different os other differences between the two respective could contribute to these problems even during the copy process of the which i did through the function in one ting i had to change in the java code was a query which entered a new entry into a the primary key was set to and basically in the query the java application sent it had null for the primary key and mysql took care of the in the vista hosted database i was getting an error from that about it being invalid so i changed the null to would this have anything to do with my for any are the differences between mysql hosted on windows and debian

 in there is a need for some code to be run before is if only to transform the command line into the c calling in the standard library needs some and the exact needs can vary from compile to true program entry point is set at link and is usually in a module named something like for historical as the source to that module is available in the crt support initializations that are discovered at link a special segment is its structure is a list of function pointers of fixed which will be iterated early in and each function this same array one very much like of function pointers is used in a link to hold pointers to constructors of global array is filled in by the linker by allowing every module linked to include data in which are all concatenated together to form the segment in the finished only significance to the variable is that it is declared the to be located in that and is initialized to the address of a function to be called during the c the details of this are extremely for general you are probably better served by wrapping your initialization and your current main inside a new char other return special modifying the module itself or doing tricks to get additional early initialization functions called can be the best for when building embedded systems that run from rom without an operating system it is common to need to customize the behavior of the module in order to have a stack at all on which to push the parameters to in that there may be no better solution than to modify to initialize the memory hardware to suit your

 in this i would consider treating the status than as a primary and have the denormalized in the this retains the foreign but reduces the number of joins and navigations it also allows you potentially to map the code to an in your would probably use a lazy cache of the i18n text the query object tracking the number of that are happening you to program just against an enum in the object but display the i18n the i18n implementation you could switch to resx or similar if you needed or an automated translation you to obtain i18n values without being tied to an existing data query to populate a box for a search screen has nothing to do with individual so the example query guessing the i18n data is slow so the cache approach is would load all the strings a language at a time so the first time a status is needed in welsh load the status strings for and cache against the standard code for the make the view code consider using an extension method on the employee the ui static class employeeextensions public static string employee do your funky presumably using the httpcontext some other value to resolve the current culture in your view you can unfortunately there are no extension but with a method you also have the option of passing the into the method adding a

 is a good easy to install and easy to use from have a system using stompserver in production for sending out emails and processing other jobs saves the emails to the a handler in django sends an event to stompserver and stompserver passes the event to a consumer process which does the asynchronous task the scales up quite nicely because you can add consumer processes at runtime two consumers can send twice as many and the consumers can be on seperate one slight complication is that each consumer needs its own named queue so django needs to know how many consumers are available and send events to each queue in a consumers listening on the same queue will both get each message if you only want one consumer process then this an previously had processes which polled the database continuously for jobs but found that it was adding a lot of load to the even when nothing needed to be	
 is a good idea to include a security descriptor for each resource and not only to a in your example the security descriptor is simply id or a list of if you support duets so i would think about adding the list of ids to both the artists and the songs you can add a string field where the artist ids for the resource will be written in solution scales you can add more layers without increasing time needed for security adding a new resource also require any additional penalty except for one more field to insert on parent and of this solution supports special situations described above more than one artists kind of solution also violate restful the fact that each resource contains its own security descriptor generalizes the access making it possible to implement some completely different security policy in future making access permissions more based on not only	
 is a hash which is a one way turning an input of any size into a output bit in this a cryptographic hash function is one for which it should not be possible to find two inputs giving the same output except by brute force with a function you should need to try on average message to find such a due to something called the birthday paradox google it for fact for sha1 this is no longer the case the algorithm is cryptographic terms at broken with a collision attack described by xiaoyun wang et al that beats a classic birthday the sha2 family is not and a process is underway by nist to agree on a sha3 algorithm or family of is an asymmetric encryption encrypting an input into an output that can then be decrypted a hash algorithm which be it uses a different key for encryption public than for decryption private this can therefore be used to receive encrypted messages from others you can publish your public but only you with the private key can then decrypt the messages that have been encrypted with you reverse the keys for it can be used to generate a digital signature by encrypting something with your private anyone can decrypt it with the public key if they are sure the public key belongs to then they have confidence that you were the one who encrypted the this is normally done in conjunction with a hash function you hash your then encrypt that with your private giving a digital signature of a fixed length for your input

 is a local variable so not shared your is reading an oracle sequence or a sql server autoincrement field then the db is taking care of synchronization most excluding so you can probably safely return the result to any calling that the db is guaranteeing that every call will get a different is usually a little bit of work changing the type of a variable will rarely get you thread safety since it depends on how your threads will access the you can save yourself some headache by reworking your algorithm so that it uses a queue that all consumers synchronize against instead of trying to orchestrate a series of or better yet make the algorithm if	
 is a lot of room between the bare metal and you have said you writing an os but not whether or not you are running under an directly on hardware without an you will still want to encapsulate all of your operations in a even if you formally define a device driver interface and framework for all of your modules to this is hugely architecture and makes you responsible for knowing all of the details of interaction with every device you might ever for some this can quickly become a huge development that a problem for embedded but running on commercial hardware this way is neither easy nor within an you probably get want to access to the actual hardware registers and if you are developing a custom the best practice is to make it conform to existing standards so that you need as little low level custom software for it as this is why you see a lot of custom user interface gadgets connecting via usb and identifying themselves as hids interface as a the existing usb drivers take care of the physical and the hid driver takes care of the logical providing a very simple high level access api to the of the operating key roles is to provide a consistent api across all that takes the form of and functions names but some form of at least the first four will always the os layer is quite an os call is forwarded without much processing to a device which then forwards the data on to the the os low level calls block the caller until they and often they have restrictions on the sizes of the buffers that make for raw access to a disk device is usually required to be for an integral number of disk blocks at a forget about things like file systems and network all of which are made much more reliable and compatible by encapsulation within an operating if it is acceptable to call and for single that is usually not the best performance operating system calls are relatively and if you can read multiple characters in a single your performance can go way is the origin of the stdio library for and various other buffering libraries in other the stdio library provides a buffering layer that isolates the c code from the block size of the underlying even on an entirely operating system where you have full control over all the something like c stdio will still be your own stdio replacement is a highly valuable even if you use it in production and is one i would recommend to anyone wanting to learn about what really goes on between and and the terminal or valuable resource is the book standard c by in the author presents an implementation of the complete c runtime library specified in the ansi his discussion of the specific implementation choices he made is valuable and apropos to the context of this and the discussions of why some of the standard library features were specified is interesting as

 is an acronym for resource acquisition is technique is very much unique to because of their support for both constructors destructors almost automatically the constructors that are matching that arguments being passed in or the worst case the default constructor is called destructors if explicity provided is called otherwise the default one that is added by the compiler is called if you write an destructor explicitly for a this happens only for objects that are meaning that are not using the free store using technique makes use of this object feature to handle the objects that are created on the by explcitly asking for more memory using which should be explicitly destroyed by calling the class will wrap this another object that is created on the hence when constructor is the wrapped object is created on the memory when the handle goes out of destructor of that object is called automatically in which the wrapped object is destroyed using with oop if you wrap such objects inside another class in private you have access to the wrapped classes members methods this is the reason why smart pointers handle are designed these smart pointers expose the wrapped object as typed object to external world there by allowing to invoke any that the exposed memory object is made up note that smart pointers have various flavors based on different you should refer to modern programming by andrei alexandrescu or boost to learn more about hope this helps you to understand

 is an interface that allows the iteration through a collection of items via the foreach array is a it holds items of the same but it is of a fixed once you create an array with x it cannot grow or defines the interface for a and also implements implements the ilist it is a concrete type of difference between lists and arrays is that lists can have elements added to them they grow to be big enough to hold all of the required the list stores this internally in an array when the array is no longer big enough to hold all of the a new array is created and the items copied arrays both implement how interfaces work classes implement the contract and behave in a similar fashion and can be treated similarly as a result know that the class implements you need to know the hows or the i suggest you read up on interfaces and so

 is due to the different way that the clr handles structs and structs are value types which means they live on the stack rather than in the managed it is a good rule of thumb to keep structs small because once you start passing them as method arguments you will incur overhead as structs are copied in their entirety when passed to a classes pass a copy of their reference to methods they incur much less overhead when used as method best way to determine the size of your class is to total the number of bytes required by all the members of your class plus an extra 8 bytes for clr overhead stuff sync block index and the reference to the type of the

 is how i do using for form in endfor a javascript var newelement var total type var name total var id var newfor total type it accepts as the first and the of formset as the 2nd what the should do is pass it what it should in this i pass it so that jquery looks for the last table with a class of the part of it is important because the is also used to determine what the new form will be inserted more than likely want it at the end of the rest of the the argument is so that we can update the notably as well as the actual form if you have a formset full the management fields will have ids of and while the form fields will be in a format of with being the form starting with so with the argument the function looks at how many forms there currently and goes through every input and label inside the new form replacing all the field from something like to and so after it is it updates the field to reflect the new form and adds it to the end of the function is particularly helpful to me because the way it is setup it allows me to use it throughout the app when i want to provide more forms in a and make me need to have a hidden form to duplicate as long as i pass it the formset name and the format in which the forms are laid hope it

 is in sqlite so been trying to see if there are any performance improvements gained by using sqlite disk based basically like to trade startup time and memory to get extremely rapid queries which do hit disk during the course of the the following benchmark gives me only a factor of in improved generating 1m rows of random data and loading it into both a disk and memory based version of the same i then run random queries on both returning sets of size approx i expected the memory based version to be considerably but as mentioned only getting experimented with several other sizes of dbs and query the advantage of seem to go up as the number of rows in the db not sure why the advantage is so though i had a few table used big enough to make a huge would make the advantage more is some kind of caching going on at the connection or os level such that the previous results are accessible corrupting the is some kind of hidden disk access going on that not seeing tried lsof but i did turn off the pragmas for i doing something wrong any thoughts on why producing nearly instant the to see whether offers significant performance numpy as c to avoid hitting trading safety for make a demo table if not exists demo id2 val index on demo index on demo for row in into demo start foo diff return build some fake data with 3 1000000 700 uniques in 1st 5000 uniques in 2nd load it into both dbs build execute a series of random queries and see how long it takes each of 300000 number of ids of each qq in qsize id1a uniqueness of ids id2a id1s for xx in id2s for xx in query from demo where id1 in and id2 in now look at the disk memory row in print the note that disk takes about as long as memory for a fairly wide range of query disk memory ram be almost instant relative to going wrong good suggestions guess the main takehome point for me is that probably no way to make but there is a way to make disk access other the benchmark is adequately measuring the realistic performance of but not the realistic performance of disk because the pragma is too big or because not doing mess around with those parameters and post my findings when i get a if there is anyone who thinks i can squeeze some more speed out of the db than by jacking up the and which i will all performance benchmark why is so as fast as

 is more focused on the infrastructure and support side and not so discussion of itil is probably more appropriate on the focused version of stackoverflow that is supposedly in as an i take exception with calling that other site focused as it encompasses and development in most a good percentage of stackoverflow users are developers in it worked with cmmi and the team software process both products of watts humphrey and the carnegie mellon software engineering if you are committed to continuous improvement and believe that measurement is at the heart of any continuous then you will find value in is very easy to do cmmi wrong or in a way that alienates developers and ultimately ends up as window dressing or something that looks good on a pile of look at the development vendors in are miraculously all cmmi level what they tell you is that was almost always one small project or team in their organization that worked hard to get the but the repeatable practices are simply not there for of their focus on time tracking defect tracking lines of code of ways to if you are so and making your process repeatable a developer feel like a cog with no freedom to turn off many note the jaded in fact remains that of the developers out there of which read stackoverflow or any technical shoot from the hip and are sorely lacking in of where their opportunities to improve for the process rigor and opportunity to make incremental improvements in quality through the that repetition and measurement facilitate are valuable components of you get the same benefits from agile methods like scrum where again the focus is on repeatable learning from each and in on your it takes a lot of maturity and experience to lead a team in adopting either agile methods or cmmi and get full value out of is sexy and cmmi is about as far from sexy as you can which is why you hear about it as

 is mostly implementation the idea is to minimize allocation requests memory easy to prove that by doubling the existing size every time the block is both allocation count and memory fragmentation are therefore typically stl container implementations will double the existing block when thing you can do is use a custom allocator that will not allocate more than construct your objects when you no longer need to manipulate them when done just swap into a new object this is basically what others have done in their and you can use a pooled memory allocator to minimize memory wasted slack and improve for and

 is no of doing this in only various accepted and many mediocre and just plain bad php gives you a nice open space to do it however it makes sense to this is arguably its greatest but this is also a big just because you do it however you like mean you seen numerous projects that do it all different the methods currently involve separating out data data access and data presentation using a framework usually with a central dispatch they have their own rules about how to arrange your directories and where to find the older method involved treating each file as a it had a few at the top of the file that setup the including database handlers and other but also defined functions for building the common elements of a the file was in two it did all its processing and access in the first and then built its output in the second a variation of that has it include a separate file for the this is closer to the spirit of php and is easier to make work from

 is no support for rtl languages in yui i filed a bug about it over a year ago and got a response saying they might add it in a later can no longer find the bug since they switched to their new hopefully adding rtl support for yui but i checked out the preview releases can i find them mentioning adding rtl not to say yui menus cannot do though it takes a bit of work as no i make no claims that this works in all especially not you need the menu items to flow the opposite and start on the opposite side of the i believe this works in most browsers of argh for that you need to do some extra work which i remember the answer you need the submenus of the menubar to flow the opposite you can do this by changing the attribute of your for the main you have to manually add all the so that you can set the submenualignment on worst part is trying to get the keyboard events to work as at this point pressing right makes the cursor go left and to do have to hijack and change it so if the menubar is set rtl this info in a var it processes a bit have to figure this one out on your but it should be a simple matter of switching cases on key

 is not a real answer to you but probably a solution to solve the use an implementation of sql lite for my integration i build up the schema and fill the database before each the schema creation and initial data filling happens really fast then seconds per because an do you use a physical response to answer about question because i migrated my schema and data directly from sql server 2005 and i want it to persist in source recommend to store a file with the database schema in and a file or script that creates the sample data in source you can generate the file using sql server studion management you can generate it from your nhibernate mappings or you can use a tool like sql compare and you can probably find other solutions for this when you need plain text files are stored easier in version control systems then complete binary database does something about the sqlite engine differ such that it would resolve this might solve your problems because you can recreate your database before each your database under test will be in a the state you expect it to be before each test is a benefit of that is there is no need to roll back your but i have run similar test with in memory sqllite and it worked as

 is not essentially asking for a temporal database christopher date calls sixth normal or be a schema must also be for each you need to attach a time range for which the datum at that value is then in the join must include only the rows that are within the time range being modeling is hard what 6th normal form addresses and not well supported in current problem is the 6th normal form i understand supports temporal modeling by making every anything the entity that can change without the entity losing its a separate to you add a timestamp or time range or version making everything a join solves the granularity but it also means your queries are going to be more complicated and it also requires figuring out all keys and this tends to be a large everywhere you have a relation owns the gm stock certificate with id you add a owns the gm stock certificate with id 789 so that you can simultaneously owns the gm stock certificate with id 789 from 3 feb 2000 to obviously these relations are can own more than one certificate and more than one over his and fred can have previously owned the certificate jack owns we have a table of and a table of stock and a table that relates owners and certificates by to the we add a and an imagine that each taxes the dividends on stock so for tax purposes to record the stock state of the owner resides can obviously change independently with stock ted can live in buy 10 get a dividend that nebraska move to sells 5 shares to buy 10 more for ted can move to nebraska some buy 10 shares some get a dividend some which nebraska move to neveda some sell 5 shares to fred some buy 10 more shares some need all of that if we want to calculate what taxes ted owes in nebraska and in joining up on the date ranges in and a address is no longer because address time ted buys ten do we model a buy event with a single purchase or do we add a to each depends on the question we need the model to

 is nothing about its a vital part of the web and most sites use it in some you really have two main either store the object in the database between pages means saving an incomplete or put it in both have advantages and session you have to save a partial object to the but if the user leaves or the session times out you lose all that it can also lead to a larger memory footprint per user and when you get to scaling it causes some other of which can be solved using on a load balancer or central session database way is better in lots of ways but usually you want to save incomplete object to the one compromise is to create another table and to save the object serialized to that its not going through your real tables and so you have to compromise on your database can also store session data in the database which is basically doing the same the end its a judgment call between the two i have used both over the

 is primarily to solve the issue of page fragmentation when your table is clustered by a your table is clustered by an integer i set up two test one where the newsequentialid column is the primary key and one where it is not and in the primary key the guids were always in the they were do not know the reasons it behaves that but it seems clear that is only truly sequential when your table is clustered by it seems to behave similarly to curious as to why you would want to use when you have it has many downsides which does and none of the benefits the biggest being that is not practically whereas if you are not worried about the	
 is probably a dead post but add my two cents of the opinion that build numbers should mean something to everyone who sees so i personally think that this is a good way to name numbers are pretty but from the perspective of the 3rd it still needs to mean something to the released this new version to but it worth a new minor number since we just fixed some so incremented the patch 4th number usually means absolutely nothing to the so you might as well make it useful to you and anyone else in your company that sees so for that number is the svn revision it tells us exactly which revision was responsible for that version so that we can pull it out any any time to recreate branching code obviously achieves this but not to another advantage with an version number is that it easily integrates into nearly every continuous build my two	
 is probably a file being generated in your working this may help you or if you post its contents it might give us more your trying two different on the command line you used it looks like this is finding the entry in but the timeout indicates that it is getting no response whatsoever from the can you ping dbhost your second try you just entered for the which makes sense if you are no accustomed to but as you can see there is no point where it prompts you for the database so in this case it was trying to connect to without a service leading to the second this just means you have a default service name set so this error comes from incomplete would enter for the username to specify the service name at this you can actually enter the whole connect string at the username if you mind the password being

 is rather but the only answer does not seem to be answering my am thinking of using in and am considering how exactly the build process would do projects in visual studio 2008 support custom build actions that generate found the but not sure what looking for it only allows usage integral to the build but rather custom events that fionn suggested are indeed as they take dependencies into account and prolong the build they are managed from a central location instead of to incorporate code generation to a

 is related to an i google static maps api certainly seems like the way to go given the technical however the business constraints are different and starting to think there is no point where they i need to generate a map image with zip code and the zip codes shaded in different ways to highlight some and dim this is obviously not something that google has available in their so is there something i can do on my end to use their their and mix in the zip code without somehow building my own tilesets to overlay the retrieved of sort of like but without usage fees to contend found the boundary but have no idea how to digest them into something to add zip code visualization to google static maps

 is right that immutability would fix but that would also be you could just lock the whole thing but that could be a performance i can think of two good is to use a requires or since your checkpoint can acquire the read lock it can be assured things are but when no one is reading performance should be pretty this is still a pretty coarse so you may also want to do is to break things each area of the program could keep own map map for gui the map for user the map for hardware each one would have a lock on it and things would go about as when it came time to the checkpointer would grab all the locks things are and then do the catch here is you have define an order for the locks to be grabbed in otherwise with the maps are orthogonal to each other to one require updates to another to be then the easiest thing may be to push the updates to a central map in the not unlike something you biggest question to you would how much of a problem is this are updates very or are they that would help to advise on something since my last idea could be but easy and may not is a fantastic book called concurrency in which is basically the java threading it discusses how to figure out this kind of stuff and strategies to avoid problems or make solving them if you are going to be doing more a very useful if your key values are orthogonal to then things are really the interface are implemetations such as the would solve your problems since they can do changes so readers see inconsistent but if you have any two keys that must be updated at the same time this cover hope this threading access to shared data structures is complex

 is software that detects the probability for but this is not an exact as computers recognize what is actually on pictures are only a big set of values on a grid with no you can just teach the computer what is porn and what not by giving this has the disadvantage that it will only recognize these or similar the repetitive nature of porn you have a good chance if you train the system with few false for example if you train the system with nude people it may flag pictures of a beach with naked people as porn similar software is the facebook software that recently came just specialized on the main principle is the you would implement some kind of feature detector that utilizes a bayes the feature detector may look for features like percentage of flesh colored pixels if a simple detector or just computes the similarity of the current image with a set of saved porn is of course not limited to actually more a corner i think more common are systems that try to find other things in images

 it be simpler to simply create a separate thread with its own message queue for your i think casyncsocket needs to be created on the main message just some message see the documentation for cwinthread to see how to create a separate thread with its own message it is crucial that you call all socket operations from the context of the new mfc uses global state in hidden classes that use storage to hold and that information is used in many of the that means casynchsocket has thread affinity and you must always use and create it in whatever thread is to be its message approach would be to create a create your own custom mfc hidden window on that thread creating the window in the context of that and create messages and message handlers on that window for all of the socket operations you assure that the thread is pumping messages method does and then messages to your window to control your remember that callbacks from your socket will come in on a separate thread than your ui or worker need to worry about race conditions and possibly gui thread affinity issues if updating gui worried about the design just create your own cthreadsafeasynchsocket proxy object and delegate to the real implementation through to your hidden you can use sendmessage for blocking operations and postmessage for asynchronous if you wrap the constructor in a factory you can delay creation of the socket thread until its last concern i can think of is that need to detect when all your proxies have gone away and shut down the you can use a global reference count managed by the to detect when to shut down the failing to shut down the thread will keep your app hanging about with a hidden window even after you close your main app

 just one read quite a few books and yet to see anyone else saying use personally think properties are one of the best things about they allow you to expose state via whatever mechanism you you can lazily instantiate the first time something is used and you can do validation on setting a value when using and writing i just think of properties as setters and getters which a much nicer for the caveats with there are a one is probably a misuse of the other can be properties are types of it can be surprising if you place complicated logic in a property because most users of a class will expect the property to be fairly class explicitly obvious that calculation is being done public int return class not at all looks like it may just be returning a cached public int get return find that using methods for these cases helps to make a and more properties can have if you evaluate them while you have some property like int result get return suppose you have an exception that occurs when too many queries are guess what happens when you start debugging and rollover the property in the bad avoid doing looking at the property changes the state of the are the only caveats i i think the benefits of properties far outweigh the

 knowing your full application it is hard to say what the best way to approach the problem but a common technique is to use a header which starts with a fixed length which denotes the length of the rest of your that your header consist only of a 4 byte integer which denotes the length of the rest of your then simply do the this assumes buffer is at least x bytes and that the socket is unsigned int int bytesread int while result buffer x if 1 throw your bytesread later in the int length buffer we assume that will return 4 new then process the data as makes a few are the same size on the sender and is the same on both the sender and have control of the protocol on both you send a message you can calculate the length up it is common to want to explicitly know the size of the integer you are sending across the network define them in a header file and use them explicitly such these typedefs will vary across different such as but the is that a int8 is always 8 and a uint32 is 32 bits regardless of the platform you are these vary from compiler to so you have to look them up in the compiler char short int int unsigned char unsigned short int unsigned int would change the above length buffer new hope this

 law of demeter should be the suggestion of says that you an object to get at their child if as a need to perform some most of the time the domain model working with should support that is in principle a dumb hierarchy of it is like a filesystem of where each object could have child you almost always reach through with you can optionally build up composite object types using rest and as long as the provider and the client agree on you can avoid the how do you balance rest and it seems to me that they are not in because rest is all about coupling to the point where it is pointless for the provider to try to anticipate all the needs of the whereas demeter assumes that logic can migrate to its most natural place through you could argue that rest is just a until you understand your clients is rest just a is demeter unrealistic in any of demeter	
 law of do second do it unless you actually have measured and know for a fact that you need to optimize and if objects are really expensive to and if they can actually be reused can reset the state with only public operations to something that can be it can be two gains you mention are not really memory allocation in java is cost was close to 10 cpu which is so reducing the creation of objects only saves you the time spent in the this can be a gain with really heavy objects that can be reused without you reuse the the same time is not in fact it can be with moving generational gcs or was up to the cost of a gc run is determined by the number of alive not by the released alive objects will be moved to another space in memory is what makes memory allocation so free memory is contiguous inside each gc a couple of times before being marked as and moved into the older generation memory languages and as were designed keeping in mind the common if you steer away from the common usage in many cases you may end up with harder to read code that is less

 like to add a comment that you may wish to think of my clients run including a couple who have moderately large both of whilst they certainly could implement a payment gateway choose not they take the cc store it temporarily encrypted online and process it do this because of the high incidence of fraud and manual processing allows them to take additional checks before filling an told that they reject a little over of all their transactions processing manually certainly takes extra time and in one case they have an employee who does nothing but process but the cost of paying his salary is apparently less than their exposure if they just passed cc numbers though an online of these clients are delivering physical goods with resale so are particularly exposed and for items like software where a fraudulent sale result in any actual loss your mileage would but worth considering above the technical aspects of an online gateway if implementing such is really what you and since creating this answer like to add a cautionary tale and say that the time is past when this was a good because i know of another contact who was taking a similar the card details were stored the website was accessed by and the numbers were deleted immediately after secure you one machine on their network got infected by a key logging as a result they were identified as being the source for several score credit card forgeries and were consequently hit by a large a result of this i now advise anyone to handle credit cards payment gateways have since become much more competitive and cost and fraud measures have the risk is now no longer worth could delete this but i think best to leave up edited as a cautionary

 looking for some feedback on the advantages and disadvantages of the methods available for creating individual development branches in a perforce if i understand there are two ways of handling the first is to create a private which is a complete copy of the branch that you are working the branch would completely stand on its own and completely isolate your changes from the target other method that heard recommended is sparse it is described in this creates a but only with the files that you will need to you then overlap the target branch client view with this sparse dev branch client methods would require the programmer to perform some integration work in order to get their changes in the target the private branch method seems like it would require a lot more additional memory in order to create a copy of the whole the perforce documentation states that it performs a in this also enables perforce to perform a of the when you the server does not actually hold two copies of the files it merely holds the source file and a pointer in the database records the fact that the branch to the target file has lazy copies make branching a the server have to keep track of duplicate copies of makes it seem like the sparse branch method is just adding the possibility of human error to the process for the developer may start working on a file that they add to the sparse branch and then accidentally update a change to the target branch that breaks the the sparse branching functionality exists for a any feedback on why it exists and why i should be using it over a complete private branch vice would be greatly dev branches sparse branching private

 made some research a while specific question from might give you some additional you use nhibernate for a project with a legacy which is partly out of your of your points of interest i can is better if you control both the data model and the can answer it the other way if you have control over the data model and thus facing some legacy ibatis is the better is repeatedly called simpler to learn does this have maintenance consequences easy to hard to depends what you want to do with if you have a domain driven development approach then ibatis might get painful by if you just do simple data manipulation and have a full blown domain model then nhibernate might be a overkill by the both make it easy to switch the underlying database have mechanisms to shield you off from a specific database but i admit that have not done intense research in this skilled do your developers need to be with you use you need more sql skills than using ibatis you always need to code some nhibernate require you to code sql statements it even can do the ddls for powerful features will require you to go to old good which will be other personally find that ibatis much more you can get things done very nhibernate is more but has much more which you can use in wrong is possible to combine the use of nhibernate and you can use nhibernate for your business for reporting where you just read data out of fallback to your application has a longer life cycle and a lot of business consider it has a lot of feature aiding you in handle business community around nhibernate is very active and come up with useful

 management experience from other many industries teaches us that is cheaper in the long run than known as and subsequent also learned that the ranges in most cases from 1 to 2 which means that your investment pays off after considering that investments on that scale are usually expected to reach a break even after 4 this is pretty problem is that it took the other industries several decades to accumulate enough data for being able to that this is the case for you can easily find data to support their conclusion and draw a conclusion for software in analogy to but as of there is no proof for the software being i believe that the analogous conclusion is a pair of developers and one tester are more productive than one developer and two you have problems justifying two expensive developers sitting in front of one computer to the there are many other things that help with defect but are not as visible therefore to the	
 management systems are specifically designed to store data and retrieve it to preserve the integrity of the data and to leverage concurrent access to the on the other was originally designed for separating the content from the it became a handy way to store simple data because the file structure is so well and then it went out of hand with people trying to store entire databases in an unsuited guarantee fast access or anything like not dataset libraries do help in that but just because you can serialize dataset objects to xml make it a good place to store data for multiple faced with two one which was designed to do exactly what you need to do this case a and one that was designed to do something else but has been kludged to do what you sorta this case you should probably go with the first

 manipulation uses native functions to perform simple browser vendors optimize you are building the row from internally jquery is using to build the collection which then patches into the is slow in comparison because js code needs to loop through the dom newer browsers have native selection handling which provides dramatic speedups to selector based as time moves on this will be less of a is how the query in breaks through every element returned elements within the and test with every element still remaining and collect the final is different for jquery as engine moves through the selector the other way beginning with getting all input elements and then testing the parent that the js selector engines implement a lot more of the css selector spec than is actually usable with css implemented by current exploiting and knowledge of the we can optimize selector can be optimized in a few different you know what element type the is faster for filter first for type and then for the class for only those this apply for a very small subset of but that is almost never the case in single class test is the slowest of the common people actually loop is faster than two this only finds input elements and then directly filters them by type since are never unique may also be skipped smart engines will try to do this because unique is more direct more complex selector may actually be faster if it is more direct move the search context up to the table this i mean that instead of looping through the and searching for the checkbox in every leave them alone until after the loop and then select them all at a point of this is to eliminate the overhead of firing the selector engine up but instead do everything in one this is presented here for completeness rather than something that i think would return massive the row from assigning events as you row cell row cell may be impossible for reasons of ajax or other templates out of your the speed may not be worth turning your code into this sort of but sometimes this may make if none of these work for or return too performance it may be time to rethink the method you can assign an event listener higher up the tree and grab the events instead of you may want a faster if do some stuff way you do anything and the user actually requests

 many server applications not be your performance problem manifest only under concurrent access and under measuring absolute time a routine executes and trying to improve it is therefore not very there are problems with this method even in measuring absolute routine time relies on the clock the platform is and these are always very you better rely on average time a routine advice profiling to identify routines that execute the most times and take most tool like or to elaborate representative test simulate concurrent put your application under stress and measure throughput and average response this will give you a better idea of how your application is behaving as seen from the outside you could use unit tests to establish some non functional aspects of your i think that the approach given above will give better results during optimization when placing assertions in your unit tests you will have to choose some very approximative time can vary depending on the environment you are using to run your unit you want tests to fail only because some of your colleagues are using inferior is all about finding right things to you already have a functioning so placing performance related assertions and without establishing critical sections of code might lead you to waste a lot of time on optimizing pieces of your

 may be able to improve matters by building your list of keywords as a regular may allow them to be tested in but will very much depend on what the keywords are some work may be reused testing for and rather than searching every phrase from the start for each could do this by will actually return a match object on and none if not found this might be useful if you need to know which keyword how much this gains you will depend on the if you only have one or keep your current if you have a large it may be worth tring and profiling to see which performs how the approaches do for your good1 good2 good3 bad1 for this your approach performs far better than the regex whether this will always be the case depends a lot on the number and complexity of and the input data that will be for large numbers of and lengthy lists or rarely matching regexes may work but get timing and perhaps try even simpler optimisations moving the most common words to the front of your keyword sometimes the simplest approach really is the updated the table with and a similar approach before applying the i also added 2 new 500 1000 the first of which 500 1000 none of which show up the various strengths and joining does do worse when a match would immediately be found there is an always cost in joining the list this is a best possible case for the linear search however for it performs better when there are a large number of items in the

 may not directly answer your but i wanted to throw in what learned when using sprite sprite sheets are great because the fewer textures that the gpu has to switch between when drawing to the the better would recommend that you take a look at the sprite sheet if you it offers a couple great automatically packs your sprites different into one big i thought keeping my artwork in separate files and having the one giant sprite sheet generated automatically would be better than keeping all my art in one what if i decide i want my animations to have an extra frame in the then i have to shift around a bunch of stuff in the sprite sheet to make room for the new if using one file per just a one line change to the xml file listing what goes into the sprite sheet if i want to add a new frame in the can be a pain to list every frame file so i can see why this may not work for some but it was great for my i found that the gain of being able to swap textures in and out of my sprite sheet easily was more than worth which will help you as you determine what size of sprites to ran into a when scaling i believe that link describes the issue pretty in any this sprite sheet example will automatically add a 1 pixel border the color of the pixel that was originally on the around each sprite you add to the sprite which will protect you from seeing oddly colored borders around your sprites when because it still only draws the sprite using the original it just uses the extra border for interpolation instead of a nearby pixels or white is correct that there really any standard sprite size you should it depends mostly on what type of game you are what type of scaling and rotating you are there are specific sizes you need to watch for when using sprite sprite sheets are just one giant but there is a limit to how big of a texture can hold in their the xbox360 supports up to 4096x4096 if programming for then it depends on the graphics from what probably best to stick with 2048x2048 on because most graphics cards can support at least that last note on the sprite sheet i believe that it will watch for a maximum sprite sheet so if you do use you may want to add a couple lines to catch when the size of the generate texture is larger than you want to

 maybe it would make sense put the code in but there a way to put a handler at which i can close database issue is that you can never rely on these events to because the runtime decides whether they are fired or because they might not even be necessary and can be skipped to save a cancels the whole processing of a request by using a and the lifecycle events after that will not be fired at why for example there is no or something would consider moving your logic to a different layer of and maybe initialize the database when actually requested from a then you can close the database file within the same method that you needed the this would make you much more independent of the state the is sure if this is the info you were looking for though

 method would have advantages in extending orders with further as well as instrumenting changes but not recommend the is about collecting behaviours specific to distinct states in separate not about how to present stateful interfaces to other think about the business events which come naturally shipping invoice and design an explicit interface around exactly how you design the interface depends on how your application logic is and how it is used from other the classic answer is to define abstract methods for each business event if using you might decide to go with incoming and outgoing events from your order or you could try try some mixture or combination the main point is that a interface very and is likely to lead to a clumsy implementation methods in each of your orderstate a method internal to your classes from each of your specific methods or could be ok if you have a lot of code around the different state but i expose that as an external the drawback is that you may get some overlap between the methods of your internal iorderstate interface and the externally exposed order is a judgement but if i were go with your instinct not to expose the details of your state implementation to code that uses your order class should be readable and

 most basic case is your login controller simply handing a snapshot of the array to the other in this your login controller will need to have references to instances of the other and it will set some property of those instances to the remember to declare the properties with the so that the receivers hold on to your private mutable you want the other controllers to be able to modify the let them have your mutable an invitation to need to implement one property on the login instead of one property on each of the other the login property should have at least a getter and setter you can but you can implement specific accessor for you have this the other controllers should access the property in a if you implement the specific they can just use need to send to the login when they access the contents of that proxy they really access the login when they mutate the proxy they mutate the login array in comes the actual kvo want the other controllers to know when one of them the login changes the have each controller the login add itself as an observer of the property of the login remember to have them remove themselves in their order for the right notifications to get everything needs to use either accessors or that goes for the login controller should use its own accessors when mutating the instead of messaging the array the only exceptions are in and the accessor messages would be messages to a which will be a problem if you ever make the accessors it sounds like you may have way too many see if you of your logic into model objects that drastically simplifies your as cocoa is designed to work with a model being is fighting the which makes more work for i mean doing things other than or in addition to the normal behavior of a given accessor for normally just if you insert or store the object somewhere other than in an array in an instance or if you do something else in the same method as tell a view that it needs to then your accessor method is	
 most cases connection pooling problems are related to your application probably close its database connections correctly and when you leave connections they remain blocked until the garbage collector closes them for you by calling their want to make sure that you are closing the for example the following code will cause a connection if the code between and throws an myconnection new some correct way would be myconnection new somecall myconnection new your function a connection from a class make sure you cache it locally and call its leak a connection using this code for new connection returned from the first call to is not being instead of closing your this line creates a new one and tries to close you use sqldatareader or a close even though closing the connection itself seems to do the put in the extra effort to close your data reader objects explicitly when you use article does a connection pool from magazine explains a lot of details and suggests some debugging or these system stored procedures return information from the system table that shows the status of and information about all working see one server process id per if you named your connection by using the application name argument in the connection your working connections will be easy to sql server profiler with the sqlprofiler template to trace open if familiar with this method is easier than polling by using the performance monitor to monitor the pools and i discuss this method in a performance counters in you can monitor the health of your connection pool and the number of established connections by using routines to extract the counters or by using the new performancecounter	
 most effective data structure for a cache is an caches work if your data structure is laid out sequentially as cpus read entire cache lines 32 bytes or at once from main algorithm which accesses memory in random order trashes the caches because it always needs new cache lines to accomodate the randomly accessed on the other hand an which runs sequentially through an array is best gives the cpu a chance to speculatively put more memory into the which will be accessed this gives a huge performance a tight loop over a large array also allows the cpu to cache the code executing in the loop and in most cases allows you to execute an algorithm entirely from cache memory without having to block for external memory

 my opinion the code repository should only contain source code as well as third party libraries required to compile this source code the third party libraries might be retrieved with some dependency management tool during the build the resulting binaries should not get checked in along with the source think the problem in your case is that you have proper build scripts in why building a binary from the sources involves some work like starting up importing the adjusting there are build scripts in getting the binaries can be done with a command ant think the most important reason not to checkin the binaries along with the source is the resulting size of your this will repository and maybe too few space on versioning system of traffic between versioning system server and the update times you do an svn update from the reason might code is easily so lots of the features of a versioning system do make but you easily compare your approach as described above introduces a lot of overhead in my what if a developer forgets to update a corresponding jar	
 my own this is an apples to oranges although these macros are not a summary of how each p generates a compilation error if p generates a compilation error if latter despite double is especially useful because it can generate more informative error messages one uses nullary from or as is an example program that demonstrates how to use these namespace namespace a z boolean true false false syntax false syntax true false metafunction a z line a z line return here are the error messages my compiler visual generated for lines 19 and 21 error use of undefined type error cannot convert parameter 1 from to no constructor could take the source or constructor overload resolution was if using metafunctions defined as predicates then is both less verbose to code and more informative when it simple boolean is less verbose to code although its error messages may be less clear on your

 my previous question do i get weird results when reading an array of integers from a tcp i have come up with the following which seems to sort the code sample works well with a small number of array but once it becomes the data is corrupt toward the is the code to send the array of int over i i result this is the code to receive the array of result first few numbers are but further down the array the numbers start going completely at the when the numbers should look like they actually come out as this because using the wrong sending an array of int over why are only the first amount	
 my project i found a piece of code in which a method was getting called in initializer observed that there is a chance that the users of test2 might pass null to the since the pointer is used without validation there are chances of access triggered me to look into exception handling in initializers i found in one of the article that try can be used inside initializer i wrote small test program to test this class stores the unique id and returns the same with api int return int try catch cought void int ptest new test2 delete return code is getting compiled in do i need to make any changes to make it compile in vc in one of the article i found that using try in initializer list does not strictly confirms to in that how do we handle the exceptions in initializers list way of handling handling in initializer

 my the integrator or role really needs to be involved in this process unless everyone on the team are able to perform this this is a very rare usually you will find that developers are very good at developing but so great with and designers are great with but want to or are not educated enough to having someone that can crossover into both worlds and the is very integrator needs to coordinate the controls that are being developed with the design assets that are being created by the in our current we have 6 active developers and 2 designers from an outside i am the integrator for this project and i spend most of my day in expression the developers work primarily in vs creating controls that meet our product spec and the design shop is designing what the end product will look the designers are working in my job is to take the illustrator files and create control styles from them and then apply them to the controls developed by our development as we move towards blend 3 with native support for psd and ai this task becomes much is very helpful to create the for your application in a separate solution from the main trunk of the application and then merge your resourcedictionaries into the main app you can get the look and feel correct without getting too caught up in what could still be incomplete

 my understanding is that i create my deriving from the base control and i can write my own method is that when you you provide your own implementation of a base the best one of two things is an easy way to transform the output of the base method into the desired base class is using a strategy pattern or variant so that you simply provide an alternate implementation of the appropriate portion of the it sound like either of those is the case so you may have to write it from	
 my we have an architecture group that determines which technologies are people are welcome to read up on alternative technologies and make but at the end of the the architecture group that makes the this may seem it does ensure that all of the development groups are using the same or similar and moving from one group to the next is fairly as by having one group do all the you ensure that you waste time by having multiple groups duplicate the research

 my work we currently use version the way we have it we have a bunch of and it forces the following things to be true before a change can be full set of tests must have been tests must have development these seem like sensible but i heard of any way you can do this with any other version control not currently planning to but i would like to know how to do it in the future without using would be interested in vcs or that can do also interested in any to existing vcs that allow preferably open source it seems like the usual thing to do is have vcs continuous integration and running the tests is automated as part of the instead of as a separate if i understand that still you commit code that pass the just you get notified about it is that is there anything that would stop you from being able to it at version control programs can enforce running passing of tests before integration of

 my you use a relational database when any one of these criteria are data is structured as a hierarchy or a graph of arbitrary typical access pattern emphasizes reading over no requirement for hierarchies and graphs do not translate well to relational even with the assistance of proprietary extensions like chasing down trees is a mighty pain using databases add a lot of overhead for simple read transactional and referential integrity are but overkill for some so for a file metaphor is good you simply need a relational database with its query language if there are no unexpected queries if there are no suits asking questions like many blue widgets did we sell in on the east coast grouped by and there never will then can live free of

 need to parse an xml file and build a output from the the problem is that the xml is in a in that it has several levels of nested elements that represent some sort of data i need to build the records dynamically based on the deepest level of the some example xml and expected output are at the am most familiar so prefer to use that but i just wrap my head around a way to dynamically build the output record based on a dynamic node also we assume that the nested nodes will be x levels so just hardcoding each level a loop is there a way to parse the xml and build the output on the additional node names are all except the parent and detail info node depth is not so assume further levels than displayed in the sample can have multiple so you need to loop on each child to properly build each ideas input would be greatly output would look like sub plan group subgrp defrate a plana 100 b planb group1 100 b planb group2 suba 1 b planb group2 subb 200 xml build flat record from dynamic nested

 need to start with the understanding that linq is intended paradigm for querying all sorts of structured data declaratively with one tool think ring to rule them linq to sql is just the first implemented to query relational microsoft has a mixed message about relationship with i think the problem is that it has become understood as a substitute for other abstraction and it is now often seen as a way for programmers to avoid the need to become skilled at treats oop as what it and relational data as what it and expects you to do each properly on its own advantages and disadvantages of the two are open to but if you agree that computer science wizards have come up with something of an for structured data then probably want to move in this there is some indication that other software product providers are willing to play so it may not even end up being totally which would be a good

 no technical reason why it be but we are really more talking about a set of constants within a common if an the numerical value is generally the fruit are only describing a set of named we are saying that a variable of type fruit can take one of these four what the integer value of each one is really not as long as i only refer to them by it matter if the value representing apple is or languages do allow you to specify the value that should represent but really sometimes but not part of the core purpose with they are simply there to give you a set of related named constants without having to specify an integer id for enums are often used to specify optional flags that can be combined with bitwise that is trivial to implement if each value is represented by an integer you just have to pick an integer that uses the bit pattern you values be useful in this operations make much sense on

 not clear exactly what has in but suggest a few some of which may not be feasible due to other written this out pretty much as thought about it i think it helps to see the train of thought in as make it easier for you to do the same thing next you like my of course is inherently functional in that means that queries have for expect a method with a signature return a new sequence of user objects with extra rather than mutating the existing the only information currently appending is the so add a method in along the lines user whatever you need to create a clone of this user clone new return might even want to make fully immutable there are various strategies around such as the builder ask me if you want more the main thing is that created a new user which is a copy of the old but with the specified inner back to your currently got three methods but my is that only the first one needs to be and that the rest of the api actually need to expose the facebook it looks like your method is basically although probably line up the query in terms of given a sequence of local users and a collection of facebook left doing the actual mapping a straight clause is because it yield the local users which have a matching facebook we need some way of treating a user as if they were a facebook user without an essentially this is the null object can do that by coming up with a facebook user who has a null uid the object model allows adjust for however the user should actually be static readonly facebookuser nullfacebookuser new we actually want a of these because what static readonly nullfacebookusers we can simply this dummy entry to our real and do a normal inner note that this that the lookup of facebook users will always find a user for any facebook if not the need to revisit this and not use an inner include the user at the then do the join and project using var facebookusers return from user in join facebookuser in facebookusers equals select the full class would sealed class facebookmapper private static readonly nullfacebookusers public var facebookusers return from user in join facebookuser in facebookusers equals select private var uids u in where select return facebook users for uids using few points noted the inner join becomes problematic if a facebook uid might not be fetched as a valid we get problems if we have duplicate facebook users each local user would end up coming out replaces the avatar for second group see if we can address these assume that if fetched facebook users for a single facebook then it matter which of them we grab the avatar from they should be the we need is a group so that for each local user we get a sequence of matching facebook then use to make life can keep as it was before but this time only going to call it if got a facebook user to grab the avatar a group join in query expressions is represented by this query is reasonably but not too var facebookusers return from user in join facebookuser in facebookusers equals into let firstmatch select firstmatch null user the query expression but with sequence is just our local user in perform a group join the range variable now be a sequence of facebookusers with the right this could be facebookuser in facebookusers equals into convert an empty sequence into a single null and then take the element the first matching facebookuser or firstmatch if not got a return the original otherwise return a new copy with the appropriate firstmatch null user option is to only use linq very for var facebookusers var uiddictionary foreach user in facebookuser if out yield return yield return uses an iterator block instead of a linq query will throw an exception if it receives the same key twice one option to work around this is to change to make sure it only looks for distinct private var uids u in where select return facebook users for uids using assumes the web service works of course but if it you probably want to throw an exception anyway your pick out of the the group join is probably hardest to but behaves the iterator block solution is possibly the and should behave okay with the immutable would almost certainly be a positive step nice of all of these solutions is that the users come out in the same order they went that may well not be important to but it can be a nice this helps been an interesting question is mutation the way to seen in your comments that the local user type is actually an entity type from the entity it not be appropriate to take this course of making it immutable is pretty much out of the and i suspect that most uses of the type will the it may be worth changing your interface to make that instead of returning an implies to some extent you might want to change both the signature and the leaving you with something like sealed class facebookmerger public void var facebookusers var uiddictionary foreach user in facebookuser if out private var uids u in where select return facebook users for uids using this a particularly solution the main any more but as not really

 not expensive to construct a data context regardless of how many tables it so that be a criterion when deciding whether to have one or more separate data context a new data context is until you actually start using and table instances are created as makes a data context instance expensive is when you use the same instance over and over again for tracking changes to different objects for using a cached instance of a data context in an application for all database operations a long as you use the data context as in a it matter how many tables it can manage at the class definition as you only instantiate the ones you need within the current unit of the data context logically represents the target so it should represent all the entities that are mapped within that whether there are 10 or 100 splitting it up really offers no benefit other than less lines of code in a given but if something you care about then by all have different

 not got nothing to do with about decomposing a vector initial sequence of into a different just that this basis has a series of very useful orthogonal the vectors and determining the transformation back to the original basis is exceedingly the fourier basis vectors are eigenvectors of the shift circular for the discrete operation a basis after shifting the vector is still the same function a what makes convolutions and the solution of a large class of differential equations very simple in fourier and the entries are roots of unity this gives raise to the one of the most elegant algorithms ever reducing the operations required for a change of basis to n log

 not sure there is one there are so many variables to take into including how far down the development path you comments having been through both and auditing i hope you can see where you are now at terms of could affect these you need to map the user who changed the data you normally then db triggers will need to get this information not but more work and several ways to approach this user executing common user column in each you use db triggers and you rely on affected rows count returned from then your audit triggers need to have this turned or your existing code logic modified to expect db triggers offer more but they are not as anyone with appropriate access can disable the modify data and then enable them in other ensure your db security access rights are a single table for history is not a bad way to although you will have more work to do data to if you are auditing history for multiple especially when it comes to reconstructing the audit you also have to consider locking issues if there are many tables trying to write to one audit an audit history table for each table is the other you just need each column in the audit table to be as well as storing date and time of action and the user associated with the you go with the single table unless you have a lot of time to spend on get too fancy trying to audit only on updates or although it may be tempting to avoid inserts most apps do this more often than updates or reconstructing the audit history does take a fair bit of audit tables can get so have a strategy if they start affecting options include table partitioning onto different basically think about this now and not when it becomes a problem

 not that is that vast libraries and frameworks exist that can help you do your this is true for many programming look at cpan for for what language to use depends in great part on what your goals can start simple and work your way up to larger and larger is by no means too complex for a but learning any form of web programming is a lot to learn when all if you were looking at for the same there is a lot there you are doing ignore all of j2ee except for jsp and jms and a very few other the share of j2ee is only useful in the context of an enterprise application that needs to and in fact can be harmful when used in smaller frameworks such as web and so on help you do your but are yet more things to learn to do your there is a lot to you use quite a lot of development is done with lamp linux mysql with you need to worry about java or or any of those works very well for a wide class of and on the server are more appropriate for larger but once you are familiar with they work just fine for smaller services as have to decide what your exact goals then look at how people have implemented the kind of thing that looking at this will help you figure out what technologies are the most necessary for the niches looking at going

 nov 2011 a of what i say below is still true however i have now got serious reservations about recommending realbasic for anyone trying to release to save me remembering to edit this post see if realsoftware have managed to release a robust version of their ide using the cocoa version of their if be very with a heavy heart that i write this because i still really like the language and think the framework and ide are the problem is apparently one of and possibly a software development culture inside the company that consistently fails to deal with a bug regression many bugs are fixed each release but there appears to be a huge tax on the developers in the number of introduced they have a very small team for the complexity of the especially considering the newly released web edition which is effectively an entirely new still theoretically a great product but take advantage of the trial test it thoroughly on each of the platforms you plan to target and decide if you can live with any bugs you find because they may be there for a language is a modern oo language that be hard for you to adapt to from your vaguely remembered pascal or current it has most of the power of without the dangerous bits that make debugging a you will also find the ide simpler and easier to deal with than say visual ide makes it very easy to throw together a gui and have it just work on multiple the pro version has one of the best debuggers used and it is easy to just work on a mac and develop for windows and compiling and testing with one is also a thriving community including many people at your level of expertise so you be mocked for being a am a professional software developer with over 25 years experience and currently mainly working in and a bit of for apps such as you realbasic is my tool of i believe someone downvoted this but have the guts to add a comment explaining heard about prejudice against realbasic but this is the first time encountered in what way was my answer inappropriate for this to add to my used by systems deployed to tens of thousands of end users i have the experience to applaud someone else doing a good job and the realbasic frameworks are very

 nt file system does not delete a file when you think it when you delete a file on an nt file system the operating system simply marks the disk space that file occupied as the file will not be truly deleted until another file is written to that location on to why windows would think it was the same exact file i believe this is due to the fact that the file was empty when you deleted it so creating a new file in the same location with the same name and the same contents makes windows think it is in fact the same i would consider this to be a a side the fact that windows handles file deletes in this way is the very reason that you are able to use utilities to recover deleted

 number of pages required is integer pagesize is the number of labels to print and is the number of labels per starting index is irrelevant for the number of pages as long as you know how many labels you are going to if you print 25 labels it matter if the starting index is 4 or still 25 you want to use the index to optionally leave labels blank on the first print 19 labels from index 14 to index 14 15 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 31 32 you first calculate how many labels to leave blank before the first is the modulus you add these empty items to the number of labels to calculate the actual number of items to for the example above it would be 3 19 this would then be used in the calculation above to get the number of

 of most software developers i talk to have at least heard of d and have it mentally connected to basically those properties that you mentioned in your question fast the way should have been implemented in the first this for itself is a level of success that 99 percent of all programming languages created will never are some reasons though why not in the same league with language itself is a nicely done and sane but not different enough from other languages to really catch enough for a friendly really but not for i to use is no killer application that requires you to learn something that an average joe programmer wants to work with so badly that he goes through the hassle of picking up a new programming languages such as ruby and python have taken over some big chunks of the language making it harder for to find an corporate world is to a large extent java might get replaced as an application development language anytime soon but its successor will most probably run on the jvm because a pretty mature and stable piece of software with a large community and huge library most new such as are compatible with java one last but very subjective under the impression that the classical have fallen a little out of fashion in the part of the developer community that likes to check out new all that d looks really nice and seems to solve the problems it promises to solve in a solid and fast no reason why it find its

 of the best books is mentioned the series because it gives great analogies and are also other decent java design pattern books web sites that are specialized on the subject posts above for the of book was my first read on this it is my opinion that you should avoid it especially if your starting at the time this was the but today many books exist giving you many to choose and i clearly emphasize this practice is the ultimate learning after having read several books on the i was certain of knowing and understanding these when i attempted to actually implement some of them i soon realized that my knowledge was mostly and my comprehension even a huge blow to my set out to test and challenge my peers and quickly learned that they were in the same boat as i i find that of programmers proclaim to know patterns but when really put to the only about actual know the subject set out to implement as many patterns as i could in one or more complex i put theory to practiced and what i learned was a gold of the most challenging aspects of my experience was that each pattern alone look but sometimes linking a bunch of patterns together can be even more encourage you to put theory to

 of the documentation for me clean up your code and explain it piece by do do puts array of symbols to strings by using you get this array of strings into any of the items which match the regexp will get fed to the block prints out the upcased string that it got block returns the upcased which grep then takes as the return value from grep is an array of all the gets assigned to it is because that was the only thing that matched the then gets doing a on an array just prints all the elements this very better off printing answer your question about how grep works behind the above documentation page shows the c source for grep it basically does a new ruby array to walk over each element in the passing some code is also used by and a bunch of other we know how all we need to do any more spelunking in the source we have our and your explain in more it does a new array to hold return the next item from the it matches the a block was call the and whatever the block put it in the return a block was not put the item in the return repeat until no more items in the to your comment of seems to make a lot more i idea is that the block does something with if it scanned the source and then passed the array of matches to the your block would then have to call which would be it would be less what happens for if your block calls or raises an in current you avoid having to scan the rest of the if it had already scanned the entire source list have wasted all this

 of the physical write to disk is the bottle neck by some orders of and it is in most scenarios rather parallelizing writes you have good chances to performance by incurring sequential reads and writes will largely outperform interleaving n most parallelization and mainly work by reducing the seeks that are naturally required when different clients concurrently request data from different sections of the if you can avoid these seeks in the first you are better some scenarios raid jbod or when different streams of data arrive rather slowly the right scheduling can improve your but that requires intimate knowledge of the hardware at and other processes not spoiling your you can leave that as a decision to the end user give an option to turn it and provide performance measures to guide might even prove me wrong	
 of the point opposed it is illegal to convert a to a const for reasons explained your main problem is that the test you are expecting to fail when reached the empty string at the end of the animals is that statement is actually checking if the pointer which points to the string is not checking if the string is an empty string string containing the single character is not the same as a null other once reached the last element of the animals evaluates to a pointer which happens to point to a string that is therefore the test and your loop continues forever it continues until you run far enough past the end of the animals array that it causes a can fix this either by replacing with null when you create the animals or you can change the while check to check 0 any other way of checking for an empty string instead of a null note that others pointed out equally serious problems that i

 of this question have been asked namely and solutions seem to boil down to two reflection to figure out calling the case of console a call to console in a and see if it fails own recommendation is to have your library export an the interface has a function or property that return the type of the the calling object has a class that implements the interface and return what type it because complexity is a concern you can control that somewhat by what you place in the a application register itself with the library then you can try throwing an error or trying some scheme of automatic using an interface and throwing an error you are making it explicit to the programmer using the library what exactly you the interaction between the two is defined by the addition the interaction is more flexible than a automatic scheme because as the get to choose how my calling binary interacts with your library rather than some mysterious set of

 of usual concurrent in any using any abstraction is and and has many take into programming complicates any application by critical sections is and sometimes bugs originating in concurrent code is and much dependent on os concurrent has gone a long way in making concurrent programming as easy as possible for for most you will see that has most of the abstractions you will interface and object you can just throw in your code and you have a thread ready to nice set of constant dynamic or just throw a at it and it does the and of all sorts relieve you of needing to implement common locking and api for all only thing left for as the software is to ensure you are writing meaning you should be aware of the dangerous situations you might be exposing yourself a situation in which two or more threads are waiting on unordered rendering an infinite waiting two or more threads which politely try to give way to the other on a shared resource but end up not taking it two people in a corridor walking up to each other and constantly moving together from side to a single thread taking up most or all of a single shared thus depriving other threads from access to point when to threads only when concurrency will directly improve your applications you are waiting on an spawn a thread on it so you can continue doing other you are just trying to elegantly split use you just might end up worsening your you do use make sure you have thoroughly contemplated the and you did not miss any exceptional way to get into things is to do the concurrency other than get a good luck

 of what you do in programming all day is combining some functions together to build bigger functions from usually you have not only functions in your toolbox but also other things like variable assignments and the but generally your program combines together lots of to bigger computations that will be combined together monad is some way to do this of your most basic to combine two computations together is you say this you mean do then do the result is basically again a computation that can be combined together with more is a simple it is a way of combing small computations to bigger the says the thing on the then do the thing on the thing that can be seen as a monad in object oriented languages is the often you find things like basically means the computation on the and then call the method on the right on the result of it is another way to combine a little more complicated than and the concept of chaining things together with is a since a way of combining two computations together to a new fairly common that has no special is this return return return return value of indicates but there is no real way to abstract out this error even if you have lots of that you need to combine in this this is basically just another monad that combines the function calls by the rule the function on the left returned do return otherwise call the function on the if we had an operator that did this thing we could simply would make things more readable and help to abstract out our special way of combining so that we need to repeat ourselves over and over there are many more ways to combine that are useful as a general pattern and can be abstracted in a enabling the user of the monad to write much more concise and clear since all the and management of the used functions is done in the example the above could be extended to the error checking and then call the right side on the socket that we got as so that we need to explicitly specify lots of formal definition is a bit more complicated since you have to worry about how to get the result of one function as an input to the next if that function needs that input and since you want to make sure that the functions you combine fit into the way you try to combine them in your but the basic concept is just that you formalize different ways to combine functions

 one of the main things you can do in a dvcs like git that work well in svn is the create several development branches off of trunk for various features that are under merge code from one feature branch into another feature branch before either feature branch is finished and ready to be merged into merge the feature branches into nice to break new features off into separate branches so that trunk stays clean until the features are inevitably you run into a situation where a team working on one feature branch has written some code that is needed by a team on another feature if you merge this code across feature branches with have trouble merging into trunk later git avoids this another your company decides to outsource development of a feature to an indian contracting your professional services group needs to add a feature for a and that feature may be productized in the you really want to give write access to your svn to the indian contractor or your ps they have to build the code outside of source and you have to merge it in detecting and resolving any conflicts yourself without any help from and losing all of the history in the with you just give the contractor or your ps group a copy of the and they can commit to it just like a you can use features to merge the changes back into your git git will find the and it will preserve one of the coolest things about git is that you really have to convince your friend that better than because git integrates so well with your can happily use svn while you happily use a git connected to the

 one so i is not really a property of a file format files are binary after but rather of a file format and viewer app called human readable formats are all based on top of additional abstraction layer of one of existing text and viewer programs also serving as an that are capable of rendering these encodings in a form readable by humans are very encoding standards are widespread and fairly which means unlikely to evolve much in the foreseeable on top of the text encoding layer of the format we find a syntax layer that is reasonably intuitive given target user knowledge and cultural the benefits of of suitable viewers and that cultural conventions change read and on the extra abstraction layer makes text encoded to files do not resort to text encoding abstraction layer as a base a common but they might or might not use some sort of an extra abstraction more suitable for their purpose and they can be much better optimised for a specific task at hand the other and editors are specific for a particular binary format and make interoperability for any given format are less wide because they are more might evolve significantly or go out of use over their main benefit in being very well suited for a particular task and as the task or task requirements so does the	
 one thing is bugging me about the idea of a as mentioned is that you still have a valid variable containing an but the type is being this seems allowable since we can still work with the address data the type is somewhat superfluous less in this dereferencing it is because to try and a make sense we know what class to refer and thus the memory to jump the vtable pointers to then seem to make sense that on its own would be ok since only refer to the but none of its no class information is needed to do just the i understand absolutely no use for but important in defining when things break allowing this a reference dereferenced but not accessing ref also makes and thus would allow void not saying anyone should take it up with those in but from a point of seem luc touraille pointed out above this is my it could be but the issue is a semantic the reasonable explanation i could come to was that since an object variable is a for a sequence of the type is of important semantic the being thought of as a variable with an address treats the type as somewhat superfluous not key to defining anyone agree with

 only for this scenario you programatically redirect to then why not put something on the querystring to say where the redirect came this would be more likely to work across muliple browser types and advantage to this approach is that be able to tell the difference between a redirect to and a direct link via a link on one of your or from the user entering the url into the address to page referrer is something the the client provides as part of the http as you rely on the this question is your comments not clear an easy solution other than all your i suspect that global might be your best more if you use fiddler any other http debugging you should be able to see that the referrer header being populated when you perform a for this is the result of a redirect an http 302 response causing ie to redirect to another msie windows nt clr media center pc clr clr clr lm zune is the http request that is generated by clicking the link on msie windows nt clr media center pc clr clr clr lm zune can see that the generated by a link on a generates the referer

 option that i was thinking using is create an error then i would need to pass it from to business layer and the then to access layer by am not sure i understand you have to pass the error object in every for in one of your that inform the user that something like this already exists in the database name not unique for a sql exception could be thrown by the and you just need to catch the specific exception in your business or ui handling block by the enterprise library suggested by other people will allow you define some exception handling in your it could be good place if you want to develop some enterprise but for simple you may need not go that	
 option that should be noted is through	
 option would be to use unsafe fixing the array in memory and use pointer i doubt the speed increase will be that dramatic how are you if you are using datetime then be aware that this class has poor you should add an outer loop and repeat the operation say ten times i bet the result is less than outer outer for x x for y y

 original code would benefit from using multiple return statements there is no need to hop around the error return clean up you normally need the allocated space released on an ordinary return too otherwise you are leaking and you can rewrite the example without if you are this is a case where you can usefully declare variables before otherwise char char char if 0 0 use p3 there are amounts of work after each allocation then you can use a label before the first of the and a is ok error handling is the main reason for using these and anything much else is somewhat look after some code which does have macros with embedded goto it is confusing on first encounter to see a label that is by the visible yet that cannot be i prefer to avoid such macros are ok when i need to know what they do they just do macros are not so ok when you have to know what they expand to to use them if they hide information from they are more of a nuisance than a names disguised to protect the rerrcheck if if else goto else are several dozen variants on that are somewhat similar different sizes and different loader place where these are used contains this loop in a larger block of code in a single case of a large switch with some small and some big blocks of code particularly well for 0 i obvious that the code there is laced with goto and a full exegesis of the sins of the code it comes from would take all day they are many and

 out this for discussion related to what you are asking when you normally click on a link on the page the browser makes a request to the server to get the next just like there is a lot of pushing towards semantically relevant css it is also important that your page requests are semantically the problem with using links to remove items is that it is making a request to something in the from this comes the problem that some search engines might index your links and accidentally erase there also comes the problem of request which can make an unsuspecting user make a command to a website without being so the proper way to handle this is by following the rule that request that modifies state in the server should be processed via as instead of doing url is better to do url you would like to keep your links while maintaining the have to resort to return but for the your django view would then do something like if remove as scott django has some built in stuff to help you avoid the request forgeries i mentioned since it is still possible to do it even if you are doing a post slightly the way to avoid this is to have some kind of token tied to the form that needs to be validated server side before allowing the action to be check out the class for more details on it will essentially automate some of that work out of it for and the use of http get and safe http rfc of the world wide volume post with a regular request forgeries and

 personal preference is to focus on making it visible that the type is for instance i would call it immutablelayer or if for some reason immutable is not a good word to prefix the name with i will add an attribute to the class indicating immutable is added in both has ups and the up is it gives a central place to check for just take a quick peek and the type and in there is no need to learn new method names or the downside to the approach is that you tell in certain type infererence scenarios that the value is for this code works just as well for an immutablecollection and a normal col i do not like to change method names to accomidate the reason being that it is a problem you will have to solve naming things should be but incredibly difficult some think of all of the types ever wanted to make imagine having to find new names or conventions for every mutating method on those a task and you will spend a lot of time educating users on those new dream scenario though is to find a way to increase the visiblity of immutable because the real problem not knowing the type is currently there is no good way to do this for all but hopeful for the next version of the languages

 point in is to keep the two classes separate so that if there are code changes in your class nothing would have to be change in the other i think that the static inner classes you are talking about could potentially make maintaining code a one change in searchcriteria could send you searching through all of the static classes to figure out which ones are now broken because of the i would stay away from any such inner classes unless it is really needed for some

 point numbers should be used for what they were designed computations where what you want is a fixed and you only care that your answer is accurate to within a certain if you need an exact answer in all best using something are three domains where you might use floating apps require a lot of number and often use sophisticated numerical methods to solve systems of differential typically talking floating point of games as a simulation where ok to if the physics is to seem real then ok for and you can make up in user experience what missing in terms of games usually use floating science statistical methods need a lot of floating a lot of the numerical methods are the the application domain is just you find a lot of statistics and monte carlo simulations in financial applications and in any field where analyzing a lot of survey point and for most business applications you really need to know all these fine just knowing that you represent some decimal numbers exactly in floating and that you should be sure to use some decimal type for prices and things like you really want to get into the details and understand all the tradeoffs and check out the classic every programmer should know about floating or pick up a book on or numerical linear if really

 probably a good idea to keep the concepts is a and it specify anything about what platform should be in straight code could be compiled to native x86 java msil or anything else you care to think i believe adobe recently made a compiler which generates flash with typical microsoft has created two languages targeting they made the extensions for then they decided it ditched it and tried to pretend it never their best bet for is called but is not it extends and changes the language in a number of nonstandard i believe the standard committee requested that they change the name to avoid but they studio 2005 and newer supports listed under visual think it was that did microsoft has done it after specifying which is actually a reasonably attempt at integrating with they realized that virtually no one uses out that even programmers generally prefer to use when working in and native focusing on making interop between and simpler and more likely to go it and in some cases just not the they originally hoped studio also supports native compiled to x86 machine untainted by these are listed in the dialog under visual if you want to learn you have two which limits you to a language which generates msil instead of native machine and requires to and generally worth the bother because if going to take a dependency on why not write in learn proper which is completely separate from and directly reference key takeaway point is that separate either you compile as which means the compiler will allow you to reference and will generate msil or you compile as in which case the world a note of despite my wording above and by in many it is not faster has the to be but it depends a lot more on the compiler will turn pretty much anything into reasonably efficient on the other is full of pitfalls that will make your code than the equivalent and the blog posts it references are worth a read for anyone curious about the performance of similar code written in the two is only one area where applications will be consistently and in startup a application may have to load the framework and jit the msil where a native just other than it is probably a mistake to assume that will be it because it gives you a bit more but that just means the compiler is less able to save you from the inefficiencies you create in your

 problem i see with the method is the location where drawing the my understanding is that each sprite in your game is a separate the graphics object being passed in the paintcomponent method different for each you can imagine a graphics object as a painting if you only had 1 graphics object for the entire and this graphics object represented the entire game then your logic would be correct and everything should each sprite here has its own graphics presumably with height and width relevant to the in this your paintcomponent method would probably just look void if always at because with your moving the and graphics around the game the coordinates you pass to are relative to the graphics you always want to start painting in the hand of the getting just a gray square because trying to draw the image way out of bounds of the graphics the long i think this approach is going to work because not that easy to move jpanels around inside of their parent containers using absolute not really scalable either because jpanels are pretty heavyweight and take a lot of resources to create and are probably better of having a single jpanel that represents the entire game each sprite be a subclass of so you have a paintcomponent you could do something like class gamearea extends private final sprites to public void sprite class sprite no need to extend your other code looks ok public void

 problem is that the conversion tools offer support for the vb6 graphics commands or the vb6 printer plus you get into a lot of corner cases when dealing with activex i know our own applications translate over with any conversion tools as a lot of tweaks are built into the ui to make it work smoothly with the vb6 form are things that conversion tools fail on as the winform engine requires own the same thing was experienced when our software moved from dos to sometimes there is no substitution for manual that being there are somethings you can do to make conversion considerably first make sure your application is built in this way you can convert one layer at a test and continue it also has the advantage of leaving you with usable software at every i recommend starting at the top layer and working your way sure anything that is vb6 centric and not basic centric is behind an when first came out several years ago i created a canvas interface and implemented that using the vb6 graphics i use the same canvas interface in except now it uses the graphics the same was done for all the code was moved out of our forms into classes that the forms the forms themselves implement an interface that the ui classes when we switched to we have a precise definition of how the form interacted with the rest of the system and form conversion was considerably of these steps where done in vb6 and put through our normal release then afterward we started the

 problem is worse than the previous two answers you know what to sound so but where did you ever see something like and what did it mean or what do you even want that to figure out what you want to create a class that can represent add a property of that class to the server you may have to add a typeconverter or other designer support in order for to convert your preferred textual representation into an instance of the be able to get something like the properties of a going to make a guess about what some of these values and try to show you how to deal with them in a my guess could be far work with assume this applies to the domain of automobile and that the color property is meant to represent the finish given to the car as a in that would probably be an referring to the type of finish i know what other sorts of finish apply to a i know from building model cars when i was a kid that paints may be or or so those three would be enum values of one would be one of many this would give something like enum notpaint enum enum class public finishtype finishtype public paintfinish paintfinish public carcolor carcolor class car public carfinish color would allow for something like

 providing more insight on the suggestions already reference to on codeproject makes use of web service for inferring location from a cell tower id in addition to the gps hardware in the phone if it is assumed that google has wide coverage on cell tower ids making the method perceivably the downside of this method is that it clear what view is on some one making use of the possible dispositions could include against this functionality being used by other programs encouraging developers to use the functionality or apathy not retricting use of it but not supporting use of it the danger of the apathy disposition is that at some point in the far future google could change the interface to the service without if you intend to make a program for commercial reasons then you will really want to get clarity on skyhook wireless service is extremely apple uses skyhook wireless for their wifi location in the iphone and as of a couple of months ago skyhook expanded upon the service so that instead of only doing wifi based location on windows mobile phones it will now use and cell tower the downside of this service is if you plan on using it commercially you will need to consider using this sdk from a managed application was initially a pain because of limitations in the interop abilities of the compact i managed to make a wrapper and posted it to the skyhook wireless discussion based few months ago there was an msdn article on location based for more information see the article and example code at noise was an msdn magazine code example from a few years ago that demonstrated how to automatically adjust your volume based on the ambient noise for more details see

 put your code into a test page and to be perfectly even with thirty or so divs it seemed ok certainly responsive enough to use from my sliding the mouse over a bunch of them means i have to wait for the rollover effect to go through them all which takes a while until it gets to the one actually stopped but surely that was what you wanted given that using rather than would certainly remove any speed not using actual images in my test just getting the alt so my best current guess would be to make sure all images loading are as small filesize as you can possibly make

 question is essentially a restatement of other in a the advantage of an auto increment field is that the value is guaranteed the disadvantage is that the value exist until the insert has already been is the you for retrieve for a given table what the next auto increment value will but because of concurrency you be sure that the query execute next will be the one that gets that someone else might take it the assignment of the id field has to an atomic operation that happens as the record is being other though you may to do this in a single simply not going a way you could theoretically pretend that only executing one query by attaching a trigger on insert that adds your alternate representation of the id field after the you can use a id field based on something known ahead of

 question is poorly phrased at least the title because it implies this difference is endemic and holds true for all instances of the body of the question is better phrased because it presents a reasonably detailed explanation of the sort of thing your code is it state what versions of runtimes you are nor does it state the target architecture or machine the code will run these things make big have done some this is some as to why you see the results you as good at writing performant code as you are at is not a or even likely but it is a real possibility you should versions of the jvm have some serious optimizations to make uncontended locks extremely this may skew things in your favour especially the comparison with the c implementation threading primitives you are the java code seems to run well compared to the c code it is likely that you are not terribly dependent on the heap allocation strategy would tell you the code runs less well than the java one assuming the code is then several possible reasons are using virtual functions which the jvm will inline but the clr will latest jvm does which may make some code paths considerably more efficient those involving string manipulation whose lifetime is stack the very latest 32 bit clr will inline methods involving non primitive jvm jit compilers use hotspot style mechanisms which attempt to detect the of the code and spend more effort an understanding of what your code spends most of its time doing it is impossible to make specific i can quite easily write code which performs much better under the clr due to use of structs over objects or by targeting runtime specific features of the clr like non boxed this is hardly instructive as a general

 quick answer here is it absolutely should not crash just because you are mixing printf and the only difficulty with mixing the two is that the respective output buffers will not be synced by so the order of the output may be a bit mixed but it definitely should not a quick perhaps you have a formatting problem with printf passing a double when it expects a short or something like that will lead to unpredictable which might well shift depending on the order of function calls in your

 quite often useful to do thread dumps of production servers to determine causes of in this case usually going to be a large amount of threads in different in a java application you could be looking at quartz threads and possibly different thread pools that an application uses to establish performance arguably the thread pool name is usually more important than the actual thread but the individual thread names can also be significant if trying to identify a deadlocked since the threads usually have a name indicating its it helps to understand going

 quote difference between and interpreters is that the latter restate language features in terms of the features instead of actually implementing in other hence the they depend on their host environment to give the features one of the key features of a language that allows interpreters to be written for them is that that the primary representation of the program is a primitive datastructure of the language lisp exhibits this by virtue of the fact that programs are themselves expressed as

 ran into this same problem because i wanted to convert between local and utc in a query that was being utilized by reporting i went through what seems to be the same exact struggles you are going through with my started out writing a stand alone app that went through the timezoneinfo object and wrote entries to a timezoneinfo table in my i stored all the offsets daylight savings for every year between a start year and end year were arguments to the stand alone this i was then able to create some sql functions that would take a date in utc or local and the use the timezoneinfo lookup table to get the right offset for the right time of year and and return the datetime converted to utc or i still done i had to create a clr function that returned the current timezone of the system using a library that was safe for sql server the timezoneinfo i have access to my code at the but i beleive i used the timezone i had a clr function that returned the time an app that produced a timezone look up table with dls specific information for a range of i topped it all off with a stored procedure that took in a timezone and a date to convert and its been working beautifully understand this is a huge work around to do something that seemed quite but it got the job done in a safe	
 rarely find myself writing any within a unless an anonymous inner you write nested class private enum public void think really want to a method which declared a new type within it do you have any concrete reason for wanting to declare it inside the method instead of just as a nested i can see the other methods need to but i think a comment can sort that out and still leave more readable

 rather ugly solution that may or may not be practical is to leverage an existing regex diagnostics some regex libraries have the ability to figure out where the regex failed to in this you use what is in effect a form of brute but using one character at a time and trying to get longer strings until you got a full this is a very ugly unlike a standard brute force it failure on a string like ab will also tell you whether there exists a string which will match stop and try if try a longer this is probably not feasible with all regex the bright this kind of solution is probably pretty cool from a teaching in practice probably similar in effect to a dfa but without the requirement to think about that you want to use random strings with this you can use random characters to start with if you keep track of what tested in a so the effect is the

 read this article and thought of it when seeing your hope it a primitive polynomial over one can obtain another primitive polynomial by decimating an lfsr sequence obtained from the initial this is demonstrated in the code c in order to generate an lfsr we must first multiply this polynomial by a suitable constant so that the trailing coefficient becomes c we are now able to generate an lfsr sequence of length 72 the initial state can be anything other than lfsrsequence 5 we decimate the sequence by a value d having the property 6 b to get the corresponding primitive we multiply by a constant to make it b

 realize there have already been a number of posts on design and this could possibly be me over thinking things and going round in but i have myself all confused now and would like to get some clarity from the community am trying to separate a project i design architecturally very well to start out into different layers in their own should only call the logic layer to get its should not call or have references to anything just be a way of storing the layer should hold all of the methods to delete objects in the system and would have references to both the bo and the it would apply the business logic to the operations then delegate the actual crud to the would just do the crud operations on the it would have a reference to the as it would return them for the gets question is should the logic classes only call their equivalent dal class and just call logic classes in other class should only call so if it wanted to get a client object by id it would call rather than the reason i thought it maybe should stay on the its own layer was would seem to loosen the coupling between about the if getting a client object had some logic validation in it not the best but hope it gets the point am not sure if it is bad design by me but at the moment the business layer has a number of classes including clientbull and both classes have a call to one i use an interface for each class and have a factory to build the objects to try and reduce any coupling but they can not exist without each other now due to calling methods in both is this a bad architecture design seperation of

 really depends on what you want to in my experience something small hand made on top of webob is really good for an but for full fledged sites that need django is hard to into account that if you huge frameworks django the first request always takes around 3 seconds to load everything in memory and keeps it there until 15 secs after that while you shop around for frameworks take into account apply to the platform so basically templates be fast even as they use c might be the most important thing to make everything	
 really depends on who notionally the disposable in some you may want to be able to pass in the for instance in the without your class taking responsibility for cleaning it other times you may want to clean it up if creating the object in your sample then it should almost certainly be your responsibility to clean it for the property i think having a property should really transfer ownership or anything like if your type is responsible for disposing of the it should keep that	
 really enjoy database design and the whole concept of managing data semantically and all the logic that comes with knowledge level when it comes to databases is however would quite basic i can model data relationships correctly with er connection handling etc experienced when it comes to programming in and i figure my database knowledge is like knowing the basics of object oriented how to model a inheriting from the vehicle containing wheel objects and so i would like to further my knowledge about relational databases so that i may confidently say to an employer that i can handle the subject on a professional i can handle right now is probably my movie database in the back end of my personal which probably would collapse if i was amazon and had to store millions of so the subject of scalability sure a pretty array of within database design that you simply must understand and be able to apply in real life if going to work with databases on a professional i would be very grateful if any database gurus in the field could namedrop some case studies or anything that would be beneficial to study to get really good at sure a vast science lurking and i want in databases there has to be more

 really like the concept of modular bundles as implemented by also like services like google appengine web or java webstart client two ideas seem to complement rather well the osgi standard includes a couple of features that make it impossible for implementations like felix or equinox to run on top of sandboxed virtual such as appengine or in these it is not possible to get direct access to a file for which precludes the osgi bundle cache that is used to store persistent bundle state and native i have no great interest in using native libraries or have persistent bundle is there some framework that implements the core bundle and services concept of osgi in a compatible way so that osgi bundles can be deployed into it as but can work without a bundle cache other facilities not available in a am looking for something like a limited version of felix that works on appengine or if the webstart engine and the google appengine just provided osgi framework services that would be another very limiting aspect of appengine is that you cannot start new this prevents other asynchronous bundle obviously not an issue with that can run in a sandbox appengine or

 reason for disliking properties is because they look like fields so developers who understand the difference will treat them as if assuming that be cheap to execute i disagree with him on this particular point i find properties make the client code much simpler to read than the equivalent method i agree that developers need to know that properties are basically methods in disguise but i think that educating developers about that is better than making code harder to read using having seen java code with several getters and setters being called in the same i know that the equivalent code would be a lot simpler to the law of demeter is all very well in but sometimes really is the right thing to automatically implemented properties really change any of is slightly like the arguments against using extension methods i can understand the but the practical benefit used outweighs the downside in my

 reason this particular exception gets thrown is that the content of the element gets applied to the items so the xaml initialises the listview with a single in its items but when using an itemscontrol you must use either the items property or the itemssource you use both at the same hence when the itemssource attribute gets processed an exception is can find out which property the content of an element will get applied to by looking for the contentpropertyattribute on the in this case higher in the class on the intention here was that the view be set to a so the fix is to explicitly indicate the property to be the xaml and the exception goes was missing that	
 reason to use openid is a user utilizes a third party openid provider then a malicious employee of the provider who had access obtain the login info and exploit the ran into this scenario when designing an application for managing a vital service for a openid was very attractive as the users were already familiar with the external services has a gmail or yahoo it the downside was that any exploit resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost solution was to implement one additional layer of security that was transparent to the user and unexploitable by the openid the login screen could only be accessed from within the

 reason you are warned away from static methods is that using them forfeits one of the advantages of objects are intended for data this prevents unexpected side effects from happening which avoids static methods have no encapsulated and so garner this if you have no use of internal they are fine to use and slightly faster to make sure you touching global data in them languages also have variables which would allow for encapsulation of data and static

 recently did some work modifying a python gui app that was using wxpython experimented with python in fits and starts over last six or seven but this was the first time i did any work with a i was pretty disappointed at what seems to be the current state of gui programming with i like the python language itself a a fun change from the programming used definitely a big productivity increase for general purpose programming like to move to python for wxpython is a huge step backwards from something like vcl or while python itself offers nice productivity gains from generally programming a higher level of wxpython is used at a way lower level of abstraction than the for i wasted a lot fo time trying to get a wxpython list object to behave the way i wanted it just to add sortable columns involved several one to create and maintain a that provided the actual sort another to make it possible to show in the column and there were a couple more i all of these error prone steps could be accomplished simply by setting a property value using my delphi grid while python provides big productivity gains by raising level of abstraction for a lot of general purpose wxpython is several levels of abstraction than the gui tools available for net gui programming with delphi is way faster than gui programming with and the resulting ui with delphi is still more polished and it seem to me like exaggerating to say that delphi gui programming was more advanced back in 1995 than python gui programming with wxpython is in did some investigating of other python gui frameworks and it look like any were substantially better than i also did some minimal investigation of gui formbuilders for which would have made things a little bit but by most reports those solutions are buggy and even a great formbuilder address my main complaints about which are simply that it has fewer features and generally requires you to do gui programming at a much lower level of abstraction than used to with some quick investigating into suggested python solutions is honestly somewhat depressing for someone used to delphi or got a couple of am i missing is there some solution for python that can compare with vcl or winforms i necessarily care if it quite measure up to just looking for something in the same could ironpython be the direction to mostly tried to avoid drinking the but maybe ironpython gives me a reason to finally give even does ironpython fully integrate with or would i need to have the forms themselves be backed by or it looks to me like that definitely is the case with sharpdevelop and monodevelop ironpython be used to do gui does fully integrate ironpython with really seems to me like python could over the in a way similar to the way that visual basic did back in the early if some wonderful new solution came out for only this time with python have a whole new paradigm of cross and gui corporations eat that i web apps are the main focus of things these so a great solution create same revolution that vb once but i see gui programming disappearing and like a nice open high level current state of gui programming with

 recommendation to start with xsd is a good that will not guarantee compatibility on each as xml schema is really big and no web services stack supports all of start with but confine yourself to mainstream complextypes composed of arrays of you can safely nest complextypes and of complextypes that contain arrays or away from substitution and any other xsd even xsd enumerations should be not enough to use a nullable there are formatting concerns as the datetime is a higher resolution quantity than a java calendar and as a shipping a time to java can result in exceptions on the java using the decorator in the xmlelement attribute on the side can make sure you serialize old on it is not true that you cannot use xml doc on the classes that get with partial you can write separate code from the generated classes with the doc you even if you the your partial class code will remain when you the doc will appear on the someone if using is not enough to guarantee why use my it is not a guarantee but it is a good it it keeps you away from designing interfaces in code java or or that expose things like generic java all of which present interop there are still pitfalls in the more marginal parts of but you can usually avoid those with thoughtful should have mentioned in my original answer that you can apply an iterative process to the development of the design in then generate stub and skeleton code from the then adjust and do it

 say one big reason and that you can work on a code change you do from a small quick fix to a big new will be an issue in or or the one you means the tracking system must be easy to simple and so otherwise developers will hate associate every change to the and you get full traceability for diff miss it if you have better project better release management and so can link each on your scm to a if your scm can do create a branch for each which is even what you get is every change will be or at least linked to the right you use you can promote things always working on stable reducing mainline corruption making it if you deciding which tasks integrate and which ones hold until the next individually run tests on changes before and so

 second answer about using an they are very efficient and simple to implement even in software and are guaranteed not to repeat in uses for an lfsr with an are some drawbacks by observing a small number of outputs from the one can reconstruct the lfsr and predict all values it will making them not usable for cryptography and anywhere were a good rng is the second problem is that either the all zero word or the all one terms of word is invalid depending on the lfsr the third issue which is relevant to your question is that the maximum number generated by the lfsr is always a power of 2 1 power of 2 first drawback might not be an issue depending on your from the example you it seems that you are not expecting zero to be among the the second issue does not seem relevant to your maximum value thus problem can solved by reusing the lfsr until you get a number within your an you want to have numbers between 1 and 10 in your you would use a lfsr which has a range a pseudo code as to how to get number in the range x should embed the previous code in your so that the caller care about that this would slow down your rng if you use a large and the maximum number you want is not a power of 2

 see the look at that top line in its script an html parser comes along and sees the opening inside normal parsing is disabled sgml the element has cdata to find where the script block the html parser looks for the matching first one it finds is the one inside the string an html parser know that inside a string because html parsers know anything about javascript they only know about so what you are actually saying an unclosed string literal and an unfinished function these result in javascript errors and the desired script tag is never common attempt to solve the problem is still technically wrong this is because in the character sequence that ends a cdata element is not actually but just sequence that is still present in the line browsers generally are more forgiving and in practice will allow the best solution is to escape the there are a few but the simplest is to use javascript string literal escapes above escapes all and which not only stops the sequence appearing in the but also allows it to be inserted into an xhtml script block without causing no such thing as a cdata so these characters would have the same meaning as if included in normal and a string inside a script block would actually create a nested script possible to allow in an xhtml script block by using a but a bit ugly and usually better to avoid using those characters in inline	
 see the problem in my copy of safari 4 though not exactly sure what issue you would be having since the sidebar on the right is empty and so not sure how i could tell if its being perhaps you should clarify about the exact problem that order to debug the and either solve it yourself or ask a more specific you should try to strip the problem down to the minimal example necessary to see the remove all of the content and structure that is not relevant to the and ensure the problem still remove all of the css that is not relevant to the and ensure that the problem still then you should have a simple with no more than about 10 lines each of html and if you strip it down far you may find your problem in the process removing one of the lines of css makes your problem go then found the and if not the have something that someone else will be able to give you better advice on without having to wade through all of the extraneous you are still having trouble figuring out going you should try the web inspector in in safari 4 you can go to the and choose develop menu in menu i recall when exactly this preference was but in earlier versions of you should be able to follow to enable the once you have done you should be able to right click if you have a right mouse and choose to bring up the web in more recent versions of you should also be able to choose web from the develop this will show you a lot of information on your css and how the metrics on the elements which should help you debug the

 seem like the approach your looking but what i i 2 i think if you have an odd number of characters the substring will probably probably have to add a check and use something like 2 0 2 but i to me the difficulty here is that your reduce actually depends on the array index rather than the hence my solution of enumerating the array indexes and working from another solution would be to provide a method think of one built that enumerates the characters in the string using a tuple that contains the index and the

 seems to be a reasonable the reason you want to use too many static is that you end up moving away from object oriented programming and more into the realm of structured your case where you are simply transforming a to say all doing is transforming text to go from a static method would make if invoking these static methods on an object frequently and it tends to be unique for many calls the way you use it depends on the or it is part of the inherent behavior of the it would be wise to make it part of the object and maintaining a state of one way to do this would be to implement it as an method return transformed string method return transformed string object implements interface mystring implementations of the interface would yield the necessary and it is reusable across the board since it an interface you can make it specific to the method method one good example of great use of static methods are html helper methods in mvc or they create html elements that tied to the behavior of an and are therefore changed functional programming to structured programming some reason i got props to torsten for pointing that

 short answer start by becoming an active user of the it will make it long answer problem that open source projects want help most would be happy to have all of the help they can the problem is that most people who decide to help stick around just long enough to take some time away from the development then and never show up have been very active in a couple of open source projects in the and we ran into this all of the it was very easy to get people to want to but very hard to get them to actually put the effort required into the project in order to be i personally spent many hours trying to help out new prospective and nearly always ended up just watching them team will be much more responsive if you can prove that serious and it usually takes more than just showing up in a chat or on a mailing start by finding the right easy to find open source but more difficult to find the one the right fit for is the or the easy depending on your point of recommend starting with a project that you are familiar with and hopefully one if you find one interested try using the software in its current state before you even think about trying to join the development if you are a user of the more likely that be interested in contributing over the project will do two things it will familiarize you with how they are thinking about the this will often make it easier to understand the design of the but most help you understand the goals of the current also often easier to get the ear of a if you have specific questions to i personally am always very responsive to a intelligent this helps build a relationship with the current development become familiar with the team and the project and have some idea of try to fix one or two of the this is an easy way to show that you can be productive and and will be received fairly that the team will probably be much more receptive to helping you find longer term goals and tasks on which to had a couple of people who approached our projects more along these and all been very happy to help them try to figure out how to fit in and mesh with the team as the goal you want to just be a contributor in the long want to be part of the when you start feeling ownership over the and when it really gets

 since ive been actually solved this created two web one for process navigation and one for filtering documents in the document web part for process navigation is actually just a web part that looks for a specific query parameter in the url and adds to then looks for that document in a document if found then this document is shown inside an html documents are produced by visio and exported to then uploaded to the links in the visio document drives the application with web part that shows the corresponding documents also looks for a specific query in the url then sends filterparameters to the document library through the ifilterprovider i snatched this example at and made it look in the url for parameters and then made the coltrols invisible to the simple though the customer needs to put in a lot of work to incorporate their company processes into and it is somewhat error prone and probably a sucker to make changes to	
 single eclipse workbench can create multiple each window is laid out using a so different windows could be set to different or the same and you can switch perspectives in each window independently of the other can also set input for each this is useful if each window is working on different data each window could be connected to a different server or could be showing data from different databases that all have the same schema but different may be that you are using windows only so that you can see different perspectives of the same data on different in that case you do not need to programatically create the windows but need only add the action supplied by the this can be done by modifying your actionbaradvisor to the field iworkbenchaction to the code where you make the actions a method called newwindowaction to the code where you create the menu is typically the window if you have a window menu already in your application and would like to create the following line will menumanager menu new will give you a menu item that will create a new window in the same way as the window menu item in the eclipse on the other you want each window to show different data then you will need to open the new windows this allows you to set different input for each you will need a line of code something newpage inputobject contains information that identifies the data shown in the if you want to set the initial perspective this can be done by calling setperspective on the will want to set the title in each windowtitle is a string describing the input to the can fetch the input for a window as can then cast this to whatever class you are using as your window

 so first the answer to your assuming you have some structure like public class public string the original type type currtype node thisnode string while methodinfo mi if propertyvalue new propertykey if return currtype to its base currtype return public class othernode new public string return says public class testnode implementation of getintrinsicproperty above will do what but i would suggest that forcing a child class to exactly replicate your signature and a developer to understand what you this is what virtual methods are if understanding you correctly the proper way to do what you want is public class public virtual string case return call on return public class othernode public override string switch case return the and i know call on return public class testnode static void node node new var prop1 var prop2 var prop3 node new prop1 prop2 prop3 idea of virtual methods is that the type of your variable determine which implementation is but rather the run time type of the object determines far as i can the situation describing is one where you are trying do your own dispatch to the implementation of a method on the runtime type of the pretty much the definition of a virtual i get the question please	
 so for a programming assignment that i have we are all allowed to turn to any source we find suitable for i have to find out how much time processes spend first attempt was creating a bash that looked something like i in egrep cat grep then all of the problems are reporting the sleeping plus this method would require me to poll like so running the test will probably change the compiling a new version of a linux with syscalls or a way to keep tracking of processes states out of the my only worry is trying to find out how to keep track of changing process states and making sure that i miss the amount of time processes spend	
 so i have to build a web app in id much much much prefer because its more modern and makes more sense to i know mvc and have come from a rails so this webforms stuff looks kinda gross to me i need an tree one that loads the subtrees via ajax when nodes are asp mvc i would do something like making a partial representing a single and a jquery ajax triggered controller action that renders a collection of these which is inserted into the children in my options a webforms control that represents a single use asp ajax to call a codebehind method that recursivley adds controls representing the children of this fits well within the offical asp pretty webforms are and makes upgrading this site to later much a webservices method that returns the children as a json which are then formatted to html in using jquery for the requesting and speedy due to low overheads with more as easily transition to mvc controller more work to html ends up mixed up in with the clientside theres no templating which is a third party web least best have to evalutate which one to may have to with control other what do you guys think is the best way to ajax	
 so if i understand all of the hardware is done your system has a command input that is a current level in amperes by say a double precision floating point number in and the output of the controller is a voltage that controls hardware that draws your plant is the circuit and the feedback is probably an 10 or 16 bit number either signed or unsigned depending on your your system looks like quickest and dirtiest approach is probably pid you can brush up on the basics with wikipedia and there are some hints on implementation in this a nutshell you want to compute the error of the system which in your example is the current command current make sure everything is in the same hopefully after your error is calculated you have to correct it with a in your system that is the voltage command to your current with the command is calculated by multiplying the the integral of the and the derivative of the error by gains and summing the the gains are the tricky the other tricky parts making sure your units are making sure the timing is and the correct your system you have many error is the command is which turns into then the current use is amps which is reported as volts which gets turned into either a signed or unsigned integer which has to be scaled back into amperes to make the error have lots of make sure you can keep track of what physical unit applies to control algorithm is hard and has to run at a dedicated i would recommend at least 100hz every electronic circuits move quickly not like electromechanical you may need a higher rate to stay on top of but it has to be hard real time that means you may not even be able to get away with software and derivative calculations are tricky but there are only so many ways to do the most basic algorithm is the rectangle rule dumb but it will probably if you need to be more precise use trapezoidal check the algorithms out most likely you use derivative control it tends to make things unstable and needed in most you ought to be fine with are lots of pitfalls but this should get you if had a background in control theory then it should all come back to once the framework is in place spend a lot of time tuning the proportional and integral gains the meat of the if this still seems like too much math for sorry this is about as simple as it gets for	
 so the essential problem is that you need to do not integer as others have pointed i think fixing this particular code is sort of besides the why bother with it in the first using essentially the same class of algorithm is you want a fast consider an if you want a you have out of the box much consider the numerical recipes algorithm fairly combined which you could implement in java as class highqualityrandom extends random private lock l new private long private long v private long w public public u seed v w public long try u u 2862933555777941757l v v v v v v w 4294957665l long x u x x x x return finally protected int return is copied from some code where i needed it to be you could get rid of the lock in or just use regular you absolutely insist on using at least wrap it in a random and let take care of converting ints to doubles after what extensible libraries in an language are

 so you really should seek qualified legal however is certainly going against the spirit of the license win you any friends in kernel you could consider a different one approach is to fully module and put all your company in a this is an approach i took when the company i worked keen on exposing the details of our fpga to the all and register settings where decided in user space and side of the driver just loaded values in on with you can manage any real time issues you may have and have clean separation between your closed driver and the this is easier with newer kernels with support for user although i think they support dma properly yet had a user space dma kernel module to support dma directly chipset and user i would really recommend you consider what it is to closed drivers may be ok for embedded you have tight control over the kernel version and the if this driver is being considered for anything more generic hardware people will plug into their own then drivers will only prove to be a source of constant pain

 solution is generally but has a few update you have to shut down and have some otehr app update you to prevent the this is usually handled by having a dedicated app that you it might be the target of the app icon and therefore does updates with every or it may be launched via a for type of menu you have to launch it and make sure the actual app generally a good idea to provide some form of in the event of a interrupted updates are going to require wholesale updates of this may not be what you want in the end may want to update just a single assembly or so starting with the logic of pulling down individual files is going to make you way more but still very resource is alex article on creating

 solution makes your system dependent on javascript to a more robust solution is to build something that is at least without and then on load use javascript to modify the behavior of the buttons to do something more requires more code to do it that way and as but if looking for the you may want to weigh in and determine whether handling the is a priority or ever route you you should at least consciously make a decision one way or another instead of letting it surprise you later	
 solution requiring no javascript or even you are being automatically redirected to a new if your browser does not redirect you in 10 or you not wish to advantage of this solution over using the header is that you need to pause the script which will appear to the user as if the server is busy or their connection has solution also gives the user the option of proceeding to the new page immediately rather than having to wait number of while their browser displays no i think also worth noting that if you do decide to use the the you need to make sure your duration too i think most browsers generate a timed after not receiving any data from the server for 1

 solution with examples in python as a good substitute for pseudo a grid 20 x that the tetrominoes fall are made up of which have attributes of coordinate and for the tetrominoe looks like 4 5 6 7 8 19 20 the is a collection of blocks with the coords the shape is a matter of applying a simple transformation to all the coords in the to move the shape down add left or right to all coords in the collection that make the also lets you use some simple trig to rotate the shape by the rule is that when rotating relative to an then becomes equal to is an example to explain taking the from use the as the centre block to rotate for make this the first coordinate in the here is a simple function to rotate that collection of coordinates by shape for selecting the x and y get the middle middle work out the coordinates of the other blocks relative to middle rel for coords in now rotate for coords in return if you apply this function to our collection of coordinate for the this out in the coordinate system and it looks like 4 5 6 7 8 18 19 20 was the hardest bit for hope this helps	
 solution you are proposing has too much i would suggest you store the data in at least buckets instead of hourly and the time zone be normalized to if a user requests hourly data for 1 2pm from utc you can fetch data for from your system and show if you store data in increments you service requests to users in time zones with n hour daily numbers you would need to aggregate 48 the slots to pick would be determined by the time gets interesting when you get to annual data because you end up having to aggregate to ease that computation i would suggest you get the annual data per utc time and the subtract aggregate data for the first for hours of the year and add aggregate data for the first hours of the next this will essentially shift the whole year by hours and the work is not that working from you can tweak the system turns out kathmandu is gmt so you would need to store the data in buckets instead of another easy improvement is around aggregating annual so you have to add buckets each time and without requiring one aggregate per aggregate the annual data from jan 02 dec since the maximum difference between any two countries is 23 this means that you can take the annual data 02 dec and add a few buckets before and after as for example for a utc timezone you would add all buckets on jan 01 after all buckets on dec and on jan 01 the following year up to 0500	
 solution you go with also is dependent on how compliant you choose are to be with the java ee jpa is for data access in java ee so if particular about adhering to you should use it some is a standardization of mapping as it does not provide an it simply defines a standardized hibernate entity manager is one such jpa is a standard across multiple vendors and since it is still fairly it lacks some more esoteric functionality that is valuable in some use cases a criteria api for generating dynamic if you go with jpa plan on situations where nee to use hibernate or even jdbc for situations such as a generic dao pattern is very you can modify this data access for use in jpa jdbc quite has some difficult restrictions if used to and imposes certain approaches on you that are difficult for developers who are more used to writing straight if you are championing this as an be sure to do your homework about the pros cons of orm you go with once reached the learning curve it will pay off in terms of simple development if you properly implement the abovementioned dao but also in getting caching of query if done properly big i i have seen this provide handsome if you have a legacy data model that you have little flexibility hibernate will give you more headaches than maybe for the database does not have candidate primary keys effective hashcode equals you will need to do upfront analysis on which columns define a row uniquely maybe maybe complex depending on the complexity of your unable to add version or timestamp you lose ability to do optimistic and end up having to query before in response to first if lucky enough to your two very considerations if going to using an a version number column to all relevant tables to support optimistic your data decide on that developers should use for use pk columns in those	
 solve i ended up using the tupletopropertyresulttransformer and providing the list of property there are a few limitations to the main one being that the sql query must return the results in the same order as you provide your properties to the tupletopropertyresulttransformer the property types are inferred so you need to be careful with decimal columns returning only integer values apart from that using the tupletopropertyresulttransformer provided a reasonably easy way to use an sql query to return a collection of objects without explicitly mapping the objects within

 somewhat common knowledge that python functions can have a maximum of 256 what curious to know is if this limit applies to and when unrolled in the following ask there might be cases where a list larger than 256 items gets unrolled as a set of or is a maximum number of arguments in a python	
 somewhat depends how you created the menu since a menuitem is a container that can contain if you created it is the you can access the label widget in the menu item can then treat that as a normal is the new unless you made the menu item you guarantee that the child widget will be a label like so you should take some

 sort order matters when you want to retrieve lots of sorted not individual that you are suggesting with your the sort order is typically far less significant than what columns you are indexing system can read the index in reverse if the order is opposite what it i rarely give index sort order any whereas i agonize over the columns covered by the provides a of when it

 sounds like all talking of and projects where the client pays you however much time you take to complete the on a project like that i can see how this comes into play and i would recommend being of the projects i work on are the customer gives us an idea of what they we then work up a if the customer like the numbers they go if ok with the numbers then they agree to the whether we have to learn something to get the job done or not the price remains the in this situation it the customer either agrees to the price or not and it matter how much time it takes

 sounds like the limitations are a moot point if your live db is which support if you have more than 8k characters to store you are pretty much left with the only other a text beware that text columns have a lot of limitations example you sort or group on them nor can you compare them for equivalency with other that is you say select from mytable where relevant suggest using an ntext nvarchar field regardless of the you go to support if the table has a lot of columns and the is likely to be frequently close you may have problems with row limit of keep this in	
 sounds like the pem file is a client cert for you to use to login to the if it is the client and it sounds like it you will likely need a ca cert file also to use in validating the servers certificate in order to establish a ca certs need to go into a truststore and your client certs need to go into a in both of these will be jks it has limited support for there are default locations for the jre as well as for each you can also specify external locations for these files in your as in the examples the library seems to be able to support pem without the need for but i used default passphrase for these keystores in java is without the shows you have to read the pem into your here is you have your truststore and keystore set up you need to pass the following system to your may specify them as parameters to the jre as in the examples you finish heres a of creating a heres the java api for heres also an that use any apache

 sounds like what asking about involves serializing the data structure of a django model instance for the other posters are if you wanted the serialized form to be used with a python application that can query the database via then you would wan to serialize a queryset with one on the other what you need is a way to the model instance somewhere else without touching the database or without using then you have a little bit of work to what i i use for the it happened to be what i found but it might not be the my implementation depends on one of its but there should be similar ways with other implement a method on all models that you might need this is a magic method for but probably something going to want to think about no matter what implementation you the idea is that you return an object that is directly convertible to an array or if you really want to do this dictionary for field in return will not be helpful to you unless you have a completely flat data structure only numbers and strings in the you should seriously think about the right way to implement this call and you have what you

 spent most of last week at a university library studying debugging of concurrent the central problem is concurrent code is academic debugging has fallen into one of three camps this requires an event monitor and then reviewing the events that were in a ut this would involve manually sending the events as part of a and then doing this is where you interact with the running code with a set of x this could be interpreted into a ut framework where you have a system triggering a given test on a certain this obviously work in an automatic testing as above commentators have you can design your concurrent system into a more deterministic if you do that just back to designing a sequential system suggestion would be to focus on having a very strict design protocol about what gets threaded and what get if you constrain your interface so that there is minimal dependancies between it is much and keep working on the

 stack alignment is when variables are placed on the stack to a particular number of so if you are using a 16 bit stack each variable on the stack is going to start from a byte that is a multiple of 2 bytes from the current stack pointer within a means that if you use a variable that is 2 such as a char there will be 8 bits of unused between it and the next this allows certain optimisations with assumptions based on variable calling one method of passing arguments to the next function is to place them on the stack opposed to placing them directly into whether or not alignment is being used here is as the calling function places the variables on the to be read off by the calling function using if the calling function aligns the and the called function expects them to be then the called function be able to find seems that the msvc compiled code is disagreeing about variable try compiling with all optimisations turned

 standard has designed iterators to feel and behave as much like pointers as since iterators are based on the only relevant thing is that the iterator type has the proper operators the result is that pointers will behave just like random access a possible implementation of is to just make it a for an array you have the useful and methods to find the valid iterator but the problem you always have with c style as has been mentioned in the comments and other you can implement those functions for arrays if the array is not dynamic and has not decayed into a but my basic point was that you have to be more careful than when using the standard

 strongly disagree with the answer provided by the whole point of scrum is to get rid of the method where designers first their and then go on to other completely and against all lean scrum way to incorporate designers in a scrum throw into the make sure not just wrapping a waterfall project into scrum as the best way towards scrum only works when implemented without is the worst project organize work so that possible for concurrent designing and overdo initial but make it a where both sides of the coin influence the the point of scrum is to iterate and so take full benefit from pretty lean to actually shun traditional design you can read more about this from this excellent blog post in signal

 suggest you zoom out and evaluate how the form process and user experience works before refactoring your is it necessary to give feedback to the user immediately when inputting can it wait until completed filling out the if you can just use a regular form validate the submission and return and the experience requires immediate you may want to look into creating a generic wrapper around your implementation to handle form this can be done or you can look around on google for form validation mechanisms that allow you define specific urls and per your third option could be to do the validation without contacting the determine whether your logic can be done in javascript if it involves date this be too and try to add a layer that does that for you so you need to contact the server in the first depending on how fast your server side code this could actually improve the user experience remember that validation is still a the example use case you gave in your it sounds like my former suggestion applies namely that not entirely necessary to be so immediate in your feedback on whether the form is being filled out if my understanding of your situation is i would advise starting the refactoring process by removing the ajax calls and having it work as a normal and then adding in validation once that	
 suggested by nunfur i changed my approach and rather than throwing an i return a are at least two the first one would be to encapsulate my business object into a response object with some status i tried this but it makes the json more rather than adding a new object i added two properties to my business something like servicestatus and by default these are 200 and but can be set by the webmethod code if anything goes wrong proper in this case they business object will be the javascript code then first checks for the servicestatus and reacts add the two fields to all my objects that are returned by even a simple they have to implement an interface with those two i have complete control over that goes over the wire in case something unexpected is for the	
 suggestion covers and i think is if any of the 4 vertices of are inside then check if any of the 4 vertices of are inside how suggest to go about the vertex of checking is and the 4 vertices of are v1 all 5 vertices by a vector u by an orientation matrix multiply u by u assuming that in your convention orientation works by resulting 2nd call it is now axis aligned you can immediately check whether is contained in you found any inside of you have otherwise few optimizations immediately pop to mind you can store unrotated copies of the vertices in each if the sizes are maybe you can compare them to immediately eliminate one of the possible and save 3 potential but unless applying it on gazillions of box this test should be cheap enough as the you can get as deep as you want there look up and see for specifically remember some nice works by stephane i whole heartedly believe that no game does any of this fancy if you are indeed moving extremely you can subdivide your time step and perform collision checks on each there was another discussion about with nice

 suspect the difference is a conversion from an floating point value to a long vs a conversion from an floating point value to a one and a conversion to a reason for 80 bits coming up at all is that a typical precision used for actual and the width of floating point the result is something like the conversion from that to a long yields the nearest floating point value to the value is actually so the conversion ends up yielding to give this a bit more a java program which uses arithmetic to do the same note that it converts the double value closest to into a bigdecimal that value is other the exact result of the calculation is 11 class public static void bigdecimal c new bigdecimal a new bigdecimal b new bigdecimal result the other correct to about 40 decimal digits more than either 64 or 80 bit floating point can consider what this number looks like in i have any tools to easily do the but again we can use java to assuming a normalised the part ends up using three bits less than for eleven that leaves 60 bits of mantissa for extended precision and 48 bits for double precision the closest number to 11 in each use class public static void bigdecimal half new bigdecimal eleven new the three numbers got work out the closest value to the correct one for each precision for extended less than round each of those values to a and you end up with 10 and 11 this is enough evidence to convince the doubters

 synchronize overflowed using code like	
 synchronized functions for the same marking a method is very similar to putting a block around the entire contents of the the reason i say is because i know offhand whether the compiler emits the same bytecode or but afaik the defined runtime effect is the deadlock is a classic locking one thread locks then simultaneously on a the other thread locks this part requires that the scheduling of the threads just so happens to interleave at the right thread whatever order or then attempts to acquire a lock which is already held by the other and hence each thread goes to neither will wake until the other releases its but neither will release its lock until it wakes is

 talk to a very wide variety of the potential clients and find out their what they are currently using and what they wish their current could spend 10 times as long at this as you think you need to right draw out a potential guis on paper and have the people you interview look at the drawings and make if at all hire some people in the industry as business analysts to help with this ask about legal some industries have a lot of legal complicance issues and others do anything related in any way to the medical world and you will need to research and fully understand hippa for the database structure and a gui then get some real users to play with refactor based on what they say amazing how many things users leave out in requirements gathering that they think of until faced with an actual about what needs to common through all the potential customers and where you might need customization your interviews should guide you decide how to handle or even if you will allow this may depend a great deal on the industry and how standard their practices this is box often the design includes a table with customizable fields that can be added to forms and reports by the a often each user wanting customization may have their own database where the custom information is stored a central standrad database for the noncustomizable and the programmers make the changes based on requests from the if you take this the second time you do a simliar customization for a second consider if you need to refactor to make this a new feature of the software available to no need to write 17 custom attendance reports that vary only by one or two fields when the client can for less money have a standard the web you can also create a bunch of modules and have the clients pick and choose which to add to their custom they would pay based on the number and complexity of the modules they so the client that wants only three of the standard reports would pay less than the client that wants all when a new customization is the client pays for development if the suggestion seem to immdeiately apply to but the module is done so that others can buy it as if others buy the orginal client who asked for the change might get part of the money until their development costs is they could also require that something remain as a custom module and pay a much higher price for this we have some clients who even want their data on the same servers in the same location as other needless to we charge a huge premium for doing something like is expensive and can lead to many more programmers consider very strongly before you go the customization it can really be the thing which sells your software but it scale it bad when you have ten cutomers but when you have a couple of hundred it can get out of control very it is a lot harder to back off of customization once you offer than to add customization later from a standard often the need for customization is more in the organization of corporate if you can create a reporting interface where people can pick and choose what information they want and save their own custom you might handle most of the customization needs in your industry without customization

 tempting to think about solving this kind of problem using the techniques of another in practice rarely a there are probably some canned solutions that get it right most of the time tell you in their documentation when they get it using that might miss the point of the so think twice about for a very few number of it might be feasable to roll your but for a project of any reasonable its not likely to be worth the debugging when programming in language you should use the idioms of language write java when using write c when using write when using probably end up using something like but actually use a union of and and to make the common cases convenient an enumed type also probably end up implementing a fibonacci just cause that sounds and you can only implement rb trees so many times before it loses even if that is better for the common cases be used based on your it looks like got a pretty good case for using a canned if your instructor allows and the syntax it offers feels give it a

 that has helped me in the along with creation on demand as mghie was to use the call lockwindowupdate around the frame this call is global in nature but will reduce the initial flicker as the paint operations will not get invoked until after you relase the lock on the parent the general code template would look something like the your frame code goes running with the window it will not respond to paint also the function is so anything else that calls will break your when the lock is then the window is immediately which saves you from performing that call in as pointed out in the comments care should be taken when using the lockwindowupdate however i have used this method with great success in the past and still recommend if used what you want to do with this method is to call inside this or pop up a modal dialog or a showmessage call even populate from a just restrict the portion within the lock to what your if you play your users notice anything also used as a but in reality i generally only lock handle of the container that the frame is being placed could try the method mentioned in the article in the but this requires that the message loop is also processed and generally my calls to lockwindowupdate are extremely

 the best advice as every other poster on this topic has to write often been in the situation where this is if the code is that line embedded and undocumented magic code also likely to have another which is that deeply coupled and components are almost impossible to isolate a codebase that loads and hundreds of different database objects on components assume random parts of the cache and parts of the cache assume other parts of the cache you have to load the whole thing to get code dependant on and promiscuously state where impossible to determine setting those or even what they suggestions i can come up to fix the things hardcoded magic number obvious code perhaps a quick release that gets rid of the worst of the violations will be of low risk and make the next steps easier to organizational support for refarctoring often no will or desire to do work that add immediate and risks breaking existing there of great arguments for but not everybody buys if the organization support it you may have to give it other developers around to the same view if any probably as unhappy with the codebase as you if new code is built to better standards and people are start to fix older code as tweaks need to be a particular subsystem is really bad and has reached the point where new development is nearly impossible you can probably use this opportunity to rebuild	
 the best approach for injecting dependencies if spring or guice are not your library was written in a it should be fairly easy to use as a straitforward java think of your past experience with there are several libraries out there that fit perfectly with the spring model but were written before spring i see nothing bad with a followed by a couple of followed by a call to the just be extra among other your client can forget to call thouse methods that spring reliably i consider something like a factory method to instantiate and wire the the dependencies are all inside the so it seem appropriate to have the application instantiate each dependency to create the main the client application decide you are providing a let the api client wire its own provide an that same example can be used to make the factory method on the maybe the client application has own way to configure and it would be desirable if the api your library provides to be flexible enough to take advantage of maybe you can include the licence is just like a whole piece of java

 the course of my maintenance for an older application that badly violated the update rules in i created the following extension method as a way to quickly fix illegal calls when discovered execute a method on the owning control that is being method that updates to force synchronous execution of false to allow asynchronous execution if the call is from a if the method is called on the gui execution is always static void control action bool if throw new if if if do nothing if the handle created the for ensuring that the handle they give us if throw new is already like how i can leverage closures to though forcesynchronous needs to be true in that taskname taskname question the usefulness of this method for fixing up illegal calls in legacy but what about new it good design to use this method to update ui in a piece of new software when you may not know what thread is attempting to update the or should new winforms code generally contain a dedicated method with the appropriate plumbing for all such ui try to use the other appropriate background processing techniques of this work for i just recently discovered that they derive directly from instead of from the containing invoke should be to comments suggest the following means that invokerequired if invoke is not call occurs on the same or the control was created on different thread but the handle has not yet been the case where the has not yet been you not simply call or events on the this cause the handle to created on the background isolating the control on a without a message pump and making application can protect against this case also checking the value ishandlecreated when returns false on a background the control was created on a different thread but the handle has not yet been returns this means that if returns will always be testing it again is redundant and it appropriate to extend control to provide consistently safe

 the fact that it seems to be a bug in one of the erlang libs i think you could easily circumvent the the fact your file is i think best practice is that you process it as the following it works nicely on an unpatched erlang and because it uses lazy evaluation it can handle files of arbitrary length without having to read all of it into memory the module contains an example of a function to apply to each line turning a line of of integers into a list of applies a function to all lines of the before reducing reads the lines of a file in a lazy this one does the lazy read case eof l take a line of space separated integers and them into a list of with as a you can easily fold over the lines of any file running out of memory 73 52 40 26 53 06 10 51 87 86 61 95 66 57 25 90 81 80 38 92 67 30 28 51 76 81 18 75

 the final changed the format string in a benchmark trial to something that should favor my code a little quick brown jumped over the lazy i this fares much better compared to the 2 million iterations in seconds for this code vs seconds for this is an undeniable you might even be tempted to start using this as a replacement for many after do no worse and you might even get a small performance as much and nothing to sneeze that it keep in still talking less than half a second difference for 2 under a situation specifically designed to favor this not even busy pages are likely to create that much unless lucky enough to work on a top100 web of this omits one important you can just create a new each time and manually handle your own formatting using raw with that technique my benchmark finished in a much greater in the if in a situation where the performance matters there is a better alternative and if it you probably want to stick with the clarity of using the simple

 the perspective of a cross java accessibility how would you link to a package but only optionally execute an action based on of a package already at think what interested in here is a way to resolve the identity but rather than the issue being beetween 2 apps sharing being a service loaded at a higher level of the class seems like reflection is the way to but i am not sure how or if i can implement a derived class this i need to add a specific listener derived from the specific optional i can load the listener using the applet class loader but the internals still say you wanted to add an but swing guaranteed to be using reflection you can find the method to add the but how can you create and have the frame listener work if it cannot find any of the related classes because they be found in the base do i need to create a thread and use setcontextclassloader to the classloader that knows about swing so that i can get the class to be loaded simply trying to set the class loader on my existing thread seem to description of not quite sure what to ask or how to make this so it rambles on a a class uses some feature of but the other class may not always be available say finding the website from jnlp if this is a jnlp one stage i thought that simply compiling against jnlp would mean that my class would not load unless jnlp was and so to identify this optional section i simply wrapped a noclassdeffounderror around something changed changing jdk or i and it seemed that i should also use a classnotfoundexception i wanted to extend this idea to other optional but it seem to work i wanted to add some feature to do something more advanced in a runtime using the same jar and classes as i run in a or say i want to handle some controls in a specific gui toolkit which may not always be used like swt or there some way of doing this more it just seems wrong to cause an exception and catch it to ignore it all the current issue comes down to being able to compile against but then the accessibility component installed in ext is unable to access the classes even though objects from the package have been if i throw the into the ext directory to test then the accessibility component works up to the point that the whole lot gets flakey because of the different versions of the same seem to be caught up on an issue with the class loader not being the right one or something how do i find the right answers so far are kindof interesting but not quite getting me where i want to the case of the gui components i currently compile in the form of a factory something public icomponentnode inode component component component instanceof formdesktopcontainer does stuff here like return new component catch noclassdeffounderror a it prints out and then throws and exception on the instanceof call with noclassdeffound thus printing out how can it have an instance of a class yet not be able to find to link to a package but only optionaly execute an action based on of package at

 the thing you are having trouble with is defining the proper the interface defines the interaction between the subscriber and the make a winforms like static class the main entry point for the static void interface void class observerlist public void foreach titem in are making two things the first the interface which the subscribers will then a list for the publisher to hold all the make form one with two one labeled form 2 and the other labeled form then add a then another button labeled public partial class form1 private new private observerlist myobservers new public private void eventargs form2 frmnewform new private void eventargs form3 frmnewform new private void eventargs private void eventargs deliberately set up the form2 button and the form3 button to make multiple copies of each type of for you can have twelve up at will notice that after creating each form i put it into the observers i am able to do this because both form2 and form3 implement after i show the form i call refresh on the observer list so the new form is updated with the latest note i could have cast it to a variable of iobserver and updated just that i am trying to be as brief as for the add button i pull the text from the textbox store it in my datalist and then refresh all the make add a list box and the following public partial class form2 public private void eventargs void foreach s in add a combobox and add the following public partial class form3 public private void eventargs void foreach s in will notice that each form implements the refresh method of the iobserver interface slightly one is for a listbox the other for a combo the use of interfaces is the key element a real world application this example would be more for example instead of passing the string list in the refresh it would not have any instead the publisher in this would implement a publisher interface and register itself with the observers as they are being each observer would be able to accept a publisher in initialization then when it is refreshed it would pull the string list out of the publisher via a method exposed through the more complex applications with multiple types of data this allows you customize what data the form implementing iobserver is pulling out of the course if you only want the observer to be able to display a string list or specific then pass it as part of the the interface makes explicit what want each layer to this way 5 years from now you can look at the code and code that what it is

 the validation can be done at many different levels and usually none of them is of the model can be populated with invalid data that do not come from the but we can also create forms whose data do not go to any the direct validation in models is unsually not integrated with our form rendering which causes problems if we want to show the error messages and the form with the data of the solutions have their own pros and it would be perfect to have a system that ensures us that the validation finally must be done at some if the form does not validate some then the model does and vice i heard of such but i must note that the validators in the frameworks unsually are you can pass the post data to but the same can be done with the information retreived from a properly parsed mysql

 there are architectural strengths and there was a while in there when powerpc chips consistently beat their intel counterparts in a range of floating point intensive and that difference was reflected in how fast they ran some of the nuclear physics codes i was working on at the they ran word and excel like and then their clock speeds really started to and it was all over for powerpc chips on the i image apple only stuck with them for as long as they did so that they could get the execution layer working note that many architectures have simd instruction multiple floating point and integer arithmetic units these days those these are only mildly vectorized in the general purpose chips when compared to special purpose processors like

 thing that uuids buy you that is very difficult to do otherwise is to get a unique identifier having to consult or coordinate with a central the general problem of being able to get such a thing without some sort of managed infrastructure is the problem the uuids read that according to the birthday paradox the chance of a uuid collision occuring is once uuids have been now is a pretty big but a chance of collision seems far too risky how many uuids need to exist before a chance of collision even that seems like too large of a problem with that analysis is are not entirely random there are major components of the uuid that are time so to have any real chance at a the colliding uuids need tobe generated at the exact same time from different uuid say that while there is a reasonable chance that several might be generated at the same enough other gunk location info or random to make the likeyhood of a collision between this very small set of uuids nearly uuids only need to be unique among the set of other uuids that they might be compared if generating a uuid to use as a database it matter if somewhere else in an evil alternate universe that the same uuid is being used to identify a com just like cause no confusion if someone else named on

 think a controller should be dealing with model tend to think that controller is really part of the ui i prefer to inject a service layer the controller and the rest of the the web tier accepts http unmarshals parameters from request objects into objects that the service interface can deal and marshals the response to send all the work with units of and dealing with model and persistence objects is done by the approach is more service it separates the service from the user leaving open the possibility that several clients can reuse the same it makes the layer that marshals requests to the service so easy to switch out soap services for rest or ejb or corba or whatever the next new thing will

 think about presumably you want to store of expression in a storing the whole you distinguish between an identical tree and a hash hashes map a larger set onto a smaller set is why a hash is so by have least the possibility you get an expression hash it and then go look up a result in your which leads to two a hash not in the one that you seen you have to let this one as you have a cached a hash in the but since you store the old expression tree that produced the hash in your no way to compare the newly passed expression to the old you may have a match or you may have a no way to distinguish between those two you return the cached because it might be a even if not a even if it is the exact same expression tree as the one you last how do we know that the backing object a a had elements added or deleted or modified such that the result returned by the expression might be different than the cached you can hash a tree leaf return return is some operation or more generally this is the same recursion we use to evaluate an expression we call

 think that its really part of fusebox job to define access to code setting xfas each time is not really flexible style am typically use security tokens to restrict each fuseaction name is token by other custom tokens can be added by in your case custom tokens whould be and am using groups based so fuseaction permissions look like this is default security mapping for the fuseaction say i keep access map in so fuseaction and custom tokens being pushed into map when used first time and can be changed check access used simple method which compares current user groups your case with token way is a bit more flexible and gives you ability to define default access levels for different token to switch between strict if and loose if modes this

 think that possible to control the autogenerated at least with the current creating a new control that inherits from the you might have a bit more control of the way the columns are but not shure if it is doable still be worth to the msdn the autogeneratecolumns is set to an object is automatically created each field in the data field is then displayed as a column the gridview control in the order the fields appear in the data this option provides a convenient to display every field in the you have control of how an generated column field is displayed generated bound fields are not added to the of letting gridview control generate the column you manually define the column fields setting the property to false and then creating custom columns in to bound column you can display a button column a box column a command hyperlink column an or a column field based on own for see	
 think that the main difference is that marshalling supposedly also involves the in other you would not be able to marshal and unmarshal an object into a instance of a different just means that you can store the object and reobtain an equivalent even if it is an instance of another being they are typically	
 think that the main reasons that is not a keyword no compelling reason for it to the designers of the c and languages have always preferred to have language features be implemented in the library if possible and keywords to a language can create problems for an existing body of legacy this is another reason they are generally resistant to adding new in discussing the next major revision of the had this to improvements should be done in such a way that the resulting language is easier to learn and among the rules of thumb for the committee standard library facilities to language extensions	
 think that the programmer has to just start doing a few simple tests to start with are easy to justify as part of like a unit test is almost always necessary to get fast debugging turn just explain how much faster it is to launch the test than it is to arrange the correct set a debugger launch the the test in your just put a comment explaining where the test is and how to run future programmers will see it and hopefully the testing will

 think that this is what you are looking sql from where not strcon conn new comm new nwreader int userid do something with userid do have to that the overall approach can use a lot of you could at least start by simplifying access to your for you could add the following to your using using public partial class global public static string void eventargs connectionstring throughout your just access it conn new create a class in which the is to run the same query in my just using qry new sqldatareader nwreader if i needed to add a parameter add it above as while int userid do something with userid is just an example using notice that there is no connection no command or connection objects being created or just a does lots of different things in addition to that your approach would differ depending on the tasks that you do most

 think the buzzwordiness of calling it is actually detracting from its usefulness and the wider adoption of the i read up on i think the claim that it was oo actually slowed my understanding of what it really who know what means in programming will be because not is just an attempt to apply some oo principles to css to improve its and on the other most developers will not understand the concept at all if not and so just be baffled or great needs maximum power css css css something like	
 think the c method is the way to 0 means anything else means if you go with another mapping for then you are left with the problem of having indeterminate values that are neither true nor this is language that be compiling for a specific instruction set that has special support for a particular then let that guide but absent any additional for an internal go with in this value extends well to whatever size boolean you want and if you break up a or a into a smaller or its still the if you broke a 16 bit get a and a	
 think the command is the one looking it starts a process separately to the console and part of so no extra software i was of the opinion that gui apps did this maybe delphi is different to up a console and type states in the gui application do generally detach the actual shell doing trickery in that it waits for it to finish if running from a cmd from the prompt will start it in the background but within a cmd file will within the cmd you need to whatever your application is called

 think the important thing to remember here is that each table in your might have multiple these are the wikipedia entry for candidate all candidate keys are created they are each unique identifiers for the table in job then is to select the best candidate from the pool of candidate keys to serve as the the primary key will be used by other tables to establish the relational but you are free to continue using candidate keys to query the primary keys are referenced by other and therefore used in join the criteria for primary key selection boils down to the following for me order of primary key values should not if they you run the risk of introducing update most dbms platforms require that the primary key are not simple datatypes and values for physical storage and integer values work well and this is the datatype of choice for most identified the candidate the criteria above can be used to select the primary if there is not a candidate key meets the then a surrogate key that does meet the criteria can be created and used as mentioned in other	
 think the key thing is set up as an application in subdirectory of another a separate application within iis it should have own file and the security settings can be set from so have one for the main site and one for the really they are two just a subfolder under your website then this it depends how set it up under if a seperate app then the icon will be a type if a they the icon will be well a	
 think the number 1 reason from a management standpoint is for perceived if you work on more than one project at the same time stakeholders are able to see progress if you hold one project off then the stakeholders of that project may not like that nothing is being worked on more than 1 project also minimizes risks for example if you work on one project first and that project takes longer than expected you could run into issues with the second stakeholder also most likely want their project done holding one off due to another project can make them reconsider going ahead with the on what the projects are you might be able to leverage work done in one for the if they are similar then doing both at the same time could be of if you do them in sequence only the subsequent projects can benefit from the previous often projects are not a constant stream of sometimes developers are busy and sometimes if you only work on 1 project at a time a developer and other team members would likely be doing nothing while the more tasks are taking managing the time over more than one project allows teams to get more done in a shorter a developer i prefer working on multiple projects as long as the timelines are as long as not being asked to do both at the same time with no change in the schedule i am often if stuck on one project i can work on the it depends on the projects

 think the only really justified issue in your bunch is overuse of extension when important functionality is only accessible through extension sometimes hard for everyone in a group to find out about and use that about object initializers and the keyword seems very both are simple and predictable syntax that can be used to make code more and not clear to me how you see them being suggest you address concerns like this through coding if nobody can come up with good reasons to use new language then no need to use after

 think the stride size and row number limits can be calculated in i precalculated all resulting in the following static unsafe void bitmapdata point it is expected that the bitmap pixelformat is format24bpprgb but this could change in the const int pixelsize calculate total number of rows to var totalrow var rowsize starting point of copy srcptr destptr loop through each for i i draw the entire for j j advance each pointer by 1 destptr srcptr tested it thoroughly but you should be able to get that to have removed multiplication operations from the loop and removed most branchings so it should be somewhat me know if this helps

 think this is a common case of pattern you check your two they do exactly the same the only thing that changes is the keep things dry and overuse this pattern any here you gain a little bit of but then you also have 2 classes that pull their and probably gonna that is common when you learn a new technology or you want to apply it everywhere happens to every one of even if doing it harms the code readability and keep it response to the author comment on my did not try to make fun of or this is a common i did it many and learned it the hard not only with patterns but also with fancy new buzzword you name authors of the book themselves warn the readers not to overuse and the upvotes in this answer clearly indicate something if for some reason you still want to implement the my humble a superclass for both this superclass would be abstract and should contain the shared rate value of their child strategies and implement the abstract method in each subclass see that both methods are the but to make each concrete strategy always favor immutability as joshua bloch for remove the setter of provincialtaxrate and specify the value on constructor or directly in its create some static factory methods in the strategysuperclass so that you decouple your clients from the implementations or concrete strategies can very well be protected classes a pastie with some code to make the solution a bit more it	
 think this is a great begun a series of blog posts about it answer is correct in the narrowest let me rephrase in my own words implicitly including some of the is no value in operations that are not cpu there is little value in operations that are only cpu bound short periods of less a few hundred doing so will most likely cause program to be more and learning how to implement fine parallelism is complicated and it well is is true as far as it but i belive the answer is richer for a broader set of there are many reasons to use and then implicitly techniques in your production for it is a huge benefit to your users to move disk and network operations off your user interface has nothing to do with increasing the throughput of compute bound and everything to do with keeping a user interface you need a graphical ui here command line and server based can benefit for this as completely agree that taking a cpu bound operation and paralyzing it can often be a complex task requiring knowledge of fine grained cpu cpu instruction this can be classically i would argue that the need to do his is there are just not that many problems that need this kind of fine grained they do exist and may deal this this every but i would argue that in the day to day life of most this is pretty there are good reasons to learn the fundamentals of and thus can make your program more responsive from a user perspective by moving longer operations off the message loop for things that are not cpu it can often make sense to do them in can break up complex single threaded state machines into more procedural the os already does a lot for you and you can use libraries that are enabled operating systems and libraries are not magic i argue that it is valuable for most develops to learn the basics of this will let you write better software that your users are happier not every program should be or it is just fine for some things to be implemented in a simple single threaded take this as advice that every program should be use your own good judgment it can often be a valuable technique and very beneficial in many as mentioned i plan on blogging about this a bit starting feel free to follow along and post comments there as you feel	
 think this is possible because the clickonce process is handled i think they have a way to extend slightly ugly way to accomplish this would be to provide your own bootstrapped msi and have your clickonce deployment require that as a then have 2 apps show up your prereq msi and the actual clickonce

 think this might be a big reason databases are typically limited in functionality than local app engine up to 1000 simpledb times within 5 joining records two tables in a single query databases optimized for engine offers specialized storage query types such as database layer of a cloud can be abstracted as a layer within a stack but developers are most to use the local solution for both speed and niall

 think what he said was when you use prepared sql server could cache your query execution even if you modify some of the parameters on the executing the server could pick the wrong execution plan that would perform very also mentioned a new feature of sql server 2008 to force the engine to execution plans that he used to overcome this prepared the only issue i have is consider the following java sql from table where name like pstmt rs you would expect if you have an index on it will be used by the query it because praparedstatement must precompile and expect the for it it took me a while to figure this one it was causing my database to it santa	
 think what looking for is the dateformat try looking at can do something like df new date	
 think what swfobject allows you to do is to write the flashvars into the embed with the same result as if you were to hardcode the flashvars i think trying to change the hardcoded parts in your manner would be very similar to trying to change the flashvars during after the swf has already firefox may well be loading the swf once it hits the not giving the javascript a chance to change the read up on that might be cool if you are compiling the swfs	
 think what you are asking for is quite an efficient way in a web login purpose is to provide an easy way for to gain access to your services and should be easy and fast to so you should not make a user wait considering of the them will not be also has the potential to place a huge load on your server should there be a lot of concurrent users trying to log potential options would the ip for the end of the session for x number of unsuccessful login a course these are not the options but still i am sure more people will have more	
 think what you are looking for is the you would do is create an as2 wrapper swf that loads the as2 file that you want to you can add whatever functions or properties that you want to use in the original as2 file to the wrapper and using the call them from the as3 a bit of doing but the example he provides show how it	
 think what you have to do is find the linker input property page for your project and tell it to specifically ignore and then explicitly link to the version you want not sure what will happen if they have the same	
 think what you want is the attribute on your which takes an optional path to an error handler the default is you could add additional support for your specific exception	
 think working on the wrong level of the block does exactly what it it executes the closure once for each what you probably want instead is to use to find the right and then do the work you need to do on	
 think worth using xcode for a pure python although the xcode editor does python xcode does not give you any other benefit for writing a on os i would recommend as a text editor or eclipse with as a more

 think you are thinking about this in the wrong you be the error simply to log it further down the the cannonical way of doing this in python is to use the logging adapted from the bad display message raise gives a far more flexible logging system than relying on errors produced on you may not need to the exception if you can recover from the exception in some

 think you can just use swap clobbering matter to this would swap the previous contents of with and indexing returns a reference to the contained you can manipulate it just like any other if you want to individual you can just use or methods copying actually takes place when you assign a new set to the map create a copy of if you need to use the value of you can use the which will just shuffle pointers of the two have the contents of the previous

 think you cannot get this result from the data you have length triangle you have to get other like location of the points or the angles at the since the triangle is anthonywjones already pointed the inner triangle is similar to the outer the only thing you need is find the ratio between the can find it easily from the since triangles cqp and acs are h1 the thickness of the you compute and the ratio h1 is the ratio between the two the area of the inner triangle is then area of the outer	
 think you could also do something like and and put this at the end of the onload or call it stringbuilder sb new stringwriter sw new htmltextwriter htmltw new not sure if there are any potential issues with but it looks like it would this you could use a full featured instead of the maildefinition class which only supports text	
 think you could also try something like families in select from where group by	
 think you could look around and find but whether or not followed is an entirely different is open source software it costs you nothing to but afraid going to have to invest some time to determine if a package does what you relatively straightforward to determine how recently a gem has been released and how many times and with what frequency updates have these are indicators that the source is being actively maintained and that effort is going into its continuing you can also look at tests installed with the existence of bug tracking discussion groups or forums and the like in order to assess the degree of commitment from the and the amount of penetration and community around the what were you hoping value for some central authority that accredits the fitness for purpose of a it going to happen any time and on no bad

 think you need something like this test it for firebird and it works very thought there was a mysql version but no i see just this if it is just for i think that the answer given is	
 think you need to distinguish between the time taken to the server and the time for your process to handle for ping will simply measure the icmp response which is a network protocol if you take into account the tcp and then the subsequent processing by the that time period will be your it sounds like ping is what you in jdk 5 and you can host timeout status you would need to time that using or	
 think you need to restate your because if is an instance of it will also be an instance of and will return base derived base obj new typ	
 think you probably need to split this logic into two parts and check for null static bool if return if is return as return static bool if is return return null the isnull relying on the fact that valuetype objects be null by definition so if value happens to be a class which derives from we already know not on the other if not a value type then we can just compare value cast to an object against we could avoid the check against valuetype by going straight to a cast to but that would mean that a value type would get boxed which is something we probably want to avoid since it implies that a new object is created on the the isnullorempty checking for the special case of a for all other comparing the value already know is against default value which for all reference types is null and for value types is usually some form of zero these the following code behaves as you might public class public string mystring static void int i1 int i2 i3 i4 string s1 string s2 string s3 string s4 myclass mc1 new myclass mc2 public static void t public static bool public static bool	
 think you really should give vim a you quickly tried vi ten years i may understand you appreciate not really at first actually its real power is revealed when you start feeling comfortable with the movements and start making it your own with vim is familiar to you you may understand why it deserves to be	
 think you should be returning any http error rather custom exceptions that are useful to the client end of the application so the interface knows what had actually i try and mask real issues with 404 error codes or something to that	
 think you should have something similar is autogenerated from ria should then be an onloaded event when the async result has been can then say	
 think you should use firebug to find out what elements are taking time to sometimes large images can ruin the show the size of the image on screen always relative its download you could download the yahoo firefox plugin yslow and investigate if you have any slowing firebug should give you the best after loading firebug click on the tab to view the load time of each element in the	
 think you teach it but once basic concepts of programming are good example is the last stroustrup book principles and practice using where he teach how to make a usage and gui usage before even talking about think it will be a good reference for teaching because it is more natural to understand the way we build ideas instead of how much constraints management for we have to handle at the same time to make a software i really recommand you this book to have a fresh perspective about teaching fundamentals of

 think you would want to put it on the irepository repository if you are going after just the list of you could also add a ticket collection to the project entity and have that the this way you could retrieve the project from your irepository and if you wanted all the tickets simply hit this but if you are just going after just the tickets then you can work with them through the	
 think your approach sounds if your wcf services will only be used by your front end i would probably think about hosting the service layer in a windows service and use tcp you have to deal with iis and possibly no but that could require you to change your infrastructure requirements could still use port but you will be faced with other annoying issues related to using ports that iis normally you can start with binding and switch later anyway with minimal impact to the overall is the beauty of the services i would also consider publishing 1 simple facade on top of your two that way your client couple itself to the concepts of your oracle db and unix this debatable you only mentioned the technologies if the two systems represent distinct business domains then keeping them separate makes if you are only splitting them because they are two different systems then i would try to abstract those systems from the passing credentials i would recommend using an authorization policy in combination with for more help on this topic check out if you found it here is an to get you	
 think your best approach is simply to use the sendasync method of the smtpclient class to asynchronously send the client new can even pass in a delegate as the second parameter to the sendasync method which will act as a and be invoked when the sendasync method please see the example on the msdn site should give you the best of both worlds in that you can send the email asynchronously without tying up your main executing whilst also avoiding the complexities of spawning and managing your own threads writing a separate	
 think your best bet might be to use a aop framework like a codeproject article explaining part pervasive method interception and replacement for sealed types in any	
 think your best option is to use the built in localization resources of the you can read more about the mechanics of that for using a database to store your localised elements images and the this is certainly a common but i think mostely because developers understand getting data from a more than working with satellite assemblies and the there a number of problems with using a so name only a added complexity of deployment of the application addtional load on the database where do you store the localized messages to say that the database is down some sort of text file also carries with it some deployment but more importanly the percieved flexibility of making text changes the is somewhat over apart of spelling mistakes and awkward wording almost always be shipping a new build as the text of your app	
 think your idea will probably valid identifiers are made up of and which is in fact a proper subset of xml identifiers add and a bunch of unicode characters to the could try a construct like this to get a compile time int name braces limit the scope of the dummy variable to just that so you clutter your function with bogus probably the compiler optimizes the dummy variable out so no runtime when i use this macro in the following i get invalid int name char int 30 int bar return i replace with in the call to it compiles with no

 thinking about an idea for as well as learning ruby on rails eh i want something to allow a user to generate forms as then assign these templates as forms in a location in a tree then allow users to fill in instances of these forms and save the got two different thoughts as how to structure the currently thinking a template will have one or more and a section will have one or more fields and the field will then have attributes validation should this be described as linked tables section should i have one template that has a field called body that can be serialized in and out to xml or something to render ideas or comments even if totally on the wrong way to structure data for user generated form

 third option is the best for any you will probably wish to add more fields to your person so the first option is it is very likely that you will have a large number of persons to and will want to look up records quickly thus dumping them into a simple array is done in option is not a good idea third pattern gives you the option to use any string as an have complex person structures and get and set person records in a constant definitely the way to thing that option lacks is a stable deterministic ordering is the upside of option if you need i would recommend keeping an ordered array of person ids as a separate structure for when you need to list persons in the advantage would be that you can keep multiple such for different orderings of the same data	
 third party provided me a static lib to link with on solaris tried to compile with and failed at link suppose the issue is coming from the compiler i use or simply its version the std lib provided by the compiler could change from the version expected by the library afaik it could leads to errors at link could i know which compiler was used to generate this is there some tools doing some option in or an read some time ago that compilers use different mangling conventions when generating object files command line prints me well all function names from debug symbols in this static how does it work if my assumption is does have a way to resolve which convention is in use in a static or is it simply meaning that lib was generated by gnu as nm is a part of gnu binutils am not close to my workstation so i error output from the linker for the moment but i could copy them in a further there a way to know which compiler generated a static	
 this a real program or rather a sample to illustrate a it is not clear why you would restrict access to the artists and albums rather than just to individual media items or even think that the joins should cost you that any db system will do them cheaply enough when you are making a fairly simple criteria match on multiple the problem with putting that much security logic into queries is that it limits your ability to handle more complex drm issues that are sure to bound for what if the album is a collection from multiple what if the album contains a track which is a duet and i only have access to one view is that in those a convenient programming model with sensible exception is much more important than the performance of individual which you could always cache or optimize in the what you are trying to do with queries sounds like premature your programming model as flexible as define a sensible sense of then work on implementing the database and optimize queries after profiling the real

 this i think you need if is it you can pass that to insertbefore and it will act the same as no other element allowed inside a tbody than i i work for multiple once done one will now point to the row you just end up inserting all your rows in reverse need to remember the original if is a live dom every time you insert one of the rows into the new it removes it from the old you are destroying the list as you iterate over this is a common cause of other you process item 0 of the and in doing so remove it from the moving item 1 down into where item 0 next you access the new item which is the original item and the original item 1 never gets make a copy of the list in a normal if you know going to be a live you can actually use a simpler form of have to insert a when you think about inserting a set of elements at you want to be using a you set on a so have to set the rows on a table like then move them one by one into a then insertbefore the whilst this could theoretically be faster than appending into the final target table to less childnodes in practice by my testing it actually reliably significantly approach is an ie only extension you call insertadjacenthtml on the child of a in the same way as you set due to the ie you set it inside a somehow insertadjacenthtml works very slowly in this context for some mysterious the above method is about half the speed of the insertbefore for

 this is referred to as and a property on all container to do what you looking you can use a creation policy of is the creationpolicy of means that the container delays creating some or all descendants until they are a process which is known as deferred this policy produces the best startup time because fewer uicomponents are created this introduces navigation delays when a user navigates to other parts of the application for the first navigator containers such as and viewstack implement the policy by creating all their children but wait to create the deeper descendants of a child until it becomes the selected child of the navigator creationpolicy of means that the navigator containers immediately create deeper descendants for each rather than waiting until that child is for containers such as a vbox there is no difference between the and info careful with this flex picked auto as the default for a if your app grows the initialization time under will be

 thoughts on what the variable length struct idiom allows you to perform one free store allocation per which is half as many as would be required if contained a if you are allocating a large number of then performing half as many free store may very well be if you are also doing network then the time spent waiting for the network will probably be more structure represents a are you planning to from a socket directly into a if you probably need to consider byte are you going to have to convert from host to network byte order when sending and vice versa when receiving if then you could the data in place in your variable length if you converted this to use a it would make sense to write methods for serializing deserializing the these methods would transfer it a contiguous taking byte order into you may need to take alignment and packing into can never subclass if you then the member variables would overlap with the of and you could use p and since is a pod type and does not currently benefit from having its default constructor and its destructor the benefit of doing so is that the global handles errors using the global if that matters to is possible to make the variable length struct idiom work with the new and delete but not you could create a custom that takes an array length by implementing operator unsigned int but you would still have to set the bitlength member if you did this with a you could use the slightly redundant expression p to allocate a the only benefit i see compared to using global and would be that clients of your code could just call instead of wrapping the in separate functions of calling is fine as long as they get called

 to going ahead with cryptography is from experience after having seen vulnerabilities in encryption most of the vulnerabilities are due to the same reason the data transfer was protected by encryption with a secret but the key itself was exchanged in an insecure solves the problem of not just secure key but also of secure data protects your sensitive information by using assymmetric key cryptography to exchange the symmetric key used to encrypt information back and once the session has been the symmetric key is generated at and is a shared secret between the client and the it is this key that is used to encrypt all other traffic once the session is ready for transfer of public and private keys are used only to exchange this shared the only known way to compromise the shared key is to compromise the private key that the secret key can then be in it requires negligence or malice on the part of the server you roll your own encryption you must exchange the symmetric in a secure the easiest way to do so is to use the harder way is to implement your own assymmetric key exchange cryptography

 to write programs correctly is extremely difficult and time the first step replace the implementation with one that use multiple threads at carefully put threading back in and only you discover a genuine need for when figured out some very simple safe ways to do a implementation that works reliably is far better than a broken threaded ready to favour designs that use queues to transfer work items between threads and take care to ensure that those work items are accessed only by one thread at a to avoid just spraying blocks around your code in the hope that it will become it two code paths will acquire the same locks in a different and everything will grind to a halt every two on a this is especially likely if you combine threads with firing and you hold the lock while you fire the event the handler may take out another and now you have a pair of locks held in a particular what if taken out in the opposite order in some other this is such a big and difficult subject that i think it is potentially misleading to give a few pointers in a short answer and say you sure not the intention of the many learned people giving answers but that is the impression many get from summarised this is a very nicely worded summary this also comes the biggest is that can lead to vastly more having multiple threads not in itself create the interaction between the that creates this whether or not the interaction and can result development as well as ongoing susceptibility to and for it pays to keep interaction in a simple or not use multithreading all unless you have a penchant for and summary from traditional way of dealing with concurrency by letting a bunch threads loose in a single address space and then using locks to try cope with the resulting data races and coordination problems probably the worst possible in terms of correctness

 tried both zend framework and and my impression is that mvc is the easiest to develop zf takes a lot of time to learn and it also takes too much time my to set zf also limits you in many making you build large workarounds for things that ought to be implemented by default in the many of the libraries zf offers are also made for very specific use and are difficult to asp you can have an application up and running in no any changes you want to make to the default setup is richly you also have the advantage of a programming language like the mvc pattern combined with a real programming language makes it easy to unit especially good if into test driven my pros list of mvc localization and globalization with the pages is much easier to use and more flexible than the layout model in get all the good things from like sitemap and the entity framework nhibernate the cost of the server and the many hosting companies provide dedicated servers at fairly decent

 tried your test page in ie 7 and 8 and could not reproduce the things to and verify the url being requested by the meta ensure it is in fact make the query string to unique for pages 1 and 2 so you can verify which request is causing the message box to sure all affected browsers are seeing the site in the same security zone the status bar across the bottom and ensure all instances of ie say either or if browsers in one zone are working but those in another are you can try getting them all in the same internet explorer without any all programs accessories system tools internet explorer or run iexplore does the same thing happen on the afflicted this story is unrelated to your specific but a couple of years ago i had one user whose session by a session was not surviving in a secondary it turned out that a popular cursor she had downloaded and installed was preventing the sharing of cookies between two different ie the point of the story is that ie can sometimes cause strange behaviour you associate with an best to rule them out by trying it with in no all machines are running the same build of internet explorer about internet explorer or go to concerned about the nature of the saying that visiting page 1 sets a timer to refresh the then you navigate away from that and the refresh still occurs at the designated even though navigated away from the page containing the iframe which contains the meta navigating away from page 1 should stop the timer on the initial iframe why i think you should use fiddler a unique query to verify it is the request from the iframe on page 1 causing the

 true that you need to do more in mvc to get some of the same basic very automatic functionality you became accustomed to in in the long run you end up with more thing broken about webforms is the whole postback and how many hoops you have to jump through to implement something simple webforms think one excellent example is my wanted to make a or record message in a webforms turns out you have to do some really scary stuff just to get this simple functionality to because have a normal way to do this in and to do a custom fighting against the hidden functionality in this would be no still have to write the functionality but have much more control over your page

 try to answer my own it in the first easiest way out of this situation is to refactor the code to avoid the problem are two obvious ways to do instance does not create a but instead relies on external code to supply then will no longer the instance and is not responsible for disposing of externally created instance could be supplied via the constuctor or by setting the class somedisposableobject no creation public public somedisposableobject get return set the instance main issue with the posted code is that the ownership is at dispose time the class cannot tell who owns the it could be the instance that it created or it could be some other instance that was created externally and via the if it tracks this and knows for certain that it is dealing with the instance that it then it still cannot dispose of it as other classes may now have a reference to it that they obtained from the public the code can be refactored to avoid making the instance public by removing the property then the issue goes if it be for some reason the code cannot be refactored in these ways i stipulated in the then in my opinion you are left with some fairly difficult design dispose of the you choose this approach then you are effectively declaring that will take ownership of the instance when the property is makes sense in some particularly where is clearly a transient or subservient however it should be documented carefully as it requires the calling code to be aware of this transfer of may be more appropriate to use a rather than a as the method name can be used to give a further hint about class somedisposableobject new public somedisposableobject get return set if null public void if dispose if still the original this approach you would track whether the instance was changed from the one originally created by and only dispose of it when it was the here the ownership model is remains the owner of its own but if an external instance is supplied then it remains the responsibility of the external code to dispose of approach best reflects the actual situation but it can be difficult to implement the client code can still cause issues by performing operations like acontainer new originalinstance new a new instance was swapped a method then the original instance was unfortunately the will have called on the original instance when it was so it is now give up and let the gc handle is obviously less than if the class really does contain some scarce resource then not disposing of it promptly will definitely cause you it may also represent the most robust approach in terms of how the client code interacts with as it requires no special knowledge of how treats the ownership of the you know that the disposable resource actually scarce on your system then this may actually be the best commenters have suggested that it may be possible to use reference counting to track if any other classes still have a reference to the this would be very useful as it would allow us to dispose of it only when we know it is safe to do so and otherwise just let the gc handle i am not aware of any api for determining the reference count of an if there is one then please let me

 trying to choose a project management and collaboration software for our next project and would like to know your opinion on sharepoint alternatives like basecamp or activecollab the i would prefer the that are important to sharing manuals forums hate when important information is lost in the integration would be nice to have but probably neither nor activecollab currently support do things like time tracking are less important to us nice to i compare the two i see these strong points and feature of sharepoint is office for specification is much better authored in ms word with image compared to a plain html textarea and some plain text we also use outlook quite extensively so it would be good if we could leverage this is web based and has a slick user interface which is important for adoption in our company our devs find the solution easy to work they will not use my boss also kind of likes easy solutions and activecollab wins easily in this activecollab is something like few hundreds dollars one time but not too sure about if the basic version would be enough for us think we need the full ms office sharepoint and in that we need only windows server licence we and a sql server licence sql server express or do we need at least workgroup this means that even sharepoint need to be too expensive if we go for the lowest there anyone who did the same comparison and could possibly provide more sharepoint vs

 understand iterators we first need to understand are specialist objects which provide one with the means to move through an ordered list of items one at a time same kind of thing is sometimes called a the framework provides two important interfaces relating to ienumerator and objects which implement ienumerator are themselves they support the following property which points to a position on the method which moves the current item one along the method which moves the current item to its initial position is before the first the other implement the introduced the which is when the object either directly or the compiler returns the be combined ingredient of block is the yield there is one big difference between do not implement the reset the reset method on point of iterators is to allow the easy implementation of where a method needs to return either an enumerator or an enumerable class for an ordered list of it is written so as to return each item in its correct order using the

 understanding you you want to the transaction isolation to assuming mssql has true serializability might true serializability is rarely needed and often quite costly to this will guarantee that even if you execute many transactions at the end result will be identical to executing one one is usually waiting for it to then executing another and so be there are often subtle be they actual bugs or in database serializable since this stuff is really tricky to get especially nasty is the fact that some databases and postgresql use and i know the postgres lists were recently discussing these issues with their really implement serializable going instead for what should be called snapshot isolation this gives of the benefits of serializable with minimal performance but no good if you fall into that serializable is not an either because it do what you want or for some other you can always have each sp take an exclusive lock before doing its dirty this might lead to deadlocks or timeouts and require other tuning so kind of an ugly but it should do the

 use any metrics which can be calculated use and similar heuristics to detect bad and then fix it as soon as i have noticed i have any checklist for looking problems mostly a gut feeling that code looks and then reasoning that why it is messy and figuring out a simple refactorings like giving a more descriptive name to a variable or extracting a method take only a few more intensive such as extracting a might take up to a an hour or two which case i might leave a todo comment and refactor it important heuristic that i use is responsibility it makes the classes nicely in some cases i use the size of the class in lines of code as a heuristic for looking more whether a class has multiple in my noticed that when writing most of the classes will be less than 100 lines and often when the size approaches 200 the class does many unrelated things and it is possible to split it so as to get more focused cohesive	
 use apply in useful to force row by row processing instead of a if you have to do in one place it ws more efficient using profiler to view because the optimiser treated the udf as a black box and applied the filter as i udf is an inline table valued function that when in a join was worse because the optmiser looked at the query as a whole and applied the filter ina different i use it sparingly or on code that does not run and verify that it does not kill really i accept the hit to gain encapsulation only goes so far in at some point you lose the set based	
 use both products and they are quite different from each i have been a long time user of active reports and have loved but when it came time to select a reporting tool we did not want to spend a bunch of so we decised to get their ddr it took me a couple of weeks to get used to it as i kept trying to use it like active not a good once you get used to it it does a decent there are some things that they need to do to improve the here are the things that stand cannot access the control collection in the code this is a huge problem if you want to change anything like data binding inside the database connection have to be refreshed if you repopen the report int he this took a while to figure out and we wondered why our fields would not show up in the preview mode when re reloaded the new tech support is they were bought out recently and now when you call tech supprt you get someone tht has no knowledge that always tells you that someone will call you of the time you get no call the otehr of the time you get a sample emaild to you that has nothing to do with your now this is accorss the board with both they used to have great tech i hope they fix are the main problems and i know they are workign to solve the like i said we use boh ddr and active if you need to do complicated reports stick with active if they are simple and you do not want to spend a lto fo money then ddr works i see ddr getting better with each release but it will take a while to get the knks worked my

 using you have a lot of freedom to move memory i think that using a separate thread is probably not the best or way my guess is be better off using a type of incremental copying where on each or you compact forwards or backwards in some number of allocated with the number of bytes that you copy depleting a that is periodically reset to its initial value on each screen course only whole blocks are idea is that copying a given number of bytes takes a fairly predictable amount of so you can estimate how many bytes of copying you can safely perform per screen and limit yourself to if enough time in the a call to or will completely defragment otherwise it will defragment it as much as possible in the given the time are some questions leaving unresolved here exactly how to compact the a standard copying allocator can just start allocating from the then copy everything to the back up memory at the when memory runs but you have that freedom you might need some heuristics to decide whether to move blocks forward or the important thing is to avoid oscillations same block being moved forwards then backwards on successive calls to or

 variables or constants are allocated on the their existence lasts only during the function execution and their value is lost as soon as the function allocation and assignment take place each time the function is a local variable or constant static means that its value will be kept from one call to the this is achieved by allocating it globally instead of on the allocation and assignment are performed only which in case of big data structures in frequently called functions may lead to performance	
 variadic function is only weakly type in the function signature does not provide enough information for the compiler to know the type of each argument assumed by the this is on win32 and on it has to vary in size like that in order to perform its defined so for a variadic function to pull arguments out correctly which are of type the caller had to make certain that the compiler could tell that the argument was of that type at in the calling is a constant of type there is no defined suffix letter that marks a constant to be of type you could hide that fact inside a but that would be no clearer than writing at the call appears to work partially because of the actual calling convention used in from the examples we can tell that the first four integral arguments to a function are passed in and the rest on the that allowed count and the first three variadic parameters to be read it only to you are actually standing squarely in undefined behavior and really does mean anything can other anything can happen variadic functions are implicitly a special burden is placed on the coder to make certain that the type of each argument known at compile time matches the type that argument will be assumed to have at run some cases where the interfaces are well it is possible to warn about type for gcc can often recognize that the type of an argument to match the format and issue a but doing that in the general case for all variadic functions is

 wanting to enter into the debate of wiring up event handlers in code or in sufice it to that i seem to recall there was a kind of to feature in the xaml editor for silverlight clearly been a while since i have been codeing but i was sure it was a simple process of adding an event handler in the code behind file for a control on the xaml somebody tell me if there a way to generate an event handler from the xaml editor in a silverlight

 was a book i read last year by steve sanderson that briefed me on ddd even though the book was on mvc as a he really focused on the in mvc as a true and pure domain model using almost the book on modeling approaches i very much one thing he approached was using value objects in the context of aggregate roots he also showed how to use linq to represent the as well as the value point he noted the limitation of linq that it must have an identity on every including value he acknowledged it broke the pure domain model it was the only way to get it to work with was to give your value object an make that identity internal so it is not exposed outside of your this will allow you to link and share your objects using linq in your while not exposing it to the client layers it is as though they are value objects entity framework i believe suffers from the same example is class isdbgenerated autosync public int entityid public string insert business rules if need class make your identity isdbgenerated autosync internal int valueobjectid everything else public string myproperty

 was a little surprised that i find this question on principles should i consider if i want to incorporate elements of someone website into my other the web is a fairly open in the sense that the dominant and javascript are distributed in source if you see something cool on a you in look at the source and copy and paste the bits you in i seem to remember reading somewhere that html was designed this way to foster innovation in page but on the other someone put in the hard work of designing that website and translating the design into just common decency to give people credit when you reuse significant portions of their and perhaps the page author holds a copyright on the page source know exactly how copyright protection applies not a so how do you balance the ease of using parts of other web pages with the rights of the page reason i ask is that i was recently advising an acquaintance whose company wanted to redesign their they were very impressed with the home page of the mit department of architecture and wanted to do something i suggested that my acquaintance contact mit and ask whether they would object to his company using the same look and feel as the of after a couple of weeks he got no so now is it ethical legal for his company to just go ahead and take the design elements they want from the mit or should they stay away from it without explicit or would it have been okay from the beginning was it unnecessary to try contacting mit the answer will also have implications for how i design my own so interested to find out what the so community has to for reusing elements of a web

 was able to solve my problem in a slightly different let me first recap what my situation is have two droppable div objects that are very close to each other on the have a draggable that does not have a unique this draggable can be dropped on my droppables time and time again it get if that makes any a draggable is on top of two currently the jquery behaviour is that the draggable will hit both this is an undesired effect for expected the draggable should fall on the first droppable and should not get triggered for any other subsequent droppable which is tsarray new drop i i if 150 empty it for do any logic you require basic idea is that when a draggable is dropped on two the event timestamp of each droppable event are very close to each they are milliseconds i simply do a check to ensure that there is a substantial time difference between

 was hoping this jquery would but it added a comment to his but so you might not see it let me explain my i want a type of event to be fired when the user either pauses his completes his not the user is actively dragging the window resize i have a fairly complex and time consuming onresizehandled function i need to but not run 100 times just because the user widened the window by 100px and the event was fired for ever pixel of i guess a best bet would be to handle it once the user has completed the resize event firing multiple times while dragging the resize

 was looking through a report on my code base and one of the patterns that was triggered was for an empty block the synchronized blocks are far subtle and hard to use correctly most people and synchronized blocks are almost never better solution than less my case it occurred because the contents of the block had been commented but the statement was still in what situations could an empty block achieve correct threading what situations could an empty synchronized block achieve correct threading	
 was missing a space before also got the wrong number of around your which will confuse made yourself a nice little security hole from inside sql if one of the parameters contains an apostrophe your sqlstatement will break and any rogue sql in the parameter name would be can use the replace function to double up single quotes to prevent this and like quotename is needed if the column name contains characters or is a reserved cleaner quite approach to generating the sql than tediously replaceing every string literal yourself is to use for select casenumber from where and and like int if can only have a small number of different you can use a workaround to avoid having to do any of this laborious nonsense at casenumber from and case when then when then like rather good exploration of sql statements in for more background and some of the risks you

 was some code like convenience to make things more legible in the following float x go on to use x in have been told that the float is and should just be a plain float or const could not think of a compelling reason other than have to type it seems to me that in some cases the original could be since compiler might not allocate extra stack space to the other originally i could validly in the second case i the original seems to communicate intent in my since the whole point of a reference is to make an alias to another anyone give me examples of where the float version is worse than a plain or in some tangible float x considered	
 was the first version of python to include the clause for for find that the python docs usually does a good job of documenting when features were but i seem to find the info on this help that and are particularly difficult terms to google for on a programming version of python added the else clause for for	
 was the last version to provide support for java so still widely used by shops that made the transition to or my stuck with deploying to an older weblogic best way to gain performance improvements is to use a mapping rather than having castor use reflection to your the mapping file can contain explicit xml element to java class and omit any translations you are not interested for if an xml record contains a billing information along with a history of the last 100 but all you care about is the billing you can explicitly map the appropriate xml elements to your billing information castor will ignore the remainder of the xml speeding up the marshalling final tip is to download the source code for castor even if you plan on building the code the documentation for been kept up to so some new features that appear to have been introduced in and higher have actually been added to castor as a quick comparison of the documentation and code will let you see what improvements have been recently made to castor

 was thinking about this the other day and wanted to see what the so community had to say about the it stands right now common lisp is getting some attention as a web development and with good reason which sure you are already was wondering how one would go about using a library in a shared environment in a similar fashion to i set up something like sbcl as an interperter to interpret fasl files like python or what would be the best way to use libraries for come as asdf installable but it would be a stupid amount of overhead to require and install the library each and every time a request is in mind this is for shared would it be best to install system wide copies of the libraries for use in reduces but there may be problems with using the correct version of the allow users a control to install local copies for more no version tell them to wrap it into a module and load it on demand like python does not sure this can be done with just being able to load a library for use would be the best but i think a lot of them are designed to be used this looking to hear your the best way to use libraries in a shared hosting

 was wondering how i should go about writing an xml data layer for a fairly simple php web the reasons for this server is not data schema that can be expressed in like the idea of having a self contained without server would possibly want to abstract it to a small framework for reuse in other schema resembles a simple book catalog with a few lookup tables plus it is quite simple to size of the main xml file is in the range of 100kb to but it could grow at some point to am actually considering extending my model classes to handle xml i fetch data with a combination of xmlreader and like function new xpath returns an return instead of loading the whole xml file in i create a simplexml object for each section and run an xpath query on that the function returns an array of simplexml for conservative search i would probably break on first found questions i have to ask you consider this as a viable even for a medium to large data there any to keep in when handling xml in the above code scale for large files inserts and updates in large xml files be handled in a low overhead you suggest an alternative data format as a better as a data layer for a php

 was wondering if it was a common practice to salt and hash a password like is concatenation and e uses rsa for primarily asking this question for transport of a password database online storage where the server would have the private key to decrypt the encrypted password at all know that a cryptographic hash should be but an brute force attack on weak passwords would easily reveal a to eventually decrypt a record in this the server will know the length of padding and simply take away padding to reveal is not a typical but i find a reference as to someone having to properly transport a password database and defend against an should one defend against an brute force password	
 was wondering what people are using for logging in have log4net but am looking to do it async and to a a nice are the popular logging to a database	
 was wondering whether using a and braces approach to programming and to data validation in particular was good practice or this came about from the following was creating a form and i added listeners to all the fields which should mean that the button is only enabled if all the fields in the form have valid i was then writing the code which was run when the button is pessimistic side of me decided that belt and braces never hurt anyone and it hurt to validate the form again in case a bug in my form then i know what to put in if the validation if i do something like i have to create code to display an error message which should never be anyone maintaining this code in future is then going to worry about and possibly be confused by this in theory needless the last thing i want is someone wondering why this particular dialog is never option at the other end of the scale throw new should never i feel dirty even typing that but perhaps a good reason to use it which i have finally i ended up the downside of that is that not really belt and braces since the braces there at so if there is a bug in the code my trousers are still going to fall down as it maybe i have the extra validation at but still a part of me which thinks it be interested to hear what you do in similar the question is asking what is the best way to ensure the form returns valid assume that the output of the form is validated again before it ends up in the database and so belt and braces programming good practice or just introducing needless

 watch quite a bit of all sorts on a nokia n800 internet support for mp4 is a little flaky at the but if willing to transcode it to a different format	
 way been approaching it is to have a display layer that knows nothing about the gameworld its only job is to recieve an ordered list of objects to draw onto the screen that all fit a uniform format for a graphic so for if a 2d your display layer will receive a list of images along with their scaling and source and whatever other attributes a display object could the view may also be responsible for recieving high level mouse interactions with these displayed objects and dispatching them somewhere but important that the view layer not know anything sementically about what it is that only that some kind of square with a surface and some the next layer down is a program whose job it is simply to generate a list of these objects in helpful if each object in the list has some kind of unique as it makes certain optimisation strategies possible in the view generating a list of display objects is a much less daunting sort of task than trying to figure out for each sort of character how its going to physically render sorting is simple your display object generating code just needs to generate the list in the order that you and you can use whatever means you need to to get our display object list each prop and npc has two a resource database and a character the database assistant presents for each character a simple interface from which each character can pull up any etc that the character will probably want to come up with a fairly uniform interface for fetching the but going to vary a little from object to a tree or a rock need as much stuff as a fully animated npc for you need some way of generating an instance for each type of you might implement this dichotomy using your built in or depending on your you may need to work a little beyond for having each resource database be an instance of a resource database and each character instance being an instance of a this saves you from writing a chunk of code for every single little object in the this way you only need to write code for broad categories of and only change little things like which row of a database to fetch images forget to have an internal object representing your then your job to query each character about where they are in relation to the it is basically going around each character instance and asking for its display do you look and where are character instance in turn has its own little resourcey databasey assistant thing to so each character instance has available to it all the information it needs to tell the camera what it needs to leaves you with a set of character instances in a world more or less oblivious to the nitty gritty of how they are to be displayed on a physical and more or less oblivious to the nitty gritty of how to fetch image data from the hard this is it leaves you with as clean a slate as possible for a sort of platonically world of characters in which you can implement your game logic without worrying about things like falling off the edge of the think of what sort of interface you would like if you were to put a scripting language into your game simple as possible as grounded in a simulated world as without worrying about little technical implementation details what this strategy lets you the separation of concerns lets you swap out the display layer with whatever technology you open software adobe nintendo without having to fuss around too much with the other you can actually swap out the database layer to do things like reskin all the or depending on how you built swap in a completely new game with new content that reuses the bulk of the character collision path finder code that you wrote in the middle	
 way could be this user throws callproceduresserviceexception stored procedure for getting hours def def try def sql procedure hourinmonth in in in hour new was catch throw new sql procedure return hour my app it works	
 way done in should soon be a merged into that will provide a lookup for exactly this type of query	
 way for a small dump your database to sql and add it to your then every time you change add the changes in the dump can then use diff to see changes between not to mention have comments explaining your this will also make you virtually immune to mysql one downside seen to this is that you have to remember to manually add the sql to your you can train yourself to always but be careful if you work with missing an update could be a pain later could be mitigated by creating some elaborate script to do it for you when submitting to subversion but a bit much for a one man in the year gone by since this had to implement a versioning scheme for mysql for a small manually adding each change was seen as a cumbersome much like it was mentioned in the so we went with dumping the database and adding that file to version we found was that test data was ending up in the dump and was making it quite difficult to figure out what had this could be solved by dumping the schema but this was impossible for our projects since our applications depended on certain data in the database to eventually we returned to manually adding changes to the database only was this the simplest but it also solved certain issues that some versions of mysql have with normally we would have to dump the development remove any test log certain names where applicable and only then be able to create the production by manually adding changes we could control exactly what would end up in a little at a so that in the end everything was ready and moving to the production environment was as painless as	
 way i can think of is to use directory so whenever it found out a file is created in the folder it opens it checks the file type and executes it if it is an you do have to watch out for incomplete file uploads	
 way i have done this is to have an absolute layout and then just update the object position as it is you have to implement dragging if the widgets have a natural order toolbar where you want to be able to drag buttons you can stack an absolute layout on top of the toolbar and when the drag you add it to the absolute layout and when it you add it back to the original layout in the new	
 way i see it is the google app engine basically provides a sandbox for you to deploy your app as long as it is written with their requirements amazon gives you a virtual machine with a lot more flexibility in what can be done but probably more work on your side ms new azure seems to be going down the gae but replace python with	
 way i see this you should return a 200 because it should be a valid say one of your urls is and that url displays a specific item in your a user enters what do we expect the action to to list all of the items in your of course at least a paginated your url structure and how directory levels and parameters relate to one	
 way i use a viewmodel is somewhat in my case it actually wraps the model class passing most of the data on to the that way all standard business rules in the model still work the way they are supposed to right the viewmodel only exposes those properties actually needed for data binding or other ui additionally the viewmodel might contain other used for data using your customer public class customerviewmodel private customer public customer return if if void propertychangedeventargs if public string get return set public string get return set public string get return firstname public static var result new var customers foreach customer in model customer return public event propertychangedeventhandler private void if new class customer public int id public string firstname public string lastname public int numberofcontracts public static customers new customers new customer firstname lastname numberofcontracts 23 customer firstname lastname numberofcontracts 22 customer firstname lastname numberofcontracts 33 customer firstname lastname numberofcontracts 2 customer firstname lastname numberofcontracts 5 return inotifypropertychanged public event propertychangedeventhandler in your ui you bind using the following code in the viewmodel does become somewhat large but a lot can be put in a base class and all properties that go to the model are exactly the same t4

 way is to bundle these things into an artifact using the assembly then you can use the dependency plugin to unpack these files where you there are also copy goals in the dependency plugin to copy	
 way is to enable webservice trace by wcf services do not report detailed information as service errors are technology specific to that service and should not transcend the service you would need to write additional code to disclose detailed exception enabling service tracing will allow you to log service calls and and see the stack without the additional and polluting your client with service exception quickest way to do this is to use the wcf service configuration editor tools in once you run the open config file that contains your service in the editor go to diagnostics menu and click clicking on the trace level options will bring up an dialog set the trace level to click on servicemodeltracelistener and check the callstack option maybe change the path of the log file for your you double click the file that is microsoft service trace viewer will fire up that will show you what the service is	
 way is to just add the to the collection and use a to control how the item is class private readonly new public string name public return var people new var kent new name name	
 way is to use nscalendar and hour	
 way java finds the class in which to run void is by the name passed to the java executable the so not possible to have main run unless the right name was unless the main that is found calls something like or uses the class loader to find as main is static and static functions the whatever main is called is called because main was called on that so in your the name passed in the args to in just the name of the class that function is never an and so never need to find the	
 way the character before in this can also be used to feed data into the programs standard input as well as reading its standard	
 way the defines if the server knows how to support the it that in requires it to return a partial response code with a when it returns content to it will simply ignore the header in your and return a 200 response might seem but are you sure crafting a valid http request all too i forget to specify in the or forget to specify the range such as and if all you want to do is then just send a head request instead of a get same same just instead of if you receive a know is and otherwise get a	
 way to add custom config you require more than just simple is to use a within that for the schema you defined you need a configurationelementcollection as default collection with no which contains a as class userelement isrequired true public string get return set isrequired true public string get return set isrequired true public string get return set internal string get return email additemname collectiontype class userelementcollection protected override configurationelement return new protected override object configurationelement element return element public void userelement element element public void public int userelement element return element public void userelement element element 0 public void int index index public userelement int index get return index index null index value class userinfosection private static readonly configurationproperty new private static configurationpropertycollection new static options public userelementcollection get return kept the userelement class although it really should follow the pattern of declaring each property fully as described in excellent codeproject as you can see it represents the elements in your config you userelementcollection class simply supports having more than one including the ability to items from the collection if you want to modify it at there is the userinfosection which simply stats that it has a default collection of up is a sample of the you can in this example included some elements in the also added settings to say they can be defined at we need to know how to update them at the following code shows an userconfig userinfosection as userelement new userelement above code will create a new file if buried deep inside the folder for the instead you want the new user added to the file simply change the parameter for the method to you can reasonably although finding this information required a bit of	
 way to do it is by the the 2nd argument of the function is a context selector that tells it where to by default that is the entire but you can specify something like a if no context is looks for dom elements within the context of the current html if you do specify a such as a dom element or jquery the expression will be matched against the contents of that what you have will the above is the optimal way of doing speed difference for your average use case will be i just prefer specifying the context whenever	
 way to handle this is to use events and this will end up creating multiple but it will do so in a manner that means you explicitly create if you create an event handler and add it to the datareceived event of each then when any port receives the event handler will be called on a separate this means the method must be and that access to any shared data structures must be protected against concurrent handler routine will do something like the readexisting to get the data	
 way to load the user control is to override call and then call your loadcontrol if you need to place the usercontrol is a specific place a placeholder on the page and add your control to the place holders control can also just add the user control directly to the the control as register then add it in as	
 way to provide headers and footers that appear invariant is via css here is an example of a fixed footer the 1px solid want to make sure that you add some to your page divs that fill the main portion of the to leave room for the fixed footer with a header using does actually stay on the page because the positioning is so tight and it will appear as if it does unless your page loads take too i know if this is what facebook does but it will give you much the same	
 way to view the actual query is by using sql	
 way twisted is definitely not what if the game trying to script is a purely based game then you may use something like and so on in order to simulate browser if a flash game your best bet is reversing the parse and elaborate the data as you	
 way which optimizes programmer time and in my all users who have items which are both red and black but no other do you are expecting to be looping through a metric truckload of users then need to sql it sql is not my test before from users inner join on inner join items on group by having i think that evil mess grabs every combination winnows down to users who have items of exactly 2 distinct means need do can probably eliminate the need for the ruby here totally but the sql is going to get seven flavors of oh	
 way would be to extend your website application and to attach different providers to different i think should be something like membership you can but i guess not what looking way would be to build your own which internally retrieves groups from multiple	
 way would be to generate all possible strings of length where n is 0 and goes to test each string with the once 10 matches are is obviously very	
 way you have it implemented is an acceptable way to do what you need to one way to improve your way of doing this would be to use on the dictionary rather than a second object used to synchronize the that rather than passing around an extra the resource itself keeps track of whether a lock on own a separate object can be useful in some such as synchronizing access to outside but in cases like this	
 way you will enter the if the variable is set and is or the variable is set and not null	
 ways i can think pretty or natural the problems are that there is no standard control in and there is no control data to use to manage layout in a standard generate a dummy say using and modulo this to filter the dataset results into bind each filtered set to side by side use a matrix control in a will split pairs of rows about to side by use the rectangle grouping to split into need a dummy column again to group on but going up 2 how to do generate the dataset as 2 or pivot using a and modulo 2 tend to the 3rd option or 1st

 wbemscripting objects are not marked as for and rightly if they any web page could figure out what processes you are terminate and even launch new talk about a security wbemscripting objects are made for use in for use in a web you have access to the client try running your code from a file using or the client machine is within your network and you know its you could also try running the script just replace the period in the the so if the remote name is you should change the line this would require you to run the script from a file using wscript or you could try to lower internet security settings on the client but only do this if you never surf the big bad internet with that since open up your your entire pc and all of the network connected to it to all kinds of unsavoury

 we are storing most of our data as json this works very well with hadoop on the backend and is easy to handle in ruby on the front my data types fit the natural pattern for lets say i have a class pet and a process feedpet that feeds a i also have a process walkdog that only applies to which is a kind of my data is organized such that i never need to worry about trying to walk a pet that a i would like to do is have pet and dog extends with dog having an additional method but i figure out how to map this to i have a class pet with a species data so the walkdog process would call instead of can create a dog extends and i can serialize that to json using the jackson the json object will have a leash but assume that i want to feed all the all pets have a so the feedpet process deserializes the objects to but this loses the leash walkdog process can do this because it knows all of its input is going to be so it can read it as a dog and write it back out as a there any way to serialize java objects to json such that i can preserve their thinking something like rails single table but it would have to be something that the json libraries or inheritance in json with java and

 went through this recently while decoupling much the same thing from our ui can see my progress and my a does represent business data pulled directly from the business logic turns that data into a truly useful business first is to decouple the datatable from the business can do that by creating objects and that make up datatables and collections of and then you can make a listview that displays those i cover the latter steps in the links i posted and the former steps are as easy as the a class that will represent your through your datatable or however you retrieve the and shove those fields into properties of that object that that list to the gridview or listview to way your listview or gridview be tightly coupled to the method that you are retrieving your what happens if you decide to get your data from a json query or a xml file later then have to build this into 1 getting data from are multiple methods to get data from a no way i can go through all of them i assume that you already know how to retrieve data from a and if you there are a few to pretend connected to the and are using an to retrieve pick up the private void foos if else catch throw new column does not exist in that you can return a list by going through that process in a loop that targets the you do pretend that your being returned is a if you do and follow the first link i gave you can replace with and achieve the same result minor the class just contains the column names in the so you have one place to change them case you were update based on can always insert an intermediate in this insert a business layer between the datatable and the and discussed what do but a datatable is not a business it is a visual representation of a you transport that to the ui layer and call it they say you have to

 what are the downsides favouring immutable objects in incompatibility with orm or presentation based frameworks are complicated by immutable objects since they constructor are no default arguments in which forces us to always provide all of the necessary dependencies overriding can be argument names are not usually available through which forces us to depend on argument order for dependency immutable objects is still a boring the compiler should take care of the implementation as in it possible to design a system object that predominately uses immutable immutable objects makes great building blocks for other objects favor since much easier to maintain the invariant of a complex object when you can rely on its immutable the only true downside to me is about creating many temporany objects concat was a problem in the

 why that called the stack to trigger is telling you what to acquire your resource in a i would one one utsttc is just one application of raii is much management resource is anything that needs cleanup after studies of projects across many platforms show the majority of bugs are related to resource management and particularly bad on windows to the many types of objects and resource management is particularly complicated due to the combination of exceptions and for a peek under the see guarantees that the destructor is called and only the constructor relying on raii can solve many nasty problems the average programmer might not even be aware here are a few examples beyond the local variables will be destroyed whenever i us start with an overly simplistic class employing explicit file if throw the only reason we are checking the file pointer for is because it might have been moved it is not needed to check against a failed because the destructor is never executed when the constructor if the following technicalities can be skipped on the first they are not crucial to understanding the basic idea of if you plan to implement your own raii it is absolutely essential that you read on it does not make sense to copy a file hence we disallow the otherwise implicitly generated copy the following operations enable transfer of and require compiler support for rvalue a a resource is from one object to file file return construction fails an no other member function not even the destructor gets avoids using objects in an invalid it already makes life easier before we even use the let us have a look at temporary filehandle are three error cases to no file can be only one file can be both files can be opened but copying the files in a would have to handle all three cases releases resources that were even when multiple resources are acquired within one let us aggregate some filehandle this logger can write to two files at const if throw constructor of will fail if constructor fails could not be constructor fails could not be or writing to the files inside constructor body in any of these destructor will be called so we cannot rely on destructor to release the but if was its destructor will be called during cleanup of the simplifies cleanup after partial all problems can be solved with raii and smart pointers is sometimes unwieldy when you need delayed pushing aggregated objects onto the the logger needs a in that the that still needs to be a member of needs to reside on the heap in a smart to trigger the destruction have never wished for garbage collection when i do i sometimes feel a moment of bliss that i just do not need to but much more i miss all the cool toys that can be created through deterministic just does not cut have had one particularly complex structure that might have benefited from where smart pointers would cause circular references over multiple we muddled through by carefully balancing strong and weak but anytime we want to change we have to study a big relationship gc might have been but some of the components held resources that should be release note on the filehandle it was not intended to be just a sample but turned out thanks johannes schaub for pointing out and fredoverflow for turning it into a correct over settled with the approach

 wise i think there are a couple of ways you could improve your first is that your script is dependent upon the name of the script not while i think likely change the name of this you never know what mood be in a few years from instead why not just calculate the name of the script next problem is that i believe split function will fail if you ever place the directory in a path which contains a it will cause a path like to appear as much better to remove the split and just use the enumeration by the you are taking a dependency on the current path being the path containing the you should either make that an explicit parameter or use the path containing the file prefer the is the updated version i would gci in a security standpoint you have to consider the possibility that a malicious user adds a bad script into the target if they did so it would be executed with your file and could do damage to the but at the point the malicious user has access to your file likely they could do the damage without the help of your script so probably a minor

 working a site where users could technically stay logged in as long as they never close their browser therefore never get a new session what i could see a user leaves a browser open on computer the then use computer login and change their name which is stored in the they logout of but a is still logged in and still has their old name stored in the their name be updated till the next time they logout manually or they close their browser and open it again and are logged in through the remember me is a simple but in my case the subscription level of their account is stored in the session and can be do you deal with few ideas that i have a period of 10 minutes or the session data it might be exactly 10 minutes if the user is highly active as the function will get triggered right at the 10 minute point or it could be after 2 hours if the user leaves and comes back and then triggers the as little information as possible in the session and load the rest from the db on every page really like this database sessions and use the same session on all the i like but i could see it getting confusing when something like search criteria are stored in the same criteria would show up on both even such as the name or store it in the but for other information that would heavily affect their abilities on the store it in the session and load when needed to only do it once per there other better use database session and when an update is made load the other sessions change the relevant information and save them back to the is the best way to deal with sessions when the user may stay logged but a session key needs to be because of another

 would agree that json may be an excellent approach for passing but to go from php to you may want to use xml only because then you can use xml which may make parsing can then communicate back and forth via http connections or depending on which way data but i expect that it will flow from php so you could experiment with wcf to pass using a rest though php can do webservice client calls you communicate back from the with json or use a webservice response then you have a good decoupling between the two

 would just use the mac address to generate a request then require users to register with your your client will have a special application that takes that request key and produces an activation key which the user can then use for activating the once the software just works no occasionally phoning home for verification and if it were a real my first task would be to try and convince the client that this was a bad reason is that these schemes practically prevent your code from being they do however make the lives of your genuine customers i find it hard to think of any other industry that goes out of its way to annoy its genuine customers with schemes that never achieve their goals than government of course you do just do a token effort to meet the contractual obligation tell your client this taking the mac address a random number the computer have a network as the request key and using a program to just it with an ascii string to get the activation seems like a workable i would also store both keys since you want the software to if they just change their network card even they still see that as the same computer and will not be happy if the software stops going to be cracked regardless the program is rubbish which sure is not the this method will give your genuine customers an avenue for moving their software to another machine if your company becomes unresponsive somehow goes out of and so main trouble with schemes that rely on the uniqueness of a bit of hardware is that the customer may choose to change that bit of their disk contents to a larger hard disk makes hd serial numbers cpu serial numbers means upgrading to the latest intel bigmutha cpu kill your the mac address means they change their can all be fixed by using those values to create a key at install time and only check against that not the changed value six months down the it means you have to store the request and activation values but upgrades will not require your users to go through the process of their believe they will despise you for having to do

 would like to ask about your suggestions concerning unit testing against large want to write unit tests for an application which is mostly implemented in so mocking the database is not an database is quite large so restoring the database after a test run is also practically purpose is to manage the handling of applications for credit there are users in specific roles that change the state of objects and my job is to test part of this considering two agreements that meet specific conditions and then test changes of agreement state transition from waiting in some office to handled in this specific the agreements will be created in application itself and they will be my test all the tests will be in transactions that would be rolled back after performing these advantage of this approach is quite straightforward expected data could be easily described because i exactly know how the object should look like after the disadvantage is that the database cannot change in a way that will break the users and agreements used in test cases must always look the same and if there will be a need to change the database the preparation process will have to be agreements in unit programatically create agreements that would meet specific the data used for creating agreement will be chosen also the users that will change agreement state will be created advantage of this approach is ease of making changes to objects and ability to run tests on databases with different objects and have lots of fields and related data and afraid it would take some time to implement creation of these objects also afraid that these objects may contain some errors because the creation method will be quite hard to implement without do you think about these two any stack overflow readers think it is worth the effort create objects as described in second anyone here have any experience creating such testing against large

 would like to write a program that sets an environment variable in an instance of the shell it was called the idea is that i could store some state in this variable and then use it again on a subsequent know there are commands like but my understanding is that those only change the variable for the current process and modify the calling what i would like to be able to do is create a command that can bounce between two can go to a directory and but have a way of returning a 2nd time to the originally pushed can i change windows shell environment variables from	
 would look at some it would involve training the classifier to recognize particular words as indicating probability that a product belongs to one of your for after being it could recognize that if a product description has in a chance that a hard whereas if it has a chance a a word like probably would end up not contributing much to any which is the way you want it to downside to this would be that it typically requires fairly large corpora of training data before it starts to work but you can set it up so that it continues to modify its percentages while being in production you notice that it classified something and it will eventually become very techniques are used quite heavily recently for so it might be good to do some reading on ways been used	
 would look at to optimise your fedora boot if running one then you can certainly remove a lot of the services that fedora would normally come configured would also point out that perhaps for the amount of time going to spend optimising you may be better off investing in the appropriate hardware ssds and if boot time is governed by your optimising can be a major time

 would open the spreadsheet with the excel com if you add a reference to the microsoft excel object you can get to the com these using you can read from the spreadsheet by doing something like private void string workbook application excelobj excelobj new theworkbook sheets sheets worksheet worksheet range range string data as todo store the code would read the contents of the a1 cell into a of the quirks of working with the excel com interface is that you have to access data in a even if you just want one you can set the range to be a group of then you can iterate over the collection that it returns to get the contents of each would also want to add some error on the file name and tab is also a way to use odbc to read from but the spreadsheet has to be formatted in a certain there has to be a header data in row found it easier to use the com you have acquired the data you you could put it into a typed then you could bind that dataset to a datagridview if using winforms or a listbox in if you just want to save the data in an xml you could use the dataset writexml function to store the data to a

 would say one very compelling scenario to use mvc is if you have a group of experienced developers who have experience with from that situation myself little web i found it i was much more productive and comfortable using mvc over found it very hard to pickup webforms due to the aforementioned abstraction think proof of webforms complexity is i have never met anyone who i would consider a webforms knows the page lifecycle off by binding mvc actually allowed me to use my and software experience without needing to heavily invest in learning the webforms not only that but i got a much better understanding of and this i think would allow higher quality mvc allows you to factor code much better than so i think developers with lots of experience will be more comfortable in	
 would say that it depends on what it was but in general i am always in favor of having the fewest if you write it as a console service and use the task scheduler then you have two places to maintain going you write it as a windows service then you only have one fewer places to check in case something goes	
 would say that the standard approach here is to wrap the class you want to as a protected instance variable and then emulate all the members of the wrapped class in your container you can then mark this class and its appropiate members as virtual so that you can use standard polymorphism features with an example of what i is the class contained in the assembly whose code to which you have no virtual class wrapperclass protected closedclass public object new public void public void whatever assembly you are referencing were designed then all the that you might ever want to access would be marked appropiately but indeed this is unfortunately not the case you can even experienced this issue with the base class in my the wrapper class is the way to go it does have its benefits when the class from which you want to derive namely the modifier of methods you want the user of your class to have access the in the bcl is a pretty good example of

 would say the problem is that your base controller uses different data access basecontroller is hard wired to datacontext and that results in testability basecontroller needs to get data from why not to use repository in it as if ioc container is not you can inject repository dependency in inherited controllers and pass it to the way easy to create a mock for master page

 would strongly advise against using short just reading your example shows how much more documentation is suddenly when names like fatajtw are at some point it will get pretty much unmaintainable and this just for saving some bytes to the only reason for considering names is to make the resulting script smaller and thus save some i would instead recommend using gzip which will save you way more than a few bytes for an

 would suggest that you familiarize yourself with the history of i know that doing so has given me a much greater appreciation of what php is today and where it has come php was written by rasmus lerdorf to provide simple wrapper functions for the c code that was actually doing the so that he could have a simpler language syntax for writing templates that needed to behave the growth of php and the community which surrounds it is best described as and much like other things that grow its more than a little and downright you understand php and its you need to embrace php for everything that it is and everything that it is this idea was best presented by terry chay in his article without specifically talking about the concept of funky but he captures the concept of coding for php as if it were php and not favorite language better than anyone ever in other try to make php into etc because if you do fail and hate your a look at is php done the right must say that you must and always avoid the tendency of most beginning php developers to use the in other if you find that writing code that contains sql manipulation of validation of and html output all in a single php then doing it order to avoid it will be helpful to learn something about the nature of design this of course precludes a familiarity with but once learned the basics of programming in study the mvc design you have to implement this exactly but using the basic ideas of will allow you to avoid the blob script problem that most newbies tend to this i would strongly recommend that you take any code snippets you find on the web with a grain of and even if you find it in a book have to consider how old the book php as a language has advanced quite a long ways and you just take code samples at face value depending on their they may be using workarounds that were valid in or but simply are no longer necessary with newer great thing to do is to study the various frameworks out evaluate what you like and what you maybe even work up each of the quickstarts that are provided with the framework documentation so that you can start to get an idea of what you like and and i would strongly recommend that you review the code from the frameworks as well as several other projects so that you can get a feel for how others do things in take it all with a grain of salt because every php developer has their own pet peeves and nuances and none of us is right all the in most of the time with php there are going to be several pretty good ways to do you want to get a better understanding of the patterns that are being implemented by the frameworks and are commonly thrown around in the common vernacular on i would suggest that you read and teach all about the basic design patterns use in your development watch for the

 would validate the form on the client if the age is 0 then let the user know that not a valid on the server change the yield return new years is not a valid know that because you bind to a model property from your entity it gets 0 as the default value why you change that in the database set a default in the database to a value that you consider reasonable for the user so that it no longer displays as 0 for new you want to change the db use jquery to set the textbox values to empty strings on your create page when it if the user tries to submit such a form you can check on the client to disallow it and on the server you have to do the user will get a value is message the you can not compare it with 0 because someone insert a value 0 then it be considered as see a problem in this particular domain do you think that age of 0 is a good value or ask	
 would venture to say that there are many shades of gray between having an domain and cramming all of your services into your domain and quite at least in business domains and in my an object might actually be nothing more than just the for whenever the operations that can be performed on that particular object depend on multitude of other objects and some localized say an address for my review of the literature on the i have found a lot of vague ideas and but i was not unable to find a example of where the boundaries between methods and operations should how to implement that with current technology so for the purpose of this i will make up a small example to illustrate my the example of orders and an domain model would look something order long date long user which received the class orderitem long order to which this item long product bigdecimal bigdecimal my the point of the design is to use classes to better model the relationships between an model would look something order long date user orderitem order product bigdecimal bigdecimal you would be using an orm solution to do the mapping in this you would be able to write a method such as that would sum up all the for each order the model would be in a sense that operations that make sense from a business like would be placed in an domain at least in my design does not mean that the should know about your persistence that should be done in a separate and independent persistence operations are not part of the business they are the part of the even in this simple there are many pitfalls to should the entire be loaded with each if there is a huge number of order and you need a summary report for a huge number of would you be using loading objects in memory and invoking on each or is an sql query a much better from every that is why a decent orm solution like offers mechanisms for solving precisely these kind of practical with proxies for the former and hql for the what good would be a theoretically sound model if report generation takes the entire issue is quite much more that able to write or consider in one and not speaking from a position of but everyday practice in deploying business get something out of this feel free to provide some additional details and examples of what dealing regarding the and the example of sending an email after the total has been i would make a distinction fact that an email should be sent after price part of an order should be could also email actual method of sending an one has to is sending of an email an inherent ability of an or yet another thing that can be done with like persisting serialization to different formats i would and what i consider a good oop approach is the define an interface encapsulating operations of preparing and sending an interface emailsender public void public void recipienttype public void public void inside define an operation by which an order how to send itself as an using an email order public void total you should have a facade towards your application a point where the actual response to user action in my this is where you should obtain spring the actual implementations of this for be the spring mvc class orderemailcontroller extends baseformcontroller injected by private ordermanager private emailsender actual sending of modelandview httpservletresponse string id order order return new what you get with this objects contain they objects are decoupled from actual service implementation sending in separate thread by the nature of the interface interfaces are but know about any actual domain for if order gets an extra you need change only the can mock services and test domain objects can test actual services implementations know if this is by standards of certain but it a approach that works reasonably well in	
 would want to create a base and keep the template packet class that you call this base class your packet class would derive from the new packetbase that is to say each type that is generated at compile will derive from t can either be of type float or or packet public other members you need you need the type member that you had would return a here packetbase is just used as a generic name that holds any the queue would store a collection of method that client calls to obtain the return return current packet in figure out which type of packet you have you can use rtti with the have a have a for each type you can also beef up your packetbase with some virtual then you can call those directly instead of the rtti

 wpf it was possible to organise the xaml for multiple user controls by keeping the markup in separate xaml files in the themes folder and then using mergeddictionaries to import them into the availability of the silverlight 3 beta introducing merged dictionary it seemed like it might be possible to do the same with silverlight user but despite trying all combinations of build action on the merged dictionary files and the corresponding syntax for the source reference in i seem to get it anyone else does anyone know if it is possible and if so what i am doing so after numerous test getting working samples in wpf and moving the xaml and code over to silverlight 3 and it still i did a full uninstall and reinstall of all the silverlight 2 bits and all the silverlight 3 beta bits and finally got things can only assume that i somehow ended up with a faulty install of the beta i know but it seemed like i was still running in the silverlight 2 runtime despite apparently having the version 3 runtime jared for taking a look at things and checking with the sl3 thanks to and for producing the instructions and batch files for running silverlight 2 3 on the same mergeddictionaries in in silverlight	
 wpf you could do it by putting something the following on your silverlight 2 does not support binding to other controls using other there is no better way at this point in code is all

 writing a game development ide that creates and compiles projects been working on for the past few and am in the process of updating it to generate output not only for but also for thrillingly simple process for but still requiring some part of i have found it necessary to start generating an file as part of this to map dependent dll names to linux dependency names with confused about responsible for copying the file to the output name in a visual studio the build action for seems to normally be set to and its settings indicate that it be copied yet when visual studio compiles the project it generates sometimes found this to be when i use msbuild to build a solution file generated by the ide debugging msbuild copies to but when i compile the project with it like the config file being included as source code error a namespace does not directly contain members such as fields or and of course it copy it to the output when i include it as an is it my responsibility to simply copy to or is there a more standard way of doing it hardwired to take the first in my ide conceivable that the file would be renamed or another one added as in visual it seems odd to me that the ide has this secret action for config files think monodevelop behaves similarly in this regard because i find a special action for config files there i know how it even picks to what files this secret action copies to	
 writing a game that involves clicking links on various sites on the i know it sounds strange but the basic premise is that you start on my page where you click a link to some page on another you continue to follow links until you get to the page you are trying to think the difference being that i have control over the actual pages with the i need to be able to do is track all the links that they and when they get to the final i want to send them back to my site something along those i was thinking was that perhaps i could somehow intercept the page requests and inject some javascript to track which links they is this has anyone done anything like obviously this could pose a security do i have any other i want to avoid making the user collect a list of all the links and then post them into a textbox on my javascript into a

 written a helper class that takes a string in the constructor and provides a lot of get properties to return various aspects of the currently the only way to set the line is through the constructor and once it is set it cannot be since this class only has one internal variable i was wondering if i should keep it this way or should i allow the string to be set as example code my help why stream new line responses line new if is a quick example of counting the number of valid responses in a given scanned would it be more advantageous to code it like this stream new line new responses if code is used in the back end of a web application and needs to be somewhat i am aware that this may be a case of premature optimization but coding this for responsiveness on the client side and i decided to include the constructor of the class as well this is what it really class private string public the date the exam was public datetime datetime test out return a value indicating whether to use raw public bool useraw get return true the raw points per public float float test out return 2 i included some sample properties of the class to help as you can the class takes a fixed string from a scanner and simply makes it easier to break apart the line into more useful the file is a line delimiated file from a scantron machine and the only way to parse it is a bunch of calls and new instance or just set internal	
 written a library to match strings against a set of patterns and i can now easily embed lexical scanners into c know there are many well established tools available to create lexical scanners and to just name the first two that come to question is not about about the best approach to c the lexer example is just a concrete case of a general can see two possible a that converts a source file with the embedded lexer to a plain c file to a set of other files to be used in the a set of c to represent lexers in a more readable already done both but the question one would you consider a better practice according the following the lexer logic should be clear and easy to finding and fixing a bug should not be a in the build the preprocessor will require an additional step in the build the preprocessor will have to be in the path etc other if you had to maintain or write a piece of software that is using one of the two wich one will disappoint you an here is a lexer for the following all numbers be in decimal form including exponential like strings and single lists to lisp 4 on encountering the word end is or at the end of the the two scanner style 1 switch the preprocessor will handle this case skip strings case sum numbers sum case skip lists case stop processing t case skip a char and proceed scanner style 2 there can be up to 128 tokens per scanner with id x80 to xff is a pretty complex macro skip strings sum numbers sum skip lists stop processing skip a char and proceed anyone be interested in the current the code is macros or

 wrote one mainly as an attempt to make more when you do the method is explained it is based on but rather than take a large number of small you take a small number of large can tell for that instruction a function is costing you some percent x of total execution more or since it appears on the stack on of about because is a key the call stack exists as long as the program is if a particular call instruction is on the stack of the then if that instruction could that of time would does not depend on how many times is or how long the function call so timers and counters are missing the and in a sense all instructions are call even if they only call sampler is based on the premise that it is better to know the address of instruction with precision that is what you are looking than to know the number with if you know that you could save roughly of time by recoding do you really care that you might be off by still going to want to fix the amount of time it actually saves be made any less or greater by your knowing x it is possible to drive samples off of a but frankly i found it just as useful to trigger an interrupt by the user pressing both shift keys as the same since 20 samples is generally and this way you can be sure to take samples at a relevant time not while waiting for user it was quite another way would be to only do the samples while the user holds down both shift keys something like did not concern me that the taking of samples might slow down the because the goal was not to measure but to locate the most costly after fixing the overall speedup is easy to main thing that the profiler provided was a ui so you could examine the results what comes out of the sampling phase is a collection of call stack where each sample is a list of addresses of where every instruction but the last is a call the ui was mainly what is called a has a current which is a particular to the left is displayed the call instructions immediately above that as culled from the stack if the focus instruction is a call then the instructions below it appear to the as culled from the on the focus instruction is displayed a which is the percent of stacks containing that similarly for each instruction on the left or the percent is broken down by the frequency of each such of the instruction was represented by line and the name of the function it was the user could easily explore the data by clicking any of the instructions to make it the new variation on this ui treated the butterfly as consisting of alternating layers of function call instructions and the functions containing that can give a little more clarity of time spent in each not so worth mentioning some properties of this is not an because if an instruction appears more than once on any given stack that still counts as only one sample containing it still remains true that the estimated time that would be saved by its removal is the

 xslt is for string with xslt things get better since more string functions are and operations are xslt is still the most portable version to write code string processing can only be achieved through for the fun of flip string vertical string to be i do not endorse of the above code sample in any presentational issues should by all means be solved in the presentation the above will but recursion is among the most inefficient ways to do string and unless you have no other avoid string processing in

 you can play signed urls in flash no reading around i have managed to answer a couple of my own questions yes not a good idea to sign urls from within flash as the secret key would need to be in the swf or loaded from php so could be a security risk it is probably best to call a php method on the server to generate a signed url and return the file to flash return the path to the file but this does seem like an extra step that could be bypassed still not sure about this but i think that the signing process involves using the path to the file so each signature for each url is unique is this have further advice on

 you give some background as to what you are rarely any reason for explicitly using on variables other than to clean up a namespace of things you want to not sure why you are calling or running is fine a different use of objects when the exact time they get finalised matter strings like you may as well let the variable drop out of scope when your function it will be and it cause any harm till manually calling for such variables just clutters up your objects which need to be finalised immediately an open or a held you be relying on the garbage collector anyway it is not guaranteed to immediately collect such it happens to do so in the standard c python but not in jython or and is so not you should explicitly clean up such objects by calling or using the new only other reason might be that you have a very large amount of memory and want to signal you are done with it before the variable that refers to it goes out of scope example seem to fit either of these circumstances so not sure why manually invoking the garbage collector at

 you need the features of the series of if you need if your service cannot be completely described as as defined by the http if you like having to author xml for every interaction with the and parse it then you need use been some question about the value of a my imagination fails me when it comes to imagining how anyone could fail to understand on i have to think that anyone who has ever used a service much more complicated than would know why it is valuable to have someone else write the code that accepts creates the xml to send to the sends receives the then turns that back into i suppose this might not be necessary when using a restful at least not with a restful service that does not process complex even with a relatively simple service like used as an example of calling a restful one benefits from understanding the structure of the returned even the above service provides an xml schema it unfortunately describe the entire given that schema one still has to manually process the or else use a tool to produce serializable classes from the of this happens for you when the service is described in a and you use a tool like service in visual or the or you want start with the and go on to any other services with more complicated another thing that requires is description of the messaging patterns and protocols supported by the perhaps not required when the only choices are http verbs over http or life gets more complicated if using and

 you relax your requirement to close the you can still use open session in view and just commit everything in your service the session will still be available to lazy fetch but all your transactions will be but if going to switch to a web then you would need to eager load all of your entities dtos just force you to consciously eager load and prevent accidental bottom if you can skip the dtos in both but i would probably stick with open session in view and worry about web services when they actually become a

 you say probably cut wondering which xslt approach you have in approach would be to somehow transform the instance data for the not sure how that would work in and maybe why you said xslt approach would be to use xslt to produce a schema tailored for the current state of the form then use this schema to build the for the transformed schema would exclude definitions for fields that ready for display this sounds quite feasible to me that volunteering to the i know well enough to say if its caching would be suitable for your have thought that you want for reasons that get try to clarify what i what i was hearing in your description is that the current state of the record may affect the structure of the for the legal values for field a may be constrained by the values of fields and some of which may actually be unknown and unknowable at a given this ambiguity might make it difficult to present the form using a unified thought was that perhaps you have to limit yourself to an immutable if the current state of the data would be better represented by a modified schema one that reflects the allowed enumeration values for field or the union choice that is currently allowed for field then i proposed that perhaps transforming the schema before creating the form might do the to your comment about be concerned that caching might result in stale form definitions being served up when newer ones are due to changes to the data and the perhaps you could avoid this by permuting the namespace url based on the current state of the customized hope this

 you use a language with garbage collection you wont get access to the memory rather you are given access to some abstraction on top of that one of the things that is properly abstracted away is the the actual location in memory of the data as well as pointers to other when the garbage collector runs happens it will check if you still hold a reference to each of the memory blocks it has allocated for if you it will free that main difference between the different types of garbage collectors is their efficiency as well as any limitations on what kind of allocation schemes they can simplest is properly reference when ever you create a reference to an object an internal counter on that object is when you chance the reference or it is no longer in the counter on the target object is when this counter reaches the object is no longer referred at all and can be problem with reference counting garbage collectors is that they cannot deal with circular if object a has a reference to object b and that in turn has some or reference to object they can never be even if none of the objects in the chain are refereed outside the chain therefore accessible to the program at mark and sweep algorithm on the other hand handle the mark and sweep algorithm works by periodically stopping the execution of the mark each item the program has allocated as the program then runs through all the variables the program has and marks what they point to as if either of these allocations contain references to other data in the that data is then likewise marked as is the mark part of the at this point the program can no matter how is marked as reachable and everything the program reach is marked as the garbage collector can now safely reclaim the memory associated with the objects marked as problem with the mark and sweep algorithm is that it that efficient the entire program has to be stopped to run and a lot of the object references going to improve on the mark and sweep algorithm can be extended with so called garbage in this mode objects that have been in the system for some number of garbage collections are promoted to the old which is not checked that improves efficiency because objects tend to die young of a string being changed inside a resulting in perhaps a lifetime of a few hundred or live very long objects used to represent the main window of an or the database connection of a more detailed information can be found on based on the mark and sweep algorithm well as any other garbage collection algorithm except reference the garbage collection do run in the context of your since it has to be able to access stuff that your program is not capable of accessing therefore it is not correct to say that the garbage collector runs on the

 you want to both trap invalid use of the library to access the objects when they have been as well as have a api and in the then you could consider have a different api for debug and nondebug suppose for simplicity that you have only one class of objects you call this class the pointer type which you return from the api for accessing the internal objects is then defined objectptrfacade objectptr object the facade is class which you it works roughly like objectptrfacade copy constructor and assignment here object operator const return object operator const return object return this whenever you build a debugging you have a special kind of smart pointer in use which asserts before accessing the object that its is higher than that the object still if the object has been you get a failing which is better than a null pointer general of course it is so that using does not help if you have users of the because they could call and then still make a reference after the returns a which is	
 you want to break the usercontrol out of the something you can do to play around with the element placement in the z plane is to use a grid as the outermost container not doing so and use this as a guide to laying out your since items inside of a grid can occupy the same space and are based on the order in which you might be able to get the functionality looking sure if this fits what trying to but worth a items within a container are going to be clipped at the boundaries of their parent so to accomplish what looking for i would think the usercontrol would have to be a sibling of the stackpanel instead of being a child of

 your example you suggested one service for articles and one service for that may of course be just an but in that case it would not make sense to separate because it would be quite likely and common to have queries routines which make use of both category data and article that in it usually makes the most sense to group routines by the degree to which they are related to one if you can separate all your possible routines three clean groups with little to no then it makes sense to have three if you cannot cleanly separate any of your you should limit yourself to one web regarding your statement being a downside of one web service that necessarily you can always create layers of abstraction the web so that the service class itself is simply a facade with many thin method calls that reach into bulkier logic the the only approach which truly matters because the only approach which works is the simplest approach build what you need to build in as few layers as you only add complexity when you reach a problem which cannot be solved in a better than by adding that it is always easier to add complexity than to take it

 your producer you are likely to have some kind of main this is probably the best place to interrupt your instead of using and i suggest you use the java synchronization objects introduced in java could potentially do something like indexer lock lock new public void perform one indexing public item perform your need to make sure that each time the indexer releases the your index is in a legal in this when the indexer releases the it leaves a chance for a new or waiting operation to take the complete and release the at which point your indexer can proceed to its next if no is currently then your indexer just reaquires the lock itself and goes on with its next you think you might have more that one thread trying to do the lookup at the same you might want to have a look at the readwritelock interface and reentrantreadwritelock course this solution is the simple way to do it will block either one of the threads that have the you may want to check if you can just synchronize on your data structure but that might prove tricky since building indexes tends to use some sort of balanced tree or or whatnot where node insertion is far from being suggest you first try that simple then see if the way it behaves suits if it you may either try breaking up the the indexing steps into smaller or try synchronizing on only parts of your data worry too much about the performance of in java uncontended locking only one thread is trying to take the is as long as most of your locking is locking performance is nothing to be concerned

 your strings are very either get your compiler to do it or manually unroll your loop and drop in a memory prefetch instruction or two every way while the cpu is the memory controller can be pulling in the next lines of you save the length of the string when you create it you can skip all the checks for the nul which means you can unroll your loop to operate in bigger chunks and reduce the number of compare and branch although with current branch it honestly make much with great cpu branch the loop will slow down if it has to check the loop counter every time through the loop to decide when to do a memory prefetch so unrolling is still helpful in that best performance the cpu does need to get the branches hinted and where profiling feedback comes in very otherwise the compiler is just making a somewhat educated

 your usercontrol appears on every then one way to address this would be to use a base controller from which all of your controllers derive and generate the viewdata for the usercontrol by overriding the onactionexecuting method and putting the logic if your usercontrol is less but still frequently used throughout the you could extend actionfilterattribute and have your filter generate the needed this attribute could be used to decorate the controllers or actions that generate views that use the assuming in all of this that the data for the usercontrol is independent of the action being if there is a probably best to push the logic into a class perhaps using and make the generation of the data explicit in each action or controller overriding
