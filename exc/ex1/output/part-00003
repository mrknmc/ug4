 accessing attributes methods in lookups can usually be reduced to a static function even in the case of virtual which are the lookup is just reading an offset from a dynamic names are based on want to look up find in the local variable hash then find in hash in some dynamic like python and there may be additional calls to implement dynamically generated of these lookups are hard to make python has one of the most hash table implementations in the and javascript has had millions of dollars of research money poured into making it these tactics work compare javascript with ie 5 to see just how much but they are much more difficult than just statically generating function should mention that how a language is can python has several different ways to interact with variable which is nice in some but makes optimization very other dynamic such as common lisp and can compete evenly with static languages in many use cases because dynamic are more

 actually have is the constructor for an object whose prototype is the object keyword can be confusing to its value in a function depends on what object the function is called as a property you want to be able to call a method of an object from an event you should use a function closure like vincent robert suggest you check out these links for more information about var myint constructor sets a local variable within the function which is not accessible from outside of the if you want to initialize a property of the you need to use this value will only be set on objects constructed by and not on the myclass function object

 add a field to your users table to store the currently used session this id is easily accessible from your when the user logs store that every page check to verify that the current session id matches what was stored in your user if it then clear the current session data and kick the user back to the log in will not stop the user from using multiple tabs in ie 7 because ie7 uses the same instance for each but it will stop them from using multiple browser reason why this will work is that each browser contains own cookie are matched up server side based on a cookie value that stores the session id and is sent back to the server on each this is not a very effective means of eliminating session which it sounds like the security audit is trying to if you need to do update your question and go way to stop session hijacking is to store a random number in the session and as a cookie on the when the next request comes verify that the cookie and session values if they then reset the session id variable in your user this will force all sessions to log in for every page request create a new random the downside is that pages can not be but probably

 advantage of png is full alpha which allows you to have smooth edges and shadows in in web the main disadvantage is that it only supports lossless which for complex images means a very large file on the other hand offers great compressibility for complex but no seen flash elements with highly compressed images that also have smoothed edges and i know much about flash and have no idea how this is this is basically the effect i would like to be able to do a complex image with transparent shadowed questions does lossy compression with transparency work in there flash specific layering tricks being used are the shadows generated or rasterized into the image as i would do with a there any swfs or swf generating scripts that could replace a png image with a lossily compressed thinking progressive enhancement to improve loading speed of certain design if this would it be feasible to write there any formats that allow lossy compression with been hard for me to find specific info on djvu might be a should we be pushing browser makers to support another there other solutions to this everything in flash or accepting enormous file sizes are the current some other and canvas may be able to apply but supported by could cut up a png along scan lines and compress those with leaving the edges as this would be nasty in but it would work in all sounds like a fun write it by the could write a lossy image filter that can decrease color complexity along the png scan lines to improve compression within the png i just this had to but i find anyone know of for your image plus for the

 afraid given that a functional language the strictest it would be rather difficult to do so i the primary way to make good use of parallelism in is to use via the async module i the tpl parallel which is being introduced with is going to fulfil a similar role in notably it can be used in all languages equally though i say sure exactly how going to integrate with the existing async perhaps microsoft will simply advise the use of the tpl for or maybe they will leave both as an option and one will eventually become the de facto here are a few articles on asynchronous in to get you	
 afraid standard stuff of is not what you you can try to change authentication module so it you in with what roles does your visitor perhaps you will use some special table that corresponds user and custom principal with user roles enumerated and assign identity and principal to the current also think that making special roles for each site is good when you would have hundred you would also have two hundred pretty i we were solving similar we were just not using standard we had single set of roles used on all membership of concrete user is determined according to current site and his relations to this another possibility to investigate is application that exists in authentication maybe possible to isolate each subsite into separate method that works for our not make a lot of cloned use only users and if your sites are public then role could be just global user on one site differ from user on another if and are different then of course should also be bound to a standard membership but do not use standard role a mechanism for storing relation between site and it could be simple table that holds site user is and you have to override is isinrole to be cover it this method is in iprinciple so you have to make your own principal quite isinrole of this type should look take current site look into the table and get you have to associate your principal with a do it in postauthenticaterequest is also honestly not sure when is it but it also have isinrole we can override it in the same but other methods of this provider are for example it accepts array of user names and but to what context should it be to not because i know when this method is so it requires some i see that ropeprincipal by itself uses roleprovider to fetch list of so maybe implement only using standard for our application this is not a so i say what problems could be hidden

 after the call to returns it is safe to discard the data you passed to if you do that have a memory like in this int new pass the pointer to the buffer to the call but then the pointer is lost and most likely what you should do is store it and delete it aftet the call if the texture is of a constant you can pass a pointer to an array that is on the int if you want to worry about pointers and you can use

 agree you want to lock display modal in the gui when the concurrency i think can be really frustrating for a user when they know why it is think keeping the gui responsive if there was no and then when a conflict is when you receive the response from your other you correct the i like the effect to let the user know that their operation has been perhaps with status bar similar unobtrusive message to explain the reverted you can add some messaging when operations you could provide some additional feed back in an unobtrusive that there is a potential for conflict with another	
 ahead with use a lot of for the mark use a repeater control with all clean html mark up of server side controls which would generate a lot of unnecessary mark up quickly creating performance populate x number of items on initial and then using jquery pull data as required based on user you can serve this data via decode json on client side using jquery and perform a loop which converts this json into appropriate html and injects it into the correct html be simple

 ajax encompasses a client side framework it is perhaps best for its server side particularly the what you get with ajax is ajax for the basic without having to write a single line of on the other hand you to write some javascript or go a little working with ajax can soon become a little on the otherhand is lightweight and requires you to write although for most the jquery guys has done a very good job of hiding the ugly javascript stuff so apart from a small learning curve it comes pretty natural if you are on in css problem in using jquery with can be if you mess too much with the dom you might get validation

 all about hamming distance between two values is the number of bits at which they so if you transmit but i receive then the number of bits which must have been switched in transmission is the hamming distance between a and codes are useful when the bits in each code word are transmitted somehow we care whether serial or but they for instance combined into an analogue value representing several or after each bit is independently random with some fixed either received or assuming the transmission is fairly most bits are received so errors in a small number of bits are more and simultaneous errors in large numbers of bits are a hamming code usually aims to correct to detect errors the wikipedia article for details of the two main codes which bigger errors can be but afaik used as code works by evenly spacing out the code points in which in mathematical terms is the metric space consisting of all values of the relevant word with hamming distance as the imagine that each code point is surrounded by a little of invalid if a value is received that a code then an error must have because only valid code points are ever a value in the buffer zone is then the assumption that a error the value which was transmitted must be distance 1 from the value but because the code points are spread there is only one code point that so to that code on grounds that a error is more likely than the greater error that would be needed for any other code point to produce the value in probability the conditional probability that you sent the nearby code point is greater than the conditional probability that you send any other code given that i received the value i so i guess that you sent the nearby with a certain confidence based on the reliability of the transmission and the number of bits in each an invalid value is received which is equidistant from two code then i say that one is more likely to be the true value than the so i detect the but i correct errors are not corrected by a secded hamming the received value is further from the value you actually than it is to some other code and i erroneously it to the wrong so you either need transmission reliable enough that you care about or else you need error detection as well a crc over an entire

 all else being equal either way is which to usually depends on the overall architecture of the application or class library in which you find the if the data access code seems tangled with the object then it might make more sense to split it into two classes as if the crud methods are delegations to a dal with maybe then leaving them in the user class should be complexity is more or less the same in both a between a assembly with few classes or a assembly with a larger number of also assuming that the crud methods should be easiest to get the code written right now but consider possible refactorings in the future should you find that be better that

 all major desktop browsers support so do many mobile including opera and safari on the the only major browser i know of that support iframes is the blackberry object tag is supported by most but the implementation is extremely inconsistent across the various wrong with just having a flat page with an ordinary navigation if you are only displaying one page at a and the only interface element being placed outside of the iframe is a tab then why not just integrate the tabs into the page layout and do away with the of any sort tend to break the familiar browser behaviors that people are the forward and back navigation and they completely disable the use of when building a you should try not to restrict or dictate to visitors how allowed to browse your if the user wants to open a link a new they should not be left without a navigation if they make their browser window a particular the page content should fill that not a predetermined area specified by the dimensions of the are inherently makes them which is why so few professional websites use cheap broadband is widespread enough these days that reloading a few extra kilobytes of navigational data makes no difference to the overall user

 alleviate your doubt in the original is indeed a reference the thing to remember is that what you are doing to the array and what you are doing to the string are not the new string to new array the array you are are changing the data in piece of memory for the string you are creating a new string at a new memory and making point to that newly allocated is a different remains pointing at the original memory location where the characters are an aside because of the of string there is no way a change to will show up in any attempt to change the string as will create a new string in that

 also going to assume that is supposed to subtract a number from all items in the reason not getting any result for z is because building the list on the way into the which means that when the stopping predicate prolog works way back out of the recursion and z becomes uninstantiated is z is z is z is z is z is is going into the recursion first and building your list on the way maybe like subtracted is head changed is the order of the rules in the recursive predicate and the terms of the stopping now it recurses until it reaches an empty at which point it instantiates the result variable with an empty list as then it bubbles back up adding values to the list as it does this

 always had doubts when it comes to designing proper report of you have the following to be i will use suppose you want to give a report of the various if something goes wrong not really just informative behavior of the easy solution is to put print doing print am starting to do step print did step print am starting to do step print did step print am starting to do step print did step this is quite suppose that this code is going to end up in a i would not expect my library to print stuff i would expect it to do the job sometimes i would like to provide not only in debug but also to keep the user informed that something is actually in the process of being print is also bad because you have control of the handling of your it just goes to and nothing you can do about except solution is to have a module for doing am starting to do step did step am starting to do step did step am starting to do step did step has the advantage that you sort of know a unique place for your logging and you can tinker this service as much as you you can silence redirect it onto a to or even to a disadvantage is that you get a very strong coupling with the logging basically every part of your code depends on and you have calls to logging third option is to have a report object with a clear and you pass it doing am starting to do step did step am starting to do step did step am starting to do step did step you can also pass the reporter object to if they have more to it reduces coupling with a but it introduces coupling with the instantiation of the nullreporter this can be solved by using none as default and checking before calling which is because in python you have to write a conditional every time c you could define a if reporter is not doing option is to work and have an signal as your code it emits information with proper status and anyone interested can subscribe to the signals and provide nice and very but requires a little of as i think this can quickly be done with the python battery you can raise exceptions with a meaningful error but this of course can be used only if you are exiting from an error it does not work for occasional like to clarify the fact that the situation is more and not limited just to a sequence of invoked it could also involve control if print to print list of files from remote report could also be into the actual so you would have a in the and routines as a first question therefore do you think is the best design for some code in the case of a to be at the same time silent when noise could be disruptive for the but verbose when to handle a balanced intermix between logic code and reporting code between code and error checking has been solved with what could be done to partition the of reporting from the code logic more thoughts for the think not only a matter of decoupling the logging code from the logic i think also a matter of decoupling the information production from the information similar techniques already in particular to handle ui but i really see the same patterns applied to the logging i accepted the answer from marcelo because he points out at the factual evidence that a compromise is the best solution in this and no silver all the others were interesting answers as and i was really pleased to upvote all of thanks for the information during code best

 am currently stuck at a dead end with the following have a collection with each containing an and a property called array contains the and of that subcagtegory i feel like creating another have a with bound properly to categories and i also have check boxes next to the tree node and i bind to a of the id of the and the an overall list of that should be converter i use simply checks if the name of the i provide is part of the list are values binding this works fine and overall i am quite happy with the problem comes with converting the when user changes the value i must either add the id of the to the list of all categories or remove that id from unfortunately when attempted to implement the method for i only have access to the actual value that changed true or false value of and have no access to the id of the that that specific checkbox is bound tried but failed the name when i do the initial conversion is not an option since using the same converter for all the and thus only save the last tried to a event is useless because whatever they fail to be triggered am contemplating to ignore the and use events instead but feel like that is a rather solution because i might just as well ignore the bindings is this the only way to ran out of options but still hope for a if out binding

 am designing this hr system for a the thing is i have all the tables designed and was planning on using the in vs2008 to generate the entity classes is the first time i work with in this is my first i wanted to make the app with 3 layers of the programmers of the company suggested not 3 but 4 or 5 but after reading quite a lot of blog entries and a lot of questions here realized that is not quite easy to do that with linq to sql because of how the datacontext works and how difficult it is to pass objects between layers using linq to just use the entity classes generated by the vs2008 orm and add any validation and bussines logic in partial that would be 2 or the app will be used by like 10 so i think the 2 layer approach is a big issue for the a will be developed so candidates can apply to jobs i want to develop it as scalable as but the truth is i have a lot of time to waste to make a times running up said all should i just use the entities generated by the vs2008 any suggestion or idea would be greatly to sql orm

 am everyone it a bit confused about exactly what the goal is so give three possible answers that may cover what you actually the relatively simple goal of getting the script to read from either a list of files on the command or from its regular 0 exec from this point the stdin is redirected from the supplied on the command the use of is the best way to avoid problems with funny characters in filenames and unquoted both mess this the trick using here is a it fires off cat in the background to feed data from files supplied on the command and then we use exec to replace the stdin with the output from that seem to be what you actually what you seem to really want is to pass the supplied filenames or the stdin to a command inside the this requires sort of the opposite converting the stdin into a file a named whose name can be passed to the like 0 command goes command goes uses to launder the stdin through cat to a named which is then passed to command as an stdin is taken from the i think what you want to but not quite what asked which is to redirect the stdin from the supplied files pass stdin to the command inside the this can be done by combining the above 0 exec goes i think why actually want to do

 am of the view that applications are so different from each other and our understanding of how applications should be written is sill very past windows forms applications i have worked on have been so different from each some of the design differences i have seen are most talk to database a backend that has been written for the given application a set of web services that were written for use by many applications and be changed for your being done by being done with the commands to backend of usages of no usages of data data being that work well in standard grid controls need custom controls for most of the ui developer teams of 10 or 20 developers on the of unit test using mocks etc no unit tests i think possible to create one implementation of mvc that always fits best posts i have seen really mvc and a mvc system is built the way it is the your own series by jeremy d after working though it you should be able to understand your options a lot smart client guidance microsoft composite application should also be it is a bit complex but can work well for applications that have a good a implementation for a winforms give an overview that is worth a lot of people like i have never used but will look at it the next time i need a mvc is a software development approach that combines the ideas of the model view presenter design pattern and it lets you start of by writing tests in the language i click the button the file should be saved and unsaved file warning have no experience using but will give it a try when i get a as it looks very stackoverflow questions you may may wish to look at and you are thinking of useing at any point take a look at the viewmodel here is a very good video you should take a look dolinger on view view design pattern for give another option that may make it easer to convert to wpf if every is yet another mvvm sample for winforms that also includes auto binding based on property ask yourself you are using you wish to be able to unit test as much code as you trying to allow as much code as possible to be you trying to make your code base easy to other reasons that can be valid for a given you are clear on your it becomes easier to choose an implementation or

 am working on an application which accepts any uploaded csv stores it alongside other datasets which have been uploaded and then produces output or based on the user selecting which they want the database will be automatically expanded to handle columns and datatypes as this is in preference to a uploading these 2 sets to a blank dept age sales it dept age sales 24 it 32 programatically change the table so that importing dataset a results in 3 newly created columns importing dataset b results in 1 newly created column at the forget about whether the recordsets should be combined or not and that no issue i have is that some columns will also have lookup values say that the dept column will at some point in the future have associated values which give the address and phone numbers of that the same could be true for the salary looking up tax groupings number of columns in this big table should not become too high few but will be high enough to want the user to administer the lookup table structure and values through an admin panel rather than have to involve developers each is whether to use individual lookup tables for each column or a combined lookup table which references the column normally i would opt for individual lookup but here the application will need to create them automatically and then add a new join into the master sql this would be done at the request of the user rather than when the added avoid hundreds of empty combined lookup table on the other hand would need to be joined multiple times onto the data selecting on the column name each lookups seems to make sense to me but i may be barking up completely the wrong creation of new lookup tables based on values in main data

 answer describes how i eventually solved my note that while the answer by john dibling was this was not the final solution to my this is because the message is sent as the final message to the but this can be handled before the last message to the window has finished being see for example for an explanation of the is called with calls your your you call ends up calling dialogproc again with calls your call in your having called the object is no longer but you are still technically in the handler so you will probably crash when you eventually get back this means it is not really safe to assume that you can do in since the object may still be live in some other stack a window designed to allow any window to use the method from the atl cwindow you must call subclasswindow for this instance so that the window procedure finalmessagewindow public t the object wanting to receive the final message the t the object that wants to get the onfinalmessage called when the final window message for the window has been processed this is often a good time to delete the hwnd the window virtual void created the above note that it is derived from the atl cwindow class this allows me to use the onfinalmessage handler for this the onfinalmessage handler is different from the postncdestroy in mfc windows in that it is guaranteed to be called only after the final message handler on the stack has then use window subclassing to insert this window as the window procedure for my own roughly we implement the onfinalmessage handler for our delete	
 answer is correct but the key point is buried deep enough that bring it out as a separate your types in this specific case the compiler accepted an array of integer but only because that has a special meaning and what you any other attempt to define a type in the definition would simply have if you want two things to be assignment compatible you have to declare them as being the not merely two types that are built the a array of b array of a array4 array of a b a the compiler does what you would	
 answer is developers will need to frig with system configurations to test install software nothing to test the installation process of whatever they happen to be poke about the registry and run software that will not work properly without admin privileges to list a few there are a host of other tasks integral to development work that require administration privileges to in mind that development staff do not necessarily have root access to production admin rights on a local pc does not significantly compromise security of production there is almost no legitimate operational reason for restricting admin access to local pcs for staff that need it to do their the most important reason to provide administrative access is that setting up a compromised or second rate development environment sends a message to your development value your work so little that we are prepared to compromise your ability to do your for no good in we quite happy to do this to cover our pander to the whims petty bureaucracy because we simply be just the best the case is that really the type of control freaks that view it our perogative to tell you how do your job and what you do or need to do make do with given and be that got a job at providing a alone fundamentally work environment for development staff is a recipe for the natural consequences of pissing off your staff inability to retain competent high staff poor morale and poor quality going out of your way to do so particularly if an overtone of pandering to bureaucratic whim is just in mind that your staff turnover just incur costs of replacing the the most serious cost of staff turnover is that most of the ones that stick around will be the deadwood that get a better over time this degrades the capabilities of the departments if your industry is sufficiently close you can also find yourself getting a point to note is that administrative privileges are far less of an issue for development on or mainframe systems than it is on on these platforms a user can do far more in their own domain without needing you will probably still want root or sudo access for but not having this will get underfoot much less this flexibility is a significant but lesser known reason for the continuing popularity of operating systems in computer science

 answer the exact there but pretty and it will purely be a you need runtime use a and based on your updated you may have misunderstood how they you need something you can use to represent the of a at compile in everything apart from integers has to be represented by so use a type to represent a a member of type integer that stores a and another for storing their last age typedef int typedef you need something like a that does lookup at compile called it give it support for up to 8 firstly we need a placeholder to represent the absence of a none struct we can the shape of class t0 class t1 class t2 class t3 class t4 class t5 class t6 class t7 then specialise this for the case where there are no void int reason for this will be come clear in a the definition for all other class class class class class class class class struct ctmap public typedef using typename typename t0 return the going on if you will build a type for by recursively expanding the because from and we provide storage for the first field and then discard it when we this all comes to a sudden stop when there are no more because the specialization for kicks we can like looking up in a but at compile using a class as the means we can also do a function that prints one where the member to be printed is a type so we can call it like you can write a thing that is a little like a a little like a	
 answer to this question is one of process and toolchain need to decide how you wish to access known versions on how you want to make changes to those and how you want to disseminate changes to other vcs systems that are will support common here is one that is is on the time for a tag the a branch off of the trunk at the tag you the code based on the development of new features on the you need to fix a bug in check out the branch and fix release that as creating a new tag changes from your branch back to the trunk as steps 6 7 as needed until your next is another common is on the time for a tag the to production based on the a bug is create a branch to fix that bug against the on the new and that branch back to steps 6 whenever you find a are very common and simple to they are easily supported by most version control if you get more complex you will reduce the toolset but possibly have more

 answer your general question i would say the best way to handle database connections in java is to avoid the its ok for testing or learning about jdbc but not for real production if you have a data source that does not have its own jdbc driver but it has an odbc driver then you may not have a main reason why i suggest that you stay away from it though is that it makes it difficult to deploy your you have to set up the data source on the machine that you are running your application if you have access to the machine no but suppose you are sending the application off to the the pure java jdbc driver works better for this because it is included as part of your application so once your application is installed it is ready to connect to the data course depending on your requirements there are two other types of drivers but thats another

 applications can be written identically to desktop roughly as windows console apps and browser apps most mobile platforms support a but the mobile versions of most tools are more and usually communications which often makes development more challenging trying to keep various kinds of state and you usually have to be more sensitive to subtleties in the ui really no particular dichotomy between mobile apps and web the concepts particularly

 appreciate some opinions on a concern i have a table in my with the basic stuff like application requires that i track a vast number of attributes for each so much that i will likely run out of columns storage tempted to add a userproperties table with propertykey and propertyvalue this approach fits well with the concern is that if each user has say 100 when the database has a million users in have property would think that with a clustered index on the that access will still be screaming and you are really storing about the same amount of data as you would with the ideas or thoughts on performance ideas for a better db thanks so much for all the great have been toying around with the and one thing keeps bothering i need to query on some of these attributes pretty and worse these queries could involve finding all users who match criteria on as many as 10 of these attributes at the same a i am now leaning towards the but possibly splitting the data off into one separate forming a relationship keyed on the using and while i think tables with this many columns are i think considering all the challenges and it is probably the right but i am still eager to hear other design	
 approach does mean defining a unique set of values for each but this is for the other	
 approach is to add a method to your class and just let the method of arraylist do all the string return make registration get one car per line in the but it is quick and easy if you just want to see what is in the cars would be something like	
 approach is to memoize dynamic call this always before calling this wrapper calls but the solution using and if the solution has been this is for case your prolog supports then it gets even table execution with version of march word cpu time	
 approach notably in programming in the unix and network is to wrap calls with error checking code and then use the wrappers in the example for result error checking in full in calling way you get to show error handling while allowing the flow of calling code to be clear and	
 approach used successfully in the past uses a manual reset event and asynchronous invocations to detect when the user has stopped the code looks something like use manual reset event to q up waiting each new text changed event clears the only the last changed will hit the triggering the manualresetevent tbdelay void textchangedeventargs sendorpostcallback actiontorunwhenuserstopstyping o open the resetevent to discard these let all pending through the close the callback check how we via timeout or bool timedout if	
 approach would be if there is actually a problem with performance it alreade acceptable to my the performance at each teir long does it take the database to come up with how long does it take the service to respond with how much time does it take from the service to the on the measurements i would then determine where to do my remember the closer to your data storage you do the easier it but the closer to the client you do the better the performance gain remember that caching should not be the first thing to do to improve you should also look into other performance gains as are the stored procedures is there a lot of overhead in the wcf is there some inefficient processing in the do i realy need all that data in one	
 approach you be sure to do some thorough testing if there is any chance that your web application relies files or dirs having certain while allowing too permissive permissions is probably bad this does happen so you might break the the	
 approach you could take would be to use json as a protocol between parent and child since json support is readily available in many and is fairly you could also use a pipe to send an arbitrary amount of data down to the child assuming your requirements allow you to have the child scripts read from standard for the parent could do something like here is a sketch of a child imagine this were written in a different this trivial the output

 apps usually do two things on an the first is to write it to a local log file if it uses some type of database logging as then it sends an of the error to a distribution list set up for if the database log write the error is still in the local log file and also sent via the the error is still logged so you can troubleshoot the problem more fault tolerant than that would only be worth the effort for extremely mission critical

 are a couple of ways this can be code running at does not need to be written in the same language as the it merely has to be able to be linked together with os virtually all languages can interoperate with which is really all there is technically no java functions can call c and c functions can call java and if the os written in c for the sake of argument that written in then the os code can call into some intermediate c which forwards to your and vice c is pretty much a of a program has been compiled native its source language is no longer assembler looks much the same regardless of which language the source code was written in before as long as you use the same calling convention as the no bigger problem is runtime not a lot of software services are available in the there usually is no java virtual for is no reason why there technically but but safe to assume that not in its as java a java program a lot of it needs the java vm to interpret and jit the and it needs the class library and so there are two ways around java in the this would be an unusual but it could be compile your java source code to a native a java program have to be compiled to java you could compile it to x86 the same goes for whatever class libraries you those too could be compiled all the way to of parts of the java class library requires certain os features that be but then use of those classes could be it can be but not and unclear what course another problem may be that java let you access arbitrary memory which would make a lot of hardware communication pretty but that could be worked around perhaps by calling into very simple c functions which simply return the relevant memory areas as arrays for java to work

 are a of issues at play terms of pure performance and things like indexes are set up databases are very good at one query in sorting at the the database is probably in practice the database often becomes the bottleneck for an anything you can do to move work away from the database will improve your overall application that includes moving sort operations to a or presentation the presentation tier may not be able to sort one query as but it might be better positioned to handle that overall this is especially true when you can reliably push that work all the way to individual though that can be the other more to consider here than pure you also want to think about future more maintainable than a simple only one line of compared to who knows how much extra programmer work to get a sort working this might be a case where better off throwing some money at the problem to make sure your database is simply able to maintain an level of sorts and here the issue cut and a school of thought that believes sorting really should be considered a function of the presentation tier and that ultimately the presentation tier is also the more maintainable place to do this i subscribe to that but it is out	
 are a ton of really good suggestions but there is one minor thing i see that like to comment database are you as someone who spends a ton of time on mysql the thing that jumps out at me is the or mysql can be stupid with seen it be faster to do two selects and union them your row count is large the not that could be a agree with the other indexes should make it and often better to let the db do it rather than handle it the db knows what unless you have a really big data set and want to shift the sorting burden to the client the db can take more let the db do the sorting	
 are absolutely correct when you say that ui is time costly and error great compromise i have found is as realized that a lot of data not can be presented using a simple table as a rather than continuously try to create custom panels and fancy it seem obvious at but quite usable and visually is it so because i was able to create a reusable framework which can accept a collection of concrete models and with little to no effort can render all these models within the so much its adding a toolbar above the my framework can add remove from or edit entries in the using the full power of i can hide and sort as needed by extending various classes only this is find myself reusing a heck of a lot of code every time i want to display and manage new i make extensive use of icons rows or to beautify the i use large icons as a window header to make each screen different and appealing and it always looks like new and different but its always the same code behind lot of work and effort was required at first to do the but now its paying off big can write the gui for an entirely new application with as many as 30 to 50 different consisting of as many screens in a fraction of the time it would take me using the ui would recommend you evaluate and explore this

 are controls that are children of a naming control have their full ids built by appending ids of their parents using in case of a this is necessary to differentiate between multiple instances of the same child control why and not i guess because many people already tend to name their controls and the symbol is as good as the is the right id and why used as a name for controls such as when post back the framework needs to be able to match form keys with appropriate confusion with i comes from the fact that an id you are using inside and the id you see in html are two different the ids are just for whatever when a control gets rendered clientid all get replaced with my guess is that this was done to make it about that you really should try avoiding it whenever findcontrol is a recursive which breaks into and finds gridview2 and asks if it has the as a child the process repeats for each part separated by a side whenever you find yourself calling for some deeply buried you need to examine the pattern and ask for whatever needs to be done with the most likely needs to be done with a as in that it probably needs to be handled on onitemcreated or on where you have access to a row who about

 are different kinds of cloud computing with lots of different vendors providing it would make me nervous to code my apps to work with a single cloud that you specifically had to code and microsoft i believe you need to specifically code for that platform maybe google i recently jettisoned my own dedicated servers and moved to rackspaces mosso cloud platform have no proprietary coding and i am really pleased with it so cut my costs in and performance is way better than my sql server databases are now running on 64bit enterprise sql server versions with 32g of ram that would have cost me a fortune on my previous providers far as being out of luck when the cloud is that was true if my dedicated server went down it never but if there was a hardware crash on my dedicated i am not sure it would be back any quicker than rackspace could bring their cloud back	
 are different ways of creating dynamic strings in c length that constantly after some google the main way of doing this is to use way i implemented this is using linked lists with 32 bytes chunks for each was wondering if there are better ways of tackling this apart from using and linked and what the cons and pros for each method the reason i am doing this is because receiving dynamic data from a socket and was looking for a flexible way of storing without allocating huge amounts of data that dynamic string

 are many forms of leaks that allocates unmanaged leaks that allocates and uses unmanaged like lifetime of understanding of how gc and memory management in the first two is usually handled by two different pieces of idisposable on the object and disposing of the unmanaged in the dispose a to make sure unmanaged resources are deallocated when gc has found the object to be eligible for is you are using a big list holding thousands of totalling a significant size of if you keep around a reference to this list for longer than you need you will have what looks like a memory in if you keep adding to this so that it grows with more data and old data is never you definitely have a memory source of this seen frequently is to attach methods to event handlers but forget to unregister them when slowly bloating the event handler both in size and code to an incorrect understanding of how memory management works can mean that you look at the memory usage in a process viewer and notice that your app keeps growing in memory if you have lots and lots of memory gc might not run that giving you an incorrect picture of the current of as opposed to mapped only seen one resource management bug in so far and afaik it has been slated for fix in it was with copying the desktop screen into a in response to the question in the how to avoid keeping references longer than then the only way to do that is to to just me if you have a method it might be processing files on or downloading or and you used a reference to a big early in the before the and then you use that data structure for the rest of the then in not running under a is smart enough to know that this though it is held in a variable that is technically in is eligible for garbage the garbage collector is really aggressive in this in and running under a it will keep the reference for the life of the in case you want to inspect it when stopped at a if the reference is stored in a field reference in the class where the method is not so since impossible to determine whether it will be reused later or at least very very if this data structure becomes you should clear the reference holding to so that gc will pick it up

 are not at least they many developers talked to seem to find my view of web standards slightly but stay with me you try to create the standard before the you have several long delay before useful implementations nobody has a working implementation to and since nobody is using any of the features it exist there is little impetus to actually implement a type of potential for standards that cannot actually be who knows for sure until somebody actually tries the hla standard was a good example of this to the point where the dod had to write an memo that attempted to set the de facto standard by glossing over some of the errors in the actual potential for standards that serve any practical do people actually want see example at which has fallen into a i think of anybody met who found the css does not including box model to be inability for implementers of the standard to distinguish their products from their resulting in a stubborn desire to break with the standard in practical or see example at think that the w3c learned this the hard way in recent some of the most visible innovation has come from a new browser examples would be html5 canvas xmlhttprequest outlook web access input range rss and the video element came from the proprietary level on not from the standards tower on and these new were forged by looking at these past individual implementations copied microsoft largely for and so not by some think tank pondering the the netscape plugin and sql are all examples of where breaking changes are done gradually in a standard should be a least common denominator that smooths over the basic differences in a pidgin language that works across all of and not an enumeration of robert prescriptive rules about a language or because then you end up with rules that always make sense or apply a ideal trying to apply grammar rules to a like trying to apply grammar rules to an oh this is what the greatest defect in the css standard at this point is that there really a good way to specify that a page was written against a particular version of the we can specify doctypes for our html why i indicate that a document was written for css this will only become more important as we start adding more and more bizarre features to css that affect the actual content of the such as a future version of the standard is going to have errors one day that potentially break and be nice to let the document author ask for certain behavior rather than have browsers attempt to figure out the the lighter now that ie8 and ie7 are things really as bad as they were a specific ie6 stylesheet served with conditional comments can really go a long way to making a implementation the other advice is to to take the fluid layout and hope that someone else has done most of the troubleshooting for a compatible web site is standard or no you can make it easier on yourself if you accept that there will be some differences in the way different browsers render your be afraid of proprietary extensions by any means all right to have css3 rounded corners for your but have a for when they exist the rounded corners critical for using the and let your users choose how like to consume your

 are several factors at work files have no intrinsic metadata for describing their encoding all the talk of there are reasons xml is default encoding for windows is still an 8bit character set with a limited range of values text files written in this format are not tell a unicode file from an ansi windows apps rely on the presence of a order at the start of the file strictly true raymond chen in the bom is there to tell you the of the for even though there is only one byte windows apps rely on the marker bytes to automatically figure out that it is unicode note that notepad has an encoding option on its is wrong to say that java is broken because it does not write a bom on unix it would be an error to write a bom to a script for and many unix systems use as their default there are times when you want it on like when appending data to an existing new is a method of reliably appending data to a private static void boolean string throws ioexception boolean skipbom append closer res new try outputstream out writer writer if finally public static void throws ioexception string chinese boolean append if the file already existed and you chose to append and existing data the only thing that code will create is a is the type used in this class closer implements closeable private closeable public extends t closeable return public void throws ioexception if code makes a best guess about how to read the file based on byte order private static final private static charset throws ioexception for encodings bom for b if continue return return private static string throws ioexception closer res new try inputstream in inputstream bin reader reader stringbuilder out new for ch ch ch return finally public static void throws ioexception uses the default so whether it prints anything sensible depends on your platform and	
 are several in your question so answer them to the best of my currently is no portable way of implementing interactions in the proposal solves this by introducing the atomics is not guaranteed to provide atomicity on a multicore and its implementation is the you need to do anything except declare shared variables as volatile to prevent some compiler optimizations that may break multithreaded volatile tells the compiler not to cache are some algorithms for that work even on an x86 with volatile you know for sure that passing access to data between threads is a major performance bottleneck in your stay away from use passing data by value or	
 are several problems with the example you number one problem is that you are selecting the columns using jquery inside the this is a major performance if you have any control over the html code i would suggest you use normal dom methods to get the desired colum you want to sort note that sometimes when you might expect a table cell you may get a text get back to that a for loop is faster so you may consider using that instead of but i suggest you benchmark took your example and created a table with 1000 it took about 750ms on my machine to sort i did some optimizations code and managed to get it down to the sorting itself took around 20ms sb i i x rows columnindex t new new return new tbody delete you write for speed you want each iteration to be as quick as so do stuff in the loops that you can do outside of for moving outside of the last loop sped things up for using dom methods to access a what you need is the column so you could iterate over the th columns until you find the correct one the html formatting is identical for th tags and td you can then use that index to get the correct row child if the table is static and the users are liable to do more sorting on you should cache the rows and not delete the sortkey then you save about sort there is also the matter of the table if the content is this sorting method is if it contains numbers then you need to consider since i am using localecompare which is a method of the string

 are three approaches commonly taken in building a chat applet either find or build a java applet that communicates to a chat the applet can be an irc or a chat client with a custom even seen some websites use a java applet as a communication where the interface is all run by javascript and html in the but the javascript sends and accepts events from the applet to run the every time a use writes a send the message to the http where all the users connected are periodically polling for new using mainly each client establishes a connection to an http and when a message is being sent from the it is send over the already and instead of polling for new messages from other users just flow down the same i find the 3rd option to be the most but the most complex as you will probably need to build your own version of an http server to support the connection that comet and since a 16bit limit on the descriptors of sockets in be limited to about 64k per on your each client will need a open the techniques for building comet code are wildly different between there exist a few frameworks for but have to maintain them while new browsers come running a small and you want to face a surmountable then just go with ajax not too and learn a if you be then just find a java once configured with a matching never have to worry about maintaining since that solution is very of it requires that the java runtime environment be installed on the and not always going to be

 are working on a similar implementation to what you are describing as a proof of what we see as an for us consists of three separate servers to accomplish is a that is responsible for generating the indices that will be there is a service implementation that handles the workflows used to build these as well as being able to signal completion custom management api exposed via wcf web are two access to the api is provided via wcf services to the they sit behind a physical load balancer and will periodically the publication server to see if there is a more current set of indicies than what is currently if it it requests a lock from the publication server and updates the local indices by initiating a transfer to a local once it is just a matter of suspending the searcher while the index is it then releases its lock and the other server is available to do the i we are only approaching the proof of concept stage with as a replacement for our current which is a load balanced endeca the size of the indices and the amount of time it will take to actually complete the tasks required are the larger questions that have yet to be proved some random things that we are downtime of a given server could be reduced if two local folders are used on each machine receiving data to achieve a are looking to see if the load balancer allows programmatic access to have a node remove and add itself from the this would lessen the chance that a user experiences a hang if accesses during an are looking at in the event that cluster manipulation is not looked at while a lot of it just works out of the we have some bench time to explore this path as a learning exercise learning things like improving our wf and wcf and implementing mvc for a management worst case we go with something like but have gained experience in some skills we are looking to improve

 argument seems backwards to that a centralized revision control system is just one of many use cases of a distributed how does applying such a restriction benefit the know from experience that when a p4 server gets slow or breaks or you get too far away from it or using it has to stop like to treat the argument as a bit of a but been there where it really on site at an interop event or customer demo where we have to build something in an environment with limited network support and all that work has to come back i want to be able to revert when i make two arguments that heard ring well to take all the code and 1 is just maybe to get the full history if i not a revision control system but when it comes to the kind of fear talking about i can just grab the latest revision and just as 2 really seems like trying to use the wrong tool for the i used to get arguments from rcs users because they really thought you should lock file time to prevent two people i is out of if you have unmergeable ok to talk about i many of the people with this problem want a revision control but a snapshotting filesystem drop i understand why people even ask the should i give my developers tools that are more more and make them more kinds of	
 arithmetic between operands of different types is legal but the c standard defines rules for type promotion in order to convert the operands to a common automatic type promotion allows the compiler to do something sensible for but does not necessarily mean really know whether or not the behavior is correct you must first understand the rules for promotion and then understand the representation of the data in general types are converted to longer types to to types are converted to conversions favor avoiding data loss signed is converted or depends on the size of the respective code like and have different is right or wrong depends on the values that and can in my experience common practice to prohibit the coding implicit type the programmer must consider the context and explicitly perform any type conversions

 asking for seems to be basically a graph distance algorithm data computed from a set of pairwise a reasonable nicely metric is can be thought of construct a graph where each node is a and each edge represents the relevancy of the nodes it connects to each now imagine that starting at some node in the graph and randomly jumping to other nodes along defined say that the probability of jumping from skill a to skill b is proportional to the relevancy of those skills to each other by the relevancy of those to other skills now the commute time represents the average number of steps it takes to make it from skill a to skill has a very nice property that adding more paths between two nodes makes the commute time if skill a and b and c and and d and a are then the commute time between a and c will get shorter commute time can be computed quite easily using an eigenvalue decomposition of your sparsely connected skill graph think the reference i gave you shows but if not there are many you want to actually store the commute time between any pair of skills need a or nxn matrix is the number of a far nicer is as stated drop all connections weaker than some then store a sparsely connected graph as rows in a and i hope this

 basic there really a way to do what you are saying in a as you mentioned could be but required error only three ways i see to get around this some sort of framework that does all of the translating from error code to meaningful exceptions would probably do someone else mentioned that spring for the duplicate manually a prior to doing your be as its technically possible that someone could have done an insert after your you get any sql exception on the try to query for that if you can actually find the match you can be fairly sure that the error you received was due to a duplicate primary its possible that there was multiple and that actually the one that was recommendation would be to write your code to avoid the problem as much as and then absolutely use

 be an ideal the reason is that text in xps is represented by in which characters are specified as indexes into a particular table of character rather than in something handy like and the have to be specifically each character offset from the string if a string has to wrap onto multiple that has to be done by putting in many separate all individually not a logical but a physical and it particularly amenable to being altered after be much better off defining the template document as a a much more logically manipulable rather than a physical xps document is technically a you can then freeze a into a to export it as when it has been filled more about flow

 benefits of intellij idea 8 supports new functionality merge which may be useful especially if your team uses a lot of development branches and thus merging is detail i appreciated about idea as you probably idea has had for pretty long built on top of any underlying version control system this is a really useful now that subversion itself supports changelist implementation has been changed so that it is perfectly compatible with native be able to work with any changelists created in idea also when using command line tools in your perhaps it is not worthwhile to for at startup and file indexing seems to be somewhat slower in 8 than for me personally the upgrade was definitely worth because it solved a vcs problem with idea 7 it could hang for vcs sync to for an hour or whatever after hitting

 best and the easiest solution is to hire a technical writer who has knowledge of software this would make the documentation process a log easier and technical writers are considered as the best option as they are far more knowledgeable when it comes to writing the development process in simple english that can be understood by between codes are often used to briefly explain what the happens next in the program and cannot fully be considered as however they will come handy when a technical writer prepares a developers

 best bet would to be write an extension method on the htmlhelper that would use reflection to get the attributes from the the only problem is that passing would pass the value of the and you would need the i think you would probably need to pass the object and the property name as a static string htmlhelper object string string label string input prop type t propertyinfo pi array if label return label exact syntax of the helper may be because doing this from but you get the then just import the namespace of your extension method into the page and you can use this	
 best book found is web by leonard richardson and sam it describes the rest architectural pattern and contrasts it with other web service it describes how you would go about designing a restful interface and develops several examples over the course of the b is particularly it describes the http status codes and how they should be i refer to it the book above address wcf for want to read jon this book assumes got some familiarity with and want to know how to do restful things with you need a primer on look to michele leroux you can get the latest updated code samples from the book at her indigo a well written introduction to noteworthy is the book juval wcf which dives into a lot of but if sticking to restful you probably need this level of	
 best choice is to generate a hash of some of the for to generate a hash of row you could use something import basing your pseudorandom string only on a row id is not very as the user could easily reverse the hash of such a short simple solution here is to the hashed add the same secret string to every value that is for you probably the only result will be a link to this answer which is not a but a good hint that this hash is quite

 best i can think of with is the this tells to run as many jobs as possible in you want to limit the number of concurrent jobs to you can sure the dependencies are correct so run jobs it have thing to take into account is optimizations that does with the you can specify various levels of the higher the the longer the compile and link a project i work with runs takes 2 minutes to link with and half a minute with you should make sure not optimizing more than you need you could build without optimization for development builds and with optimization for deployment with debug info will probably increase the size of your executable and may impact your build if you need try removing it to see if it affects type of linking should make a as far as i understand static linking takes longer i may be wrong you should see if this affects your

 best or file includes all headers it needs and does not rely on headers including other related or file includes all its dependencies and does not rely on the included headers including other related header is wrapped do not include each others in there is a single header like or which is always included by any or typically this has platform related configuration constants and macros are not necessarily but rules which i usually follow headers are included as and before the which are included as headers are included in order as a way to ensure that there is no hidden requirement on which order they are as every header should include its dependents the headers should be protected against multiple you should be able to include them in any order you	
 best practice for a flex application is to create a utility class to manipulate instances of a class rather than to change the prototype of that for you might create a class with static functions that accept objects as the reason you want to follow this best practice is that flex uses the strict setting by and trying to access functions added to the prototype of a sealed class will throw compiler the turning off strict is not advisable because the compiler will not be able to optimize your code as well as it could under strict	
 best solution i have found is to make use of a simple piece of code i found in this simply use this code snippet in the namespace section of each test testclass testmethod testcleanup testinitialize classcleanup classinitialize nunitassert msassert in the code snippet refers to a custom build configuration for the you can create this using the vs configuration manager the vs toolbar or the solution you need to replace all instances of the test attribute on your methods to make use of the mstest testmethod attribute vice updated the code snippet above to include a possible fix for the issue pointed out in the i managed to test this the updated code snippet is taken from a comment by simon on this

 best suggestion is probably what parashift but read my caution note below as well parashift faq how can i handle a that an have a return so not possible to use the best way to constructor failure is therefore throw an if you the option of using is to put object into a state setting an internal status bit so object acts sort of like even though it is technically idea of a object has lot of you need to add query member function check this bit so users your class can find out if object is truly or if zombie a and just about every place construct one of your within a larger object an array of you need to that status flag via an if also want to add an if to other member if the is a do a or something more practice the thing pretty certainly you prefer exceptions over zombie but if you do not have the option using zombie objects be the word of caution with throwing exceptions in a very careful though because if an exception is thrown in a the destructor is not so you need to be careful about destructing objects that you already constructed before the exception is the same warnings apply to exception handling in but it is maybe a little less obvious when dealing with a virtual after exception is d public p new throw so p causes a memory char char b p new return constructors with createinstance way around this is to make your constructor private or protected and make a createinstance method that can return

 best way to do this will be to encrypt the sections during installation add an installer class to your project and override the install method in the in this method you should perform the you must call at the end of your overridden install in the setup project goto custom actions and locate the install custom action to be pointed with your project output or which contains the definition of your installer class this way it will encrypt your sections during an installation straight and you will not face this the application will automatically use dpapi provider to through sections or this

 better solution would be to use one or more object to store your points geometry can be drawn with a so you could indeed change the stroke thickness when you but more flexible is to use the transform the you can the actual coordinates of the geometric representation and not the visualization so when you draw you need to fiddle with render compute the i use the following code static matrix rect bool matrix translatethenscale first translate to origin since just we scale the graph to the appropriate we flip the graph vertically around the viewport middle since in our graph positive is not if we push the graph to the right which will usually simply be return the fromposition rect should contain the untransformed and the toposition rect should contain the transformed this also trivially allows for scaling x and y which is often necessary for easy to compute the bounds of your bounds are modified by the so we want no graphbounds set the transform if the transform is the following graphboundsalt of course wpf can tell you which bounds you need to render should that be putting it you could do something void bool rect graphbounds matrix transmat new advantage of using this solution is that you need to mess with free to use transforms that shear scale x and y independently without getting weird distortions in your and you can treat the pen as an opaque object easier to customize from the ui if you select pen width or no further correction is

 by writing tests for lower level parts of the spam filter you need to have in your mind a rough design of how the algorithm should then you isolate a core part of the algorithm and write tests for in the case of a spam filter that would maybe be calculating some simple probability using theorem know about bayesian so i could be you build it step by until finally you have all the parts of the algorithm implemented and putting them together is requires lots of practice to know which tests to write in which so that you can do tdd in small enough if you need to write much more than 10 lines of code to pass one new you probably are doing something start from something smaller or mock some of the safer err on the smaller so that the steps are too small and your progress is than trying to make too big steps and failing generic example that you have might be better suited for an it will probably even run very because you first need to initialize the spam filter with example so it be useful as a tdd tdd tests need to be as in many hundreds or thousands tests per

 calling a method through a null pointer or reference is strictly speaking undefined but it may succeed unless the call is virtual methods virtually a not from the derived class with way of always fails if the is null because virtual calls require access to vtable and accessing the vtable through a null is so you call an empty virtual method through a understand this you need to know more about how code is for every method a section of code segment containing the machine code implementing the a call is done from a derived class or a method through a the compiler knows exactly which method to call so it just inserts a call to an exact portion of code and passes pointer as the first parameter in case of calling through null pointer will be null but you care if your method is a call is done virtually a the compiler know which exactly method to it only knows that a table of virtual methods and the address of the table is stored in the in order to find what method to call necessary to first dereference the get to the get the address of method from it and only then call the reading the table is done in not during if the is null you get segmentation fault at this also explains why virtual calls be the compiler simply has no idea what code to inline when looking at the source during

 calling you inherit in the classical sense of the word instead you tell child to apply parents prototype onto itself and thus has cloned properties and methods from this has no issues performance wise whatsoever though so abandoning prototype for efficiency reasons is not a valid i can be honest i think enforcing oo paradigms onto javascript is the biggest mistake a javascript developer can much like having to learn to deal with immutability in functional programming trying to make javascript behave like classical oo will only work against you in the long answer your question but tons of different ways to apply super functionality to none of which i can recommend though as no definitive version that come with a downside somewhere down the

 cannot put a into an and what a a variable is a and so is an the difference is that a variable is not also an like the array and you can only put objects into an you pass to is not the variable but the object it what you are adding to the add the variable instead of the object inside you would need to do in order to pass a pointer to the variable but this for two i the variable is not an and you can only add this is a local it will perish when the function then you have a pointer to dead memory inside your when you go to access at that your program would are three solutions that will f3lix create a mutable number and create your number object from this class instead of need to override all the primitive methods of nsvalue as described in nsnumber the object in the array instead of mutating of this requires having access to the array from everywhere want to change the a model object class that has the number as a last solution in my the correct i doubt you are managing only a list of more you are showing the user a list of something that has the number as a model this in your and everything becomes much code after replacing the bare nsnumbers with model objects will be something time you decide to change the in mean cocoa the c language does call any an but this is a different

 careful not getting too anal about forcing you might want to collect a few sample examples from your most experienced get them to and use those as templates for atwood recently had an interesting blog entry about just a single aspect of to the space and in there he actually matter which coding styles you what does matter is that and everyone else on your sticks with those conventions and uses them

 categories woukld you use to rate your own use see also my answer to this

 certainly tempting to begin by learning one of the popular i would advise against it as a first they are the easiest ones to find help but they are also the languages with the most idiosyncratic limitations and twists due to the way things evolved with industrial a lot of confusing and difficult to have a critic eye without the perspective of the more exotic languages are often cleaner and simpler to especially if you have ideas about the communities are but that also means they are more fun and i think better to learn the bases first with a very language and an interactive you could go through to design an excellent book which goes from simple math to advanced have a look at with or is probably not a bad idea to experiment with when you want to go to more popular there is and the web languages like html and c will be nice when you wonder how things really work with the reserve java and for when you need a they are not that fun anyways

 choose whether to use an sql database based on how much data i wanted to store i would choose based on of data i wanted to store and how it is to be defines a database database is a structured collection of records or data that is stored in a computer and i think your answer lies if you want to store records such as customer access rights and so on then a db such as mysql or sqlite or whatever is not they give you a tried and trusted mechanism for managing those on the other your website stores and delivers unchanging content such as mp3s and so on then simply storing them in a directory layout on a disk is more than i would also include xml documents if you had for example a production department that created articles for a website in xml format there is no need to put them in a db store them on disk and use xslt to deliver choice of sql or not will also depend on how the content you wish to store is to be sql is obviously good for retrieving many records based on search criteria whereas a directory xml rdf etc are more likely to be used to retrieve single of storage mechanism is very important when trying to scale site and stuffing everything into a sql db will quickly become a

 class needs a reference to the form for this to the reason for this is that the form is not a static class so you can have multiple instances of best way of giving it the reference would probably be to pass it in the classes then the class would have a reference to the form and could use that reference to change the alternative option that you could use if you are sure that you will have only one instance of your form open is to add a public static property to the forms class that returns the instance of the that property would then be available to be used in your other make sure that your controls are or better add public methods to your form that can be used to manipulate the controls

 common called has been built for the runtime like garbage collection and was previously the barrier to phobos and tango interoperating in the same higher level functionality depended on the phobos runtime and likewise for major update to phobos has been released yesterday as a matter of this update tries to make use of some of the new features of d2 and introduces the concept of which are like iterators but easier to work with and more d2 phobos is very different from its underpowered d1 is by far the better standard library for a d2 port is in and will likely progress much more rapidly when d2 is a big question is whether the tango devs will update it to take full advantage of the d2 or whether they will simply focus on making it work with d2 the same way it does with the two phobos tends to focus more on making simple things syntactic convenience and pushing the envelope of what can be done in a standard something of a cross between stl and standard as weird as that tango tends to have more of a feel to more focused on breadth of features and handling unusual use cases it stays more within the sane subset of d as much template though arguably a major feature of d is to promote template metaprogramming to sane subset and takes a more pragmatic approach to api own guess but it makes a lot of is that phobos will become analogous to a truly standard library of core and tango will become a utility kind of like as more of its core functionality is absorbed into phobos as others d1 is supposed to be so nothing is changing

 compiler in calculating an incorrect address for some of the class the culprit turned out to be a pack directive hidden in an obscure header file that was in some of the source i found and math came across a very simple class with few methods and most of which were defined in the header int makes my skin return the function returned when i was watch window showed the correct programmatic changes to were reflected in the watch on showed that it began 8 bytes into the raw memory window showed the correct programmatic changes to were reflected there as 4 bytes before were all which i interpreted to be the debugger through the code clearly showed a return value of i checked the disassembly window and found this are ptr address of the class ptr offset to other the compiler calculated the offset as when it should have been when i removed the definition of from the header and placed it into my source address was calculated that convinced me that it a packing and a search of the code base for quickly identified the an ancient header file that required alignment on boundaries but never reset the packing to the solution was as easy as enclosing the offending header like original code for your and if about to on my	
 compiler is optimizing away a variable that is never it cannot optimize a function on the grounds that it will not be as it could be used from a different compilation you could try to force the compiler into considering the variable as used with something akin mark the variable as if it is new return the compiler cannot know if p will be it must better solution would be to explicitly instantiate the template if you want t const value void t const whatever t template implementation another not included from t const value t const v explicit class class 7 linker error not code will only see the header and know what methods but not the real the implementation will be compiled in one compilation where the explicit template instantiation that if you forget to explicitly instantiate one it will be a linker not a compilation one definition one definition rule in states that there can be only one definition for each symbol or having multiple definitions can be detected easily for regular symbols you define two the linker will detect the duplicated but is a little trickier with with templates it is trickier as they are usually declared and defined in header the compiler generates the used symbols in each compilation unit and the linker usually finds more than one equivalent symbol is compiled into each compilation unit that has a and calls compiler flags the templated code as a signifying that while the symbol is defined it can also be defined in another compilation unit and the linker is free to discard the symbol without yielding a link that is a requirement if you want to link different compilation units that make use of the same stl for with the same to gcc gcc linux linker discards all but one of the weak symbols without further some linkers linker in linux will in the near not as know nor it could be alredy do check that the different symbols are in fact the same and provide an to the code is the odr in that you are redeclaring the template in a different you should declare the template once and the implement the methods externally as posted anyway if both definitions are compatible they are in the snippet you all member methods and attributes are exactly the same and with the same qualifiers it should be accepted by the compiler as there is only one definition of the only those methods that are actually called in the code will be void void compiler generates but not

 complexity is just one variable that impacts the overall performance of a other factors might include network latency or network especially when the size of the returned data is you run the same algorithm on a local you will get the results faster than if you run the algorithm on a machine on another continent and need the same results sent over the factors might include raw cpu speed if the calls are done on physically different why premature optimisation is the root of all say it depends even more now on the details of the what database software you are or whether or not your web service is reading data from a static web page or dynamically generating the i am beginning to lose sight of why you are asking the you seem to say that both methods take the same amount of so if they take the same amount of how can you ask which is clearly they are equally you need to tell us more about how and when they stop taking the same amount of

 confusing api is the eternal bane of library make it even for people to decide exactly what they want to do given the interface you if they must pick from a lengthy list of overloaded probably too much cognitive worth noting that 4 will have support for optional and named so your problem will go away by it frowned upon in terms of favors the responsibility or if you have a single class with many of these each having many that suggests that it may be doing too it decrease in you have a lot of overloads for the same it takes longer to resolve each function call method with this name is the right but not going to have a impact on performance if nonvirtual calls that where the compiler can statically know exactly what type something is going to either i think that should be your motivating factor

 consider this is a good place to apply bounded ideally you be integrating different through the this should be happening at the api you might already have it structured like all the sites are populating a single shared information for all the what it is really about is each site saving whatever info it needs about the process it is about to and getting an id that will hand to the payment payment system force unique ids across different web it can force that each web site sends an unique id in their own the payment system needs extra it should also require it at the api instead of forcing a db relation between all the sites and the payment can have the sites call an api on the payment site to start the payment process and then redirect to the you can use either an id controlled by each web or a common id that the payment site returns after the initial payment that in the repositories would be use internally and independent by the sites and the payment service to persist this necessarily means it has to be a as you can persist information to other

 conversion using the operator is a it will convert both to a common type and compare the way strings are converted to integers is that the you linked contradict check the second where it says that comparing the integer to a string using shall be happens is that the string is converted to and strings that do not contain or begin with a convert to vs string that consists of a or begins with a is considered a if the string has other characters after that these are a string starts with a character that cannot be interpreted as part of a then it is a and will convert to this mean that a numeric string has to start with a digit for example is a numeric string because the minus sign is part of a number in that for your string does not start with a so it would convert to but your second string would be converted to integer so why your second test does not work the same you should probably the use of triple equals instead of a double this ensures that what you are comparing is a string that contains the digit zero and prevents any type

 cost of an index in disk space is generally the cost of additional writes to update the index when the table changes is often the cost in additional locking can be depends on the read vs write ratio on the and on how often the index is actually used to speed up a	
 cost of memory allocation is generally much lower in a garbage collected memory then when just using new or malloc explicitly because garbage collectors generally this explicit memory models may also do this memory pools or memory making the cost of memory allocation equivalent to a pointer and pointed managed languages tend to out perform unmanaged languages in the general after pushing the unmanaged language can and will eventually beat the same thing is also evident in the language because even though tends to rank higher than java most of the often see implementations jumping trough various hoops as object to achieve optimal garbage collected tend to have easier to follow and more straight forward implementations because the gc is better at allocating chunks performance the biggest difference when it comes to gc vs arguably the deterministic finalization of reference languages that is the biggest argument for explicit memory management because this is generally used for purposes other than memory management as releasing closing file or window handles et however introduced the using idisposable construct to do exactly problem with garbage collection is that the systems they use tend to be rather complex to prevent memory this also makes it way more difficult to debug and track down once you do have a memory leak even garbage collected languages can have memory the flip the garbage collected language can do the most optimal thing at the most optimal time without having to burden the developer with that this means that developing for a gc language might be more so you can focus more on the

 could use collision be able to decide whether two convex polygons are intersecting each we can use the separating axis two convex polygons are not there exists a line that passes between a line only exists if one of the sides of one of the polygons forms such a first statement is since the polygons are both be able to draw a line with one polygon on one side and the other polygon on the other side unless they are the second is slightly less look at figure unless the closest sided of the polygons are parallel to each the point where they get closest to each other is the point where a corner of one polygon gets closest to a side of the other this side will then form a separating axis between the if the sides are they both are separating how does this concretely help us decide whether polygon a and b we just go over each side of each polygon and check whether it forms a separating to do this be using some basic vector math to squash all the points of both polygons onto a line that is perpendicular to the potential separating line figure now the whole problem is conveniently we can determine a region in which the points for each polygon and this line is a separating axis if these regions do not after checking each line from both no separating axis was it has been proven that the polygons intersect and something has to be done about

 couple of i have refrained myself from studies and have been focusing on this is this grid which constitutes a square of 100 available places to the aim is to start from a corner and traverse through all the places with respect to some simple and reach number 100 99 if a programmer and start with 0 instead rules for traversing two spaces hop along the vertical and horizontal one space hop along the you can visit each square only visualise here is a valid example traverse to the 8th i have been working on this puzzle out of for i have tried to solve it by hand from time to but i have never gone beyond sounds try yourself and see for yourself in order to solve the i have developed a short 100 lines of program in i am a beginner in this language i wanted to see what i can program simply applies exhaustive try error solving in other brute force depth first question arises from here the unfortunately cannot solve the problem because the state space is so big that search never ends withouh ever finding a it can go up to number 98 prints without much nonetheless not a complete program also prints out the length of the search tree it has covered so in a couple of the traverse list 65th element is covered till the for just one single this number decreases in exponentially increasing time i have run the code for quite some time and could not get beyond 50 barrier and now i am seems that this simple approach will not be enough unless i run it for how can i improve my code to be faster and more efficient so that it comes up with i am looking forward to see ideas on how and exploit specific to this to overcome finally realize into a substantial in to dave webb for relating the problem to domain it is very similar to the tour problem which relates moving knight around a chess board revisiting the same the same problem but different the square	
 couple of i would recommend using the routedcommand for implementing the handling of the save you checked out the wpf command you can get the scoop to implement the you can add a command binding to the or to the button these in code void executedroutedeventargs void canexecuteroutedeventargs set based on the validity of the binding on the text you want to implement using the mvvm design check out josh post on final if you want the to be updated as soon as the value in the is set on the binding for the if you want to based on all of the bindings in the here are a few you are already implementing try implementing the property such that it returns the string that is invalid for all of the properties that you are binding this will only work if your whole control is binding to a single data set use reflection to get all of the public static dependencyproperties on the relevant then call in a loop on each property so you can test the in the manually create a collection of all bound properties on nested in iterate through this collection and validate each combination by using to get expressions and then examining

 couple of years i ran into the very same issue at an ecommerce company where we upgraded their website to the main issue is that we had no idea how many customers had the old asp pages in their as well as the issue of yes you can map the asp extension to but you lose the ability to run the asp files at so that would require that you update all asp which may not be best solution i found at the time was to implement an isapi redirection filter in this is an app that is run by iis the asp or it would make a decision based on the url or any rules you whether it should allow the asp files to run or whether they should be or use to handle the it is not always a clean since it runs before your request and confusion can happen later if other developers know it is so make sure if you go this that your website has plenty of comments or documentation to let developers know there is this thing in iis is a good explanation of how to implement this in code go here and check it

 current private implementation is private to everything outside the unit it is declared so if your reasoning for not wanting to add the statements is that you want to modify your existing then you have nothing to gain except breaking any existing code that accesses the class in the same as long as your existing units are not then the difference between and is your reasoning for the behavior is to use the compiler to help you code that takes advantage of the then adding the to one class at a time is a good incremental approach so you can get to a compilable and testable state more a whole sale change of behavior would require fixing every violation before you knew if any of them reason behaves like it does is similar to it allows certain classes procedural to access the and makes heavy use of this so a compiler switch or an all out change would break all of that implementation of is private enough for all practical purposes since typically you control the unit your class is declared if you only ever one class per and never include procedural then the difference is only	
 current standard incorporates the c some fine print regarding type safety put that means c89 should compile fine in a problem is that the current c standard is that of 1999 which is yet officially part of the standard that means that many of the features of c99 long while by many are strictly c means something else and has little to do with official it means that your code does not make assumptions on the host size of functions or errno stuff like a coding style guide i once wrote for a dna not are no native the only datatypes you might use are those declared in the standard int and long are of different size just like and long is not 32 is neither signed nor cannot hold a only a short type into a longer one breaks alignment rules of the and are of different and are of different size are pointers to any other do remember the native datatypes do not even does not yield the same result as does not yield the same result as and is not equal to cannot do anything with a null pointer except test its dereferencing it will crash the involving both signed and unsigned types do not rules for datatypes change layout of datatypes changes behaviour of and underflows changes abis change are evaluated in random the compiler can work around this the randomness will change with the next release of the cpu os and only work for pointers to the exact same work only for pointers into the same they work only for explicitly declared still remember the native datatypes do not type of the return value of can not be cast into any other type of the return value of substracting one pointer from the can not be cast into any other type of a the exact nature of which is can not be cast into any other datatype cannot be cast into any other this was true at the time of things have changed a bit with but the gist of my answer holds

 currently have three daterequested description title info idea is that each request shows the information common to all types of requests and additional fields are presented to the users to be filled in depending on the request type would i change the models to allow this and how would i write the view to display the form to the user so that the additional information is displayed with the base would it be better to have a second view which asks for the additional end aim is that the admins can create new request types without creating models in python by just adding a new request and adding any additional info model structure for many to many relasionship based on third	
 currently looking at a hefty rails test nothing i can get into specifics but the run time for the entire suite can run upward of 5 completely reliant on fixtures and are not mocking and stubbing as much as we should next few sprints are going to be completely focused on the test both improving writing better tests and most importantly writing more efficient aside from more mocking and stubbing within our considering replacing our fixtures with most likely factory i see a lot of happy folks doing similar situations but been able to find a good resource on any minuses of moving to a i have seen some slower benchmarks when using benchmarks from various resources but cannot find a definitive this why factories are good and this is why you might not want to use anyone educate me on why or why i be using and minuses of using factories in a rails test

 currently translating a java project to flex a large part of the project involves asynchronous program will connect to a start downloading shortly after it will need to download context data in the same format by at various points during the stream or additional http calls may be to get an encryption use a blocking call to perform the http requests to get the key which would effectively pause the keyframe or stream while the http is which would then carry on where it flex being and http requests being implemented with asynchronous impossible to implement the code in the same new to not sure what the normal practice would be for planning to save the state and relying on the http completion to the paused or maybe use timers for the should i decouple the data being received from the processing it and buffer it while the http requests are being or is it safe to ignore the progress events and let flex the os buffer anyone have any advice on an architecture which would make all this thanks for the answers so far not sure i understand what getting but look into one of the connections is already a raw the question was about pausing it and grabbing some other data from another source that looks to flex translating asynchronous comms from

 development team has run into a design hoping someone can help me clean this part of the architecture up a my i have an enum with 250 members member represents a distinct drop in order to populate the drop downs on any given that form sends in the enum members that relate to the drop downs and the drop down information is other say for we have 3 window a has drop downs y and window b has drop downs x and y and window c has drop downs u and my dropdowntype enum would consist of and so for a specified given the drop downs on that i query for the data to appear in those drop is a simplified example because my application consists of 250 distinct drop you can i have a factory setup to return the data for each drop and this factory is called for each drop down switch case return t in select new dropdowndto dropdowndisplayname dropdownvalue case return u in select new dropdowndto dropdowndisplayname dropdownvalue i have so many members in this does anyone know of a more elegant way of coding do you think transforming this into factory methods would be helpful then have to worry about 250 separate files in our is there another pattern out there that is more just having this huge switch statement is getting help is greatly thanks in to handle a massive factory in a cleaner

 disagree with the by bug concept even the tester is inside or of directly counting the number of you can use some rating mechanism concerning the severity i mean to measure the carelessness of the a programmer is writing a code without handling the this problem is bigger than a error in complex logic in a complex so using a rating mechanism for each bug would be better for such a in that case each will get a fair weight and we can get a overall idea about the performance using the sum of the error the other hand this approach also can make problems because the rating is also done by human but having a team for make this rating will reduce such problems and the mechanism will get more usable with the time with necessary improvements and its your duty to sub group the bug categories and assign them the necessary i think you cannot do this at this also should get matured over time with

 do this because you end up with a problem who owns the package that almost everything else is a subpackage method of establishing package heirarchy the filesystem does not play well with this convention at java can get away with it because package heirarchy is defined by the structure of the string literals fed to the so there need to be an explicit package also the question of what to do if you want to publicly release a package but own a domain name suitable for bodging into the package or if you end up changing your domain name for some later updates need a different package how do you know that is a newer version of how do you know that a newer if you miss your domain renewal and the name gets snatched by a domain and someone else buys the name from and they want to publicly release software should they then use the same name that you had already names and software package it seems to address two entirely different and have entirely different complicating i personally dislike convention because it violates separation of avoiding namespace collisions is nice and but i hate the thought of my namespace being defined by dependent the marketing interaction with some clarify my point in response to in a package is a directory containing an file presumably one or more module a package hierarchy requires that each package be a legitimate if two packages from different but even packages from the same share a package whether that name is or or or each one provide an for that we must also assume that these packages are likely to be installed in the same place in the directory the filesystem thus enforces that there is only so which one there is not cannot a correct answer to that nor can we reasonably merge the two files since we know what another package might need to do in that subpackages sharing a package cannot be assumed to work when both are installed unless they are specifically written to be compatible with each other least in this one this would be a distribution nightmare and would pretty much invalidate the entire point of nesting this is not specific to package though they provide the most obvious bad example and are philosophically questionable really the practical issue of shared rather than the philosophical that are my main concern the other a single large package using subpackages to better organize itself is a great since those subpackages specifically designed to work and live this is not so common in because a single conceptual package tend to require a large enough number of files to need the extra layer of

 does the but you should keep in mind that does guarantee uniqueness if you have multiple processes running phusion multiple or a because you might get this sequence of events order is a gets a request to create a new user with the name b does the same a validates the uniqueness of by asking the db if that name exists yet and the db says the name exist b does the same thing and gets the same a submits the statement for the new record and you have a database constraint requiring uniqueness for that process b will submit the statement for the new record and with a ugly server exception that comes back from the sql if you do not have a database the insert will succeed and you now have two rows with as the also and in the rails on rails 3rd its really guarantee that column values will be all it can do is verify that no column has the same value as that in the record being validated at the time the validation is possible for two records to be created at the same each with the same value for a column that should be and for both records to pass the most reliable way to enforce uniqueness is with a also with way this commonly happens is accidental from a web page when creating a new this is a hard one to solve because what the user will get back is the second error and it will make them think their registration when in reality it the best way found to prevent this is just to use javascript to try to prevent

 easy to get a the getting started you have an ec2 account you can enable mapreduce and have a sample application up and running in less than 10 minutes using the aws management did the word count sample which returns a count of each word contained in about 20 mb of you can provision up to 20 instances to run though i just used 2 instances and the job completed in about 3 job returns a 300 kb alphabetized list of words and how often each word appears in the sample really like that mapreduce jobs can be written in my choice of or the process was painless and and the interface gives good feedback on the status of your instances and the job aware since aws charges for a full hour when an instance is and since the mapreduce instances are automatically terminated at the end of the job the cost of multiple job flows can add up if i create a job flow that uses 20 instances and returns results in 15 and then the job flow 3 more be charged for 80 hours of machine time even though i only had 20 instances running for 1

 easy way to map this is turn it into a many to one and store the current id on the vehicle i understand this might be a schema way to trick this would be to create a view that would essentially be the vehicle table plus it would pull the current this way you have to change the you would then map to the view instead of the not sure if defining your own loader would work in this case but its one more option to understand your the easiest way would to be modify the schema and the application to add this additional column one way to fake it would be with a so for join owner on is assume here the current owner has a null end now you change your mapping to map to the view instead of the yes this is a hack but it will am assuming you still need owner to be mapped within another option would be to add a where filter on the class mapping to filter where end date is option you have is to load all the owners and push the business rule that defines the current owner to the application your object might look owner get return null if your using a nullable set

 edit the dump file so that after 300 inserts you start a new into snip into can do this by just opening your file in any text just plain sometimes a backup might be a or but just if you decompress these gzipped or bzipped end up with a single file which you can edit probably be too hard to write a script to split each statement after an arbitrary number of the basic program logic would look like a line that starts with the line up until the end of the word through all the following counting up as you your counter reaches then add a semicolon to the end of the last line and paste in the statement from reset your counter to 1 and go to step you reach a line that starts with reset the counter to 1 and go to step you could just do this one and then make sure that all future backups use extended phpmyadmin lets you set a maximal statement size when creating an so do the above for what you did with the memory limit is probably a much easier for anyone else in a similar situation who change those try the

 every break on the getting to the root of the exception is very crucial and time taking the web applications are in multi user environment and stateless asynchronous really a tough job to look at the eventviewer log files and root cause an issue reported by the end also it depends on how educated the to explain the issue in came up with a creative way to log the which makes the job easier for the end user and dev will follow a signature to log the exceptions into an xml and which can be processed remotely for viewing or reports on signature of the static method in the error logging class is as number module layer custom with stack know there are many reusable exception handling but what i was looking at is a unique number to track the issue that should get displayed to the end back to the user the exception is expected to handled and consumed then up the developer to show the valid message to the end incase of any unexpected or exception is thrown to the application layer global the response would be cleared and custom message in html will be written back to the user with the unique id like the below an unexpected error has occurred the exception has be recorded for further please use the number to communicate the support team details number this is the unique number generated for every a read only property in the errorlogging class which would be unique per exception this would be concatenation of the initially i thought to use guid but then it would be tough for the end user to remember the guid to report the string strexceptionid get return name this would be a static enum variable with module modulename module3 this would be a static enum variable with priority developer has to decide the priority like if a validation fail of date or integer format use or if its unexpected in a business layer call then use think priority high should be used in only in dal or in business logic layer or like if the interface to sap or ariba enum priority high medium low would be a static enum variable with layer enum layer dataaccess custom message is optional and its upto the developer to supply an information to help explain the reason or empty string can be with stack trace this would the exception object which would be further processed inside the processing done inside the error log method method will additionally get the userid and timestamp and write it to the xml xml logging will enable us to process an use it in any the exceptions can be viewed remotely in a easy to trace and find any we can search sort exception based on priority time stamp we can generate reports module level layer wise priority dependency on the xml if its lost all the exceptions would go for a we can overcome this in two writing the xml to db on timely basis or write this on top of event viewer logging as always have the on the review comments post the xml schema and the aspx page to view and search the take time to review and give ur review comments for my error logging

 every tried this setup but i can take a guess at what is going usercotnrols are meant to be loaded by not by you are attempting to create them by notice the difference between how you refer to them in the inner project and how it differs from the outer i believe to get this to work you will need to refer to the path location of the quick search shows how this can be done in vs 2005 but the concept should be the same in vs you can find that information option would be to not use the design surface and instead load the controls using the loadcontrol passing in the path to the important thing to take from the link i mention above is that you must make the files accessable for your outer the above link does this by using a command to copy the files to a sub folder in the outer think of the inner project as if you were going to redistribute you would have to give away not only the but also the for users to consume it they must reference the files and have their project reference your you must do the same thing as hope that is a little

 example the decision whether to use or involve any kind of has a net benefit any there are many similar scenarios and any discussion in these realms are a waste of i believe very important to know what the target compiler is capable of optimizing small code the truth modern compilers are good at jason has an concerning an optimized factorial the other compilers can be surprisingly stupid as the key is that many optimizations require a control flow analysis which becomes np ever optimization thus becomes a between compilation time and the locality of an optimization plays a crucial role because the computation time required to perform the optimization increases just too much when the code size regarded by the compiler increases by just a few as others have these minute details are still relevant and always will be the forseeable although compilers get smarter all the time and machines get so does the size of our data grow in losing this particular in many the amount of data grows much faster than computers get	
 examples you gave should have absolutely no performance difference in and i doubt they would differ in python confusing it with a different i i i i latter is faster in some architectures because the act of decrementing the variable will set the zero which can then be checked in a giving you the loop iteration and the conditional in one the former example needs to perform an explicit comparison or a subtraction to set a and then jump based on most of the time the compiler can optimise the first case into the second if it sees that the variable is effectively a and on some combinations instructions may be generated that make the first method more like the things like this are only worth trying if you have a tight inner loop that your profiler is telling you is but never notice the difference if there even is

 found this question very interesting since i had recently done some work on modeling projectile motion with you are essentially updating the position and velocity using an euler where each new value for the states should be a function of the old in such a you should be updating the position then updating the there are more realistic physics models for effect of drag one model by involves a drag force that is proportional to the velocity as which generally applies to low velocity the one i previously suggested involves a drag force that is proportional to the of the velocity as quadratic which generally applies to high velocity address each one with regard to how you would deduce formulas for the maximum velocity and the time required to effectively reach the maximum forego the complete derivations since they are rather equation for updating the velocity would acceleration represents the following differential a the first entry in integral we can find the solution v 0 at t maximum velocity occurs when t so that the second term in the equation is very close to zero the time needed to reach the maximum note that the equation never truly reaches but instead asymptotes towards when the argument of the exponential equals the velocity is around of the maximum probably close enough to consider it you can then approximate the time to maximum velocity can then use these two equations to solve for and given a desired and equation for updating the velocity would acceleration represents the following differential a the first entry in integral we can find the solution v 0 at t maximum velocity occurs when t so that the exponential terms are much greater than 1 and the equation the time needed to reach the maximum note that the equation never truly reaches but instead asymptotes towards when the argument of the exponential equals the velocity is around of the maximum probably close enough to consider it you can then approximate the time to maximum velocity is also equivalent a desired and the second equation for will tell you what should and then you can plug that in to the equation for to get the value for seems like a bit of but these are actually some of the simplest ways to model anyone who wants to see the integration steps can shoot me an email and send them to they are a bit too involved to type i immediately realize but the updating of the velocity is not necessary anymore if you instead use the formulas i derived for if you are simply modeling acceleration from and you are keeping track of the time since the acceleration the code would look something is one of the two formulas for and you would no longer need a velocity in there is a calculating may be more computationally expensive than simply updating velocity with an iterative scheme to the exponential but it is guaranteed to remain stable and under certain conditions trying to get a very short the iteration can become unstable and a common problem with the forward euler maintaining limits on the variables 0 should prevent these if feeling somewhat you may be able to integrate the formula for to get a closed form solution for thus foregoing the need for a newton iteration leave this for others to

 general answer is that garbage will tend to be collected less often but the gc pauses will tend to be is assuming you already have more memory available to the vm than your working set otherwise you might be spending a lot of time in garbage gc characteristics vary greatly depending on which collector you are using and which version of and whether you specified a higher in addition to the higher older versions of java did not resize the young generation space after the vm had so even if you specified a really large the size of the young generation would still be really small so you would see frequent young generation a young generation collection there will be some objects that will be promoted to the tenured space even though they are this means that the tenured generation will slowly fill up with dead young requiring periodic full the number of such objects that end up in the tenured generation is proportional to the number of young gcs constant activity in your so the advantage of a larger young generation is that there will be fewer young generation and therefore fewer objects from the young collection will be promoted to the tenured are a number of tuning parameters besides for java and you will have to experiment with them since the optimal settings will vary for each

 generally a bad idea to unit test the the very nature of uis make them problematic for automated and are changed much more frequently than other in ways that will break any many automated tests are solvable only by taking image which is obviously very timing concerns become extremely and such automation relies on taking control of the entire including devices such as the keyboard and this means that no other activity can be done on the system while the tests are run for fear of breaking the running much better to move as much of the functionality out of the ui as humanly possible such as help with and test that functionality if you must insist on creating automated tests for the best served to use an automation library designed just for for winforms and is a good example of such a

 glad you was thinking of asking a question like does cpan have to suck so but decided it worth sacrificing my reputation when i already know the and since this question is marked thank you for not moderating me down for giving my personal take on this even if you think i am mistaken or some i did quite a lot of perl coding in the and enjoyed but eventually concluded that the language lacked a lot features that were needed for i became a developer for several and now am now a very technical project i still use perl for scripts and data crunching and other bits and and have recently started using perl scripts to test the web services our coders have i came to for the but stayed for the pleased to see the language has grown up and has all sorts of fantastic like moose and mvc and templates and so and would like to be using and i but it is taking and i only have a few hours now and then to work with why it to answer the the obvious most perl programs need cpan more than one way to do i need modules to do a lot of things that i would use modules for if it was easy to do for i have been parsing xml documents with and regular i know wrong the first step to recovery is admitting you have a but i can copy and paste the code to do this in a few or i could go away and try and make cpan work for another month or lets get a little more cpan is earlier this year i tried to use cpan to install moose because i had read great things about it and was keen to do proper oo programming in perl and for it not to be so i followed the install and pressed hundreds of time before getting dumped on with pages and pages of compiler warnings in the final what the hell do i do my main dev box has some sort of moose module just waiting am to bite me in the ass when i least expect that was about two months and i have not been i speculate that lots of have dependencies on other programming languages and that makes it more brittle opposed to languages whose libraries are coded in the same i further speculate that experiences like this scare potential users for cpan beginners is where is the authoritative cpan documentation the introduction and tutorials for and how was i supposed to know i have been reading cpan documentation on and off for a few and am starting to figure out where things see that almost all individual perl modules on cpan are beautifully documented but it took me a long time to find that install process is too four steps and hundreds of prompts may have been okay ten years ago when there were fewer packages and fewer but now it is just why i just type something like in my shell and have it be this is particularly given that advanced users often claim portability is a citing things like packages and par that i still and why is installing locally even harder when so many people seem to want to do are vexing like whether i should install cpan modules with cpan or with the package management where advice is more there is more than one way to do and when you start doing advanced you have to make decisions about how to install modules and what modules to use and where do you remember a beginner and the documentation is kind of fragmented and the learning curve is my solution has been to try and work around this by not using cpan while i read a little advanced perl has a very steep learning advanced perl users apparently do not remember this and cannot see imo there is a world of difference between using perl as it was originally conceived as a practical extraction and reporting language with powerful regular expressions and using it as a modern development platform with oo and templates and mvc and all sorts of other i have yet to find a incremental path from casual perl use to advanced perl there you apologies for the d

 going to have to give us some more detail about the exact structure of your data and filters to really be able to help you are the filters being used to select a subset of or to modify the what are the filters there are a few general less is there some way you can limit the amount of data working some that can run quickly and cut it down before you do your main out of the inner loop as soon as if one of the filters rejects a then break out of the inner loop and move on to the next if this is then you should also try to make the most selective filters come is assuming that your filters are being used to reject items out of the rather than modify for in the computation the filters if each of them performs some complicated calculations that share some then perhaps or may be used to avoid redundant it all boils down to the first less at all three levels of your can you do less work by limiting the items in the outer do less work by stopping after a particular filter and doing the most selective filters do less work by not doing any redundant computation inside of each

 got a webservice which is executed through javascript to retrieve data from the i would like to make sure that only my web pages can execute those web methods i want people to execute those web methods directly they could find out the url by looking at the source code of the javascript for planning to do is add a parameter to all the the key will be stored in the web pages in a hidden field and the value will be set dynamically by the web server when the web page is the key value will only be valid 5 this when a webmethod needs to be javascript will pass the key to the webmethod and the webmethod will check that the key is valid before doing whatever it needs to someone wants to execute the webmethods they have the key which will make them unable to execute your views on is there a better do you forsee any problems with my for what the visitors are not logged in so i use a i understand that if someone really wants to break they can parse the html code and get the value of the hidden field but they would have to do this regularly as the key will change every x which is of course possible but hopefully will be a pain for what doing is a web application opposed to a web the data is retrieved through web methods i would like to prevent anyone from building their own web application using my data they could if they can execute the web obviously it would be a risk for them as i could change the web methods at any will probably just go for the referrer not perfect but easy to i want to spend too much time on this as some of you said if someone really wants to break find a solution anyone from executing your web

 got nothing in answers here focus on oop but encapsulation begins much method is an x 4 y 42 d encapsulates the calculation of the distance between two points in a it hides implementation this is pure and is the process of taking a concrete implementation and making it applicable to albeit somewhat types of the classical example of abstraction is function which sorts thing about is that it care about the data it sorts in it what data it its input type is a typeless pointer which is just way of saying care about the type of is also called type the important point is that the implementation of always stays the regardless of data the only thing that to change is the compare which differs from data type to data therefore expects the user to provide said compare function as a function

 graphs model intuitively model computer networks and the often nodes will represent or while edges represent connections between these any data structure that makes use of pointers to link data together is making use of a graph of some this includes tree structures and linked lists which are used all the and trying to find shortest or longest paths from some location to a destination makes use of this can include pathing like you see in an application like google or calculating paths for ai characters to take in a video and many other similar a common problem in ai is to find some goal that satisfies a list of for for a university to set course it needs to make sure that certain courses that a professor teaching two courses at the same that the lectures occur during certain and so constraint satisfaction problems like this are often modeled and solved using graphs can be used to model atoms and molecules for studying their interaction and structure among other

 guido himself announced that the reverse domain convention ought to be it be unless there were significant changes to the implementation of in python searches an import path at with a java searches a path with an exhaustive algorithm both at and go try arranging your directories like import import one of those statements will because either or comes higher on the search when python sees it grabs the first package it if that happens to contain then the first will if it throws an and gives because must occur at potentially at any point in the flow of the code most often at the nobody wants an exhaustive at that point to verify that no possible it assumes that if it finds a package named it is python distinguish between the following com import import import concept of verifying that is is going to be different in each in you really only have to deal with the second and that can be accomplished by walking through the file system guess an advantage of naming classes and files the in if you tried to accomplish import with nothing but file system the first case could be transparently the same the second case could be but you would lose the initial running of but the third case is entirely the code has to execute for to be and this is another main does more than resolve it executes you get away with this if every python package ever distributed required an installation process that searched for the and then the and so on and so but this makes packaging considerably destroys and makes packaging and

 had this subject before but i find anything your needs might where no sanity check one might be required in the if you change your public fields to this breaks binary every client who uses your would have to is because it potentially costs a lot of properties from the beginning avoids this this even counts for code that is not part of a because you never the code if highly might prove useful so you want to refactor it to a this refactoring process is obviously made much easier if you are already using properties in place of writing public properties is easy in because you can just use the saving you quite a bit of datatype myproperty implement the necessary backing field and code for will add a personal behaviour in this regard is somewhat the compiler could just change public fields to properties on the thus avoiding the vb6 already did this for classes and i see absolutely no reason for and not to do the perhaps someone on the compiler teams could comment on

 hard to say exactly what this without more i presume working on someone code and the lines showing appear scattered across a number of best guess as to the code intent is that this is a mechanism to deal with it is common in to use libraries with your own if those libraries need to temporarily hold data that you created and you need a way to give the library access to your data even though the library know about your one example is a if a library will asynchronously notify you when an event you need to give it a function pointer and also data so that when the function is you know what to do with libraries commonly take a pointer for this it is common in to just pass in an object instance for the data and then delegate to that object to handle the what the code would look library void user ptr do something with myclass new the callback is now armed with all the data it libraries accomplish this by declaring this is a raw pointer to some memory anything could be at that an a class a the library holds onto that pointer and returns it back to your code at some 3rd line of your example code is taking the pointer and casting it to a reference to a class references are like pointers except they cannot be null and they use value syntax the operator instead of the for the 4th line of your example code then uses a method on the class if all 4 lines of code are consecutive in the code base dealing that code means that ignorant of a more compact way to do the same code in one if you prefer value

 has always been the behavior as how else will the compiler build your project if it does not have a reference to all the assemblies that are referenced by your project are required for your application to you are using types from those assemblies and without those types your application cannot more importantly without those types your application cannot consider that every assembly that you reference was built in the same manner as your assembly and requires that all referenced assemblies be present and accounted this does create a chain reaction that can be annoying but the end result is that once you are executing your the clr has all the assemblies that it needs to run your

 have a situation where my xslt files should display prices alongwith decimals depending on whether the input xml contains decimals or i can receive xml files with two types of values xml will contain all prices formatted with decimals upto two places call this one or the prices will be rounded off to the nearest integer call this one problem is that i need to refactor as little as possible in the xslt files and yet allow them to apply the transformation to xhtml in the same format as the xml in order to accomplish i implemented and suggested three guidelines to my all function calls when the value is being computed for calculations or stored in a use certain conditions apply to this rule the value is to be use the this should ensure that integer or decimal values will be displayed as originally present in the optional tags as use the function even if the value is only being this is necessary because if the tag is trying to obtain a value will give an is a illustrative example of the works for but values in rendered upto 14 decimal even though shows it correctly in the debugger in i cannot figure out special about the error works same as the above works for but values in are rendered with decimal works for but some values in rendered for is rendered as is rendered as 95 the html comments it works in most cases but not would like to use a single expression to format all prices same as the rather than applying constructs everywhere which would additionally require a boolean parameter passed to the xslt to determine the display the present state of the xslt is that all numbers are rounded off regardless of the using do i accomplish after i decided to create a sample xml the xslt so the experts can try it out xml one contains decimal formatting based on input

 have a wrapper project i created to talk to a 3rd party another lets call it it uses this api by adding the wrapper project as a project reference so that it can use various classes to call api methods via httprequest i need to do a bulk update by calling a wrapper class called and loop through each of the records in our database and using some of the fields from each of those records make an api call to update each is i want to create like a in my wrapper problem is that it would have to take a generic list of objects into the this generic list of objects records pulling from our the resides in since it represents the table and instance of each record for that table in my if i send a generic list of those objects to my class that does the looping and sending of the request to update all those records in the generic just introduced a circular reference because is referencing and then is referencing a class in because taking in a list of generic object instances that represent records in our i guess how is the best way to keep a circular reference from i guess i could instead create the bulkupdate logic in and that jsut referencing the and doing the loop in some class i create in and only using the class from our wrapper project and not sending any of the mybusinesslayer classes to that wrapper hope this makes circular

 have created a assembly that is exposed to com according to the exceptional article and deploy a com by phil everything works fine in the sense that the assembly is properly registered for and compiled com code can call it without any only odd thing is that developing against the assembly when using vb or vba requires that the programmer to the exact file location of the associated after which everything works just that the class library is not showing up directly within the references dialog so you must browse to the file the com interop aspects do work i would think that there must be some setting that would make the library directly visible within the references dialog for vb and anyone know what this setting would or should this be happening automatically for me just by having it thanks in advance for any answer question about whether using the using a setup and not explicitly using the assembly is being correctly which can be seen by the fact that within the key correctly holds the full path to the compiled com components execute against this dll just only when developing against it using vb or vba that they do not appear within the references dialog i therefore need to to the correct file after which it works further it appears although the class guids are being registered my file is not being i have no idea why registering the file should put some registry entries for the interface on which my class is based at but this is not strange that this lack of registration does not seem to affect the ability to other than its discoverability within and references properties for my file within the setup project do seem to be the property is set to and the property is set to i am puzzled as to why this would not be successfully installed on the target it turns out that the setup project is being built despite it reporting that the is actually a build warning a not an being reported that it as to create registration information for file name since this was a and not an the compile was stating and the error list was opening this it seems that this can be an issue when attempting to create a setup project when vista is your development as described typelib registration problem in vs2008 setup is a somewhat manual fix described unable to create registration information for file named have not tried the fix but i will tomorrow and report back if this solves did not work out so it seems that running as suggested in that article does not work when running on since regcap is actually run internally by the setup project itself on creating the this is not terribly in the setup project was almost certainly failing because the regcap command that it was calling was so calling regcap directly is of no bottom line is that this is simply a bug when attempting to create a setup package on perhaps it is a combination of visual studio 2008 and not attempting the same exact approach is to create a setup project on visual studio 2005 running on windows xp had absolutely no problems very well may be fixes to get this running right on vista visual studio but i could not track it much more efficient for me was to build using visual studio 2005 on windows xp to generate the com registration and then to import them into my visual studio 2008 setup these can be exported as files via regasm using a switch against the dll and using regcap on against the since my com interfaces will not be i only have to do this this issue in visual studio 2008 when running on vista will be corrected at some but if hopefully this post will be of some value to someone else who finds him or herself in the same to get com server for excel written in installed and registered in automation servers add a project to the vb6 references

 have created an iphone app where you start in a navcontroller and after a couple of levels you select an option from the table and an animated view pops in that has a tabbarcontroller at its is a completely seperate view that replaces the you tab around and when you want to go back to the options screen you press back and another animated transition plays swapping back the navigation controller removing the tab bar controller and releasing problem comes with releasing the if you press the tab buttons to switch between tabs it seems you continually increase the reference count for the view then when you call release on the tabbarcontroller reference it will only release the view controller of the selected tab or any tabs you viewed and it takes one of the retain count on the others tabs this means you leak all your model custom cell objects etc from each of the other tabs that were not an example of what i am if you create a new template tabbarcontroller project in xcode and add a viewwillappear method to the first view controller that prints out the retain count for start the app and press back and forth on the first and second tab buttons and watch the log the retain count just keeps i am wondering if there is a way to release a tab bar controller and have it release all of its view controllers at the same for view controllers in tabbarcontroller releasing a

 have done this trie in c with 8 bit and simply used the array version alluded to by the i am guessing that you want full unicode support a char is among other assuming you have to have support for the lookup is probably your best as a 64k entry array in each node really work very the only hack up i could think of on this is to store entire strings or possibly on branches that do not yet depending on how sparse the that adds a lot of logic to detect the and to split them up when an alternate path is is the read vs update update jul 2013 strings have a function like java to get the bytes for a string then having an array in each node to represent the current byte value is probably a good way to you could even make the arrays variable with bounds indicators in each since many nodes will have only lower case ascii letters or only upper case letters or the digits in some

 have found that one of the best investments i ever made in avoiding deadlocks was to use a object relational mapper that could order database the exact order is not as long as every transaction writes in the same order deletes in exactly the reverse reason that this avoids most deadlocks out of the box is that your operations are table a then table then table c perhaps depends on table can achieve a similar result as long as you exercise care in your stored procedures or data access the only problem is that it requires care to do it by whereas a orm with a unit of work concept can automate most a delete should run forward to verify that everything is the version you expect still need record version numbers or and then delete backwards once everything as this should all happen in one the possibility of something changing out from under you the only reason for the orm doing it backwards is to obey the key but if you do your check you will have all the locks you need already in

 have the following bit of code that i have used in the past to export a dataset generated from the stored procedure to dim c as long for each dc as datacolumn in c dim i as long for each dr as datarow in c for each dc as datacolumn in c i am trying to this code an different but similar i am running into an the previous use of this code was used on a static table in our dbase generated by the stored and while this basically remains the same for the new the requirements now require the stored procedure to have an input parameter to be entered by the user prior to for a little you can follow that completed process here a parameter into stored application itself does in fact return a fully populated and like our users to have the ability to export that generated dataset to i set up your prototypical button to do start the dirty raising the excel opens and my column names are being reiterated throughout the and here is the the cells representing the row data are have come to the conclusion do admit that i may be wrong in this that the rows are not being populated due to the fact that the stored procedure needs an input parameter to do and without that parameter there any data to return for each basically meaning that my code just work for what i am trying to i am right in my any ideas as to how i might get that parameter into my code above so that the rows will be properly i am any input on what be wrong with my logic or the code itself would be greatly is the code that generates the dim fbconn as dim myconnectionstring as myconnectionstring myserver mypassword fbconn new dim fbcmd as new dim fbadapter as new dim dsresult as new dim recordcount as recordcount catch ex as was an error in generating the check the system credentials and try the problem please contact your friendly it end kindly suggests that i offer a bounty to anyone answering my since i have enough rep to create a sufficient bounty does my gratitude garner any coding few quick tested my application by altering the stored procedure to inject the results into a new separate and then run my excel export against that table and it works since many people will be using the application at the same this is not a viable i am back to believing that there is an issue with this instance of the dataset needing a parameter to run correctly for the to answer any and all questions to the best of my dataset to

 have to disagree with nick on the notion of values ending up in the url in there is no try query string parameters can supply the model values with either difference which is possibly significant is that when passing id and name as those are the only two fields which can ever be when passing a person as an potentially other fields could be this may or may not be what you but updatemodel will accept a whitelist of properties like it to update similarly for binding a person instance in an so long as you remember to consider including a there is no real difference me the biggest difference between the two options you show is who is instantiating the person when you pass id and name as it will always be your controller code which instantiates the when you pass a person as an it will always be the model binder which instantiates the this could be significant rather than instantiating a new person you would like to materialize an existing instance from a

 have two processes which exange messages each a is a normal program which sends messages to process b is a qt gui application showing received messages into a text created a customized widget which inherits from qplaintextedit and reads messages from a pipe when a timer and appends them in the text is not really designed like this would be pretty bad design i but just to make things simple reasons i process a cannot be shut down while creating the form using is that while using qt designer selecting the showmessages widget and putting it within the the widget begins to show even if in the this feature is cool but the problem is that when i save the already present messages are saved in which results in turn in bad behaviour when i start process b process starts showing messages i received during the creation could clean the text box just after process b but i think that avoiding messages to be present in the file is much what i want is to be able to write code like this for the not in the timer there an qt function to know if in the do you think that distinguishing between designer and runtime code is for but english is not my primary between designer and runtime

 have used it but just for research use it only if you are sure about the cpu architecture of your deployment environment wont let me tell you jit compilation is not too bad and if you have deployments across multiple cpu environments example a windows client application which is updated then do not use thats coz a valid ngen cache depends upon many if one of these your assembly falls back to jit is a clear winner in such as it optimizes code on the fly based on the cpu architecture its running eg it can detect if there are more then 1 clr is getting better with every so in short stick with jit unless you are dead sure of your deployment environment even then your performance gains would hardly justify using gains would be in few hundred imho its not worth the check this real nice link on this topic compilation and performance to ngen or not to

 have used subsonic on a number of my projects and would argue that subsonic scales exceptionally subsonic like most technologies can be used for good or say for example you have some table on a page with a gazillion columns and gobs of you could write a stored procedure to get the data creates wrappers around all of your stored you could create a view in the database so that if your db is smart it can optimize the views performance creates a class for each of your views as well as say you use a view and want any of the overhead of a collection of with subsonic you can just get an idatareader for your that fast enough for you i know what the other hand lets say in the same app you also have 5 or so tables with only columns and 10 or so rows used for administration and you can now use one of subsonics nifty controls the scaffold which will create a gridview with built in functionality for the table by just dropping it on the has a lot of time saving functionality built into it and when you want to do it your now and then we all say my way or the high subsonic will allow you to do it your

 having any knowledge at all of but going by the bit meaning that this warning is applicable to more than i would suggest that this means be wary of standard libraries in general as they may peform things that work in a udf example back to strtok maintains a local state between calls meaning you have to serialize its use or face corruption of its results if you tried to use it to work on two different strings at the same thus strtok would not work in an environment like a udf where you have no control as to where and when the function is i would say that anything that would not work in a multithreaded environment should be note that the above is based purely on my and is not based in

 having trouble designing a good architecture for a particular portion of my especially where maintaining state is have a group of parsing class reads in a block of data into a buffer and handles the overall control class takes the block of data in the buffer and a and divides it up into smaller chunks for the to is an interface that i am trying to i think i want to do something like this represents some data structure containing various bits of state that will include a bytebuffer holding the entire block of raw represents information including the position of each chunk within the and any other information the has determined about the void void chunkmetadata void will call to let it set up any state at the beginning of a and is committed to leaving a designated portion of the blockinfo constant until it makes a matching call to afterwards it might reuse the data buffer for the next runs through the data block and splits it into chunks according to a predefined data and will call multiple once for each one reason for the contract to include a buffer that remains is so that can copy the whole block of data at the beginning or and have to reassemble the chunks into the one block when they were there together all the a division of is just responsible for managing the overall routine and reading in the it care less about anything is the thing that splits the data block into chunks and it care less about what to do with them or how the data got is the interface trying to design so that concrete classes can implement it and work without or caring what it or without it caring about how to divide up the block into chunks or where the data came question should the burden on maintaining any state be on the class implementing and kept out of and if the semantics of my interface include the fact that the raw data block in blockinfo will not change between calls of and should i then only pass it in to and not to the other or is it okay to send it along for there a better design pattern to handle a situation like interface how to handle stateful

 here with bad news for so i hope you can take some constructive and i applaud what trying to spreadsheets are great for simple for playing with the and as a platform for data to on the other using spreadsheets as a form of or even data storage is a terrible idea for a myriad of technical and social reasons that your employers not care need to face one truth there is nothing you can do to make them care about these if easy better or flexibility were important to them they even have their current you need to change your and the first step to doing it is abandoning your hopes for a moment where their faces light up and they just if telling them that the change is necessary and trusting you on that fact if then all you no different than trusting your mechanic when he says you need a new part installed in your are you happy about the of course the work doing and the subsequent retraining an address the other half of your you want them to be more more in providing you with their regarding a new you want them to about what they need and how they and provide you with ideas about have bad news they and mostly because they truth the hardest part of most systems is the not the and the hardest part of most designs is the design is hard job requiring special knowledge and skill not treat design as the byproduct of the other way learn that well and learn it almost anyone can learn to hack some code always felt my business card should say software of it this you hire a home decorator to come in and spruce up your living so the decorator comes in and starts grilling you for ideas on what you want the place to look would that work you knew how to make your place look if had the why would you need the home good decorator would observe your living arrangement and how your carry about your daily business at he or she would make note of the way currently thus learning your general without your direct the decorator would put together an overall and only then would the decorator ask for customer need to do the exact same for you know they like the what do we know about for data very responsive waiting they provide a very simple mental model through which to understand the they require no logins or other a spreadsheet gets out of the way and lets the person new i would is going to have a web interface far less will require authentication of some sort have to remember a password will lag in response other your new system will remove everything they about the current you have to win them over in other so figure out what them about and how you can avoid that in your figure out what data they have to manually enter into this log that you can automatically derive and enter in the new other going to make some things harder on them with the new unavoidable and you be in denial about your system will be better organized and well keeping your room tidy or letting it go to with that reality in find every single part of their tasks that you can optimize out so that your new system is a if you do lose the grousing within a week or two and come to like the new my as someone built a career on doing exactly what coming into a small business and replacing system and outdated software systems with my own

 his excellent clr via jeffrey richter said that he like and recommends not to use he gave some but i really can anyone explain to me why i should or should not use with automatic does this a i added jeffrey a property may be or field access is always readable and you define a it is best to offer both get and set accessor a property method may throw an field access never throws an a property cannot be passed as an out or ref parameter to a a field the following code will not sealed class private static string name get return set static void string n public static void for the line of code the compiler emits the error a property or indexer may be passed as an out or ref a property method can take a long time to field access always completes common reason to use properties is to perform thread stop the thread and a property should not be used if thread in that a method is if your class can remotely your class is derived from the property method will be very and a method is preferred to in my classes derived from marshalbyrefobject should never if called multiple times in a a property method may return a different value a field returns the same value each the class has a property that returns the current date and each time you query it will return a different this is a and microsoft wishes that fix the class by making now a method instead of a a property method may cause observable side field access never in a user of a type should be able to set various properties defined by a type in he or she chooses without noticing any different behavior in the a property method may require additional memory or return a reference to is not actually part of the so modifying the returned object has on the original querying a field always returns a reference to an object guaranteed to be part of the original working with a property a copy can be very confusing to and this characteristic is should i avoid using properties in

 how you do you create an object is that contains the form fields you wish to have the user fill in for your you create your form as a it should have bindings that work against your then you create a window that is set up so that the user can enter values for those the poco old clr to the textboxes in the after the user has entered the form take your now object and set it as the datacontext of the create an xpswriter and write your fixeddocument to your output give you but since actually doing this something relatively for work i think i i can tell you that the hardest part is dealing with the xps you can judge relative to your experiences

 http header is set by the user and not by the not sure that there is anything you can do to ensure that you get a referer	
 http server uses to serve a single url or based on the say we have a proxy cache like squid between clients and the the proxy has cached both encodings of a how does it determine which to instance originally served with can be served to any but the encoded instances can only be sent to a clients with the identical header value as was used in the original opera sends but ie8 sends according to the caches share caches between the two is this do http proxy caches decide between serving

 i agree with most of the response so far about pair programming being a good i will play advocate and argue that it always make you pair you get a programmer got twice the you get a programmer the of both of your so basically any time that i screw up and my partner catches or finds some way a any time that i write the correct code on my own is a waste of money since my partner you need to evaluate the code working simple tasks are usually not worth the money to pay someone to sit over shoulder and make sure you wrote your for loop at some the tasks are complicated enough to make the roi for pair programming

 i believe it if you follow the practice this may be impractical for a large program written in c because of the degree of manual labour this may but in a more modern language most of this work is done for you because an out of memory condition results in a thrown benefits of doing this consistently are that the program will not enter an undefined state due to the out of memory condition resulting in a buffer overrun obviously leaves the possibility of an undefined state due to an early exit to the although this is a different class of having done your program can consistently handle the error or if the failure was a critical decide to quit in a graceful	
 i believe that is what talking i believe the problem to be the iframe and not the combination of the draggable and i have this same issue and it also manifested itself with a prior implementation using the prototype implementation uses an iframe as a canvas on which to drop the way you can see the bug is to move your mouse too fast so that the cursor leaves the edge of the draggable the div stops moving and your mouse keeps by moving your mouse back to the surface of the it picks up the div again and starts moving even if released the click on your suspicion is that the iframe events somehow interfere with the jquery solution was to position a transparent div tag between the iframe and the this the iframe never sees the mouse movement and as such see code i revisited this issue and the iframefix seems to work great in all browsers for the but the resizables do not have the equivalent used this code to manually add a mask it as a mask over the iframe to prevent ie from stealing mouse mask when dragging the is a 1x1 pixel transparent fixes the issue for ie7 ie6 has trouble with and seem to figure out that the div should be between the iframe and the resizable i gave up on

 i have a number of related classes that all have a method like override type of may change may also be a and the specific property will certainly but the type of the property will always be further that decided silly to have 8 different classes that all do the exact same thing on an implementation toggle a bool especially when all related on a semantic level also all derive from the same abstract base which is where comes to i parameterize the property that i want to toggle without parameterizing the actual toggle operation for i know i can do something like this class action doexecute public protected override b new how i can i capture the toggling behavior in the while still accepting the writable property as a i pass the toggling in as a then just making an just pass the property in is a value so just be toggling a i pass it in by of properties be passed by i feel like got to be something stupid and obvious that just really missing reason doing such a simple thing in an indirect manner is actually due to the use of the gof command pattern in the core functionality are more but this small subset of essentially just toggles a property that will raise propertychanged events instead of having all these commands in separate i wanted to fold them into one because so do i refactor multiple similar methods of this sort into a single

 i have summed up what you need to do when implementing iequatable and provided the justification from the various msdn documentation testing for value equality is desired as when using objects in you should implement the iequatable override and gethashcode for your testing for reference equality is desired you should use and should only override and for and immutable reference interface is used to compare two instances of an object for the objects are compared based on the logic implemented in the the comparison results in a boolean value indicating if the objects are this is in contrast to the which return an integer indicating how the object values are iequatable interface declares two methods that must be the equals method contains the implementation to perform the actual comparison and return true if the object values are or false if they are the gethashcode method should return a unique hash value that may be used to uniquely identify identical objects that contain different the type of hashing algorithm used is should implement iequatable for your objects to handle the possibility that they will be stored in an array or generic you implement iequatable you should also override the base class implementations of and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the for overriding and operator programming returns returns the same value as returns then returns invocations of equals return the same value as long as the objects referenced by x and y are not equals returns false value types for more see types programming new implementation of equals should not throw is recommended that any class that overrides equals also override is recommended that in addition to implementing any class also implement for their own to enhance the operator tests for reference equality by determining whether two references indicate the same reference types do not have to implement operator in order to gain this when a type is that the data that is contained in the instance cannot be overloading operator to compare value equality instead of reference equality can be useful as immutable they can be considered the same as long as they have the same is not a good idea to override operator in operator implementations should not throw type that overloads operator should also overload operator operator predefined value the equality operator returns true if the values of its operands are false reference types other than returns true if its two operands refer to the same the string compares the values of the testing for null using comparisons within your make sure you use the base object class if you infinite recursion will occur resulting in a method your programming language supports operator overloading and if you choose to overload the equality operator for a given that type must override the equals such implementations of the equals method must return the same results as the equality following guidelines are for implementing a overriding equals to gain increased performance over that provided by the default implementation of equals on you override equals and the language supports operator you must overload the equality operator for your value following guidelines are for implementing a overriding equals on a reference type if the semantics of the type are based on the fact that the type represents some reference types must not overload the equality even if they override if you are implementing a reference type that is intended to have value such as a complex number you must override the equality overriding make sure you test reference types for null before using them in the hash ran into a problem with programming and operator overloading described

 i have the static void static void java static bytebuffer int int try return new catch throw new question is how come funcb does not need to do a block around this java api method that throws an funcb compiles fine without a i believe the answer has to do with the fact that the java api method throws an exception but is not declared as next question is when i change funcb to throws how come funca need to catch thrown does the compiler dig deep and realize that declared as throws so all callers actually need to catch anything even in this actually are declared as throws if that was confusing or hard to the exception chaining

 i incorrectly assumed it had to do with sql it appears actually a php related to you trying to print out array elements that all of your prints that include elements of you need to make sure that there are actually columns named that being returned by your if not a column named that attempt to print it is going to generate the since this got bumped i guess go into a little more of as bobince points you have sql injection the first line should will always be an and if it could be a is generally bad especially in a case with i know exactly which tables particular fields come but your query should look more like where you select only the fields actually going to updates join clients on join pages on join projects on gets set to exactly the same value as already so kind of a pointless on the last you echo not sure what expecting this to but going to assign to and then end up printing out or or probably not what you were going you both try to select from and join you do at least without giving one of them an

 i just clarify you want to put your machine into german mode to test your web which just happens to be running on the same machine as the this is running for real can we assume that the sever could be hosted outside germany maybe in germany but on a machine set up with a us locale it happens a if so setting the culture on the server really what you and you probably be able to do that when you deploy also have another there is no way you can detect which culture your user wants to you can detect all sorts of info from the http do a domain lookup on the ip but what if a german speaker wanted to use your site from the or an american was in germany and wanted to see and not for the decimal put it another i am saying it matter what culture your pc is using it is not relevant because once you go over the web all bets are off even if your app did detect your culture correctly it might not be what your user the way i would do this is to ask the user what language they want and then explicitly set the locale in your application at run this does mean asking the user to pick a langague but the only way to be sure of using the right locale for the if all your users are german then you have to you can just hard code if his approach sounds like it might work then some good sample code or rather viel

 i needed to compare a suggested pattern for idisposable and object finalization with the one we which we have used the one a fair but after looking it the two side by side i had a number of questions about the here is the class implements private disposedvalue as boolean false to detect redundant protected overridable sub disposing as if not if disposing free managed resources when explicitly end free shared unmanaged end end idisposable support this code added by visual basic to correctly implement the disposable public sub implements do not change this put cleanup code in disposing as end is called during gc without being explicitly called first then and the code within will never execute to free the managed in them remaining in memory until the next gc why these be explicitly doing so free more memory on the first gc pass and not leave unneeded objects in memory until the next the ide generate the call when overriding on an idisposable would the gc know to call and ensure that it is the implementation and not a custom implementation which uses the bool parameter in a different as be an interface member if the gc tests for its existence and uses it in a manner that assumes a certain implementation in the presence of both and as why would the gc ever opt to call the i am confused by the supposed added value of having an extended that executes when is called opposed to having a common path that is executed regardless of whether or not was called while i can appreciate that it is provided with good intentions i see how it does anything other than delay the actual release of managed resources if called in essence it seems to only work to make the managed resources unreachable in the object orphaning them until the 2nd gc run rather than freeing them at a point where they are known to be no longer does implement the idisposable interface with a as

 i pointed out in to implement incremental search on a you should use structures like a or for searching patterns in large for discovering patterns in the middle of some text there is one simple i am not sure if it is the most efficent but i usually do it as i insert some new text into the i just insert then remove the first insert remove the second insert again and so on until the whole text is then you can discover every substring of every inserted text by just one search from the that resulting structure is called a and there are a lot of optimizations it is really incredible to find all texts that contain a given sequence of n characters you have to inspect at most n nodes and perform a search on the list of children for every depending on the implementation binary of the child node you might be able to identify the required child node with as few as 5 search steps assuming case insensitive latin letters interpolation sort might be helpful for large alphabets and nodes with many childs as those usually found near the

 i think coding up fractals makes a great sized it has some nice features this generally you require much 3rd party they can be implemented in a reasonably short amount of time and you get something nice too look at in the end which also verifies your there are loads of basic issues in both mathematics and the implementation of numerical algorithms that you will bump into if you do something as simple as a basic mandelbrot set generator you can branch out into all sorts of issues as commenters have even sticking with just you can learn about optimization techniques is my generator so and numerical issues i zoom past but also if you want to a bit of color theory space and other bits and

 i think the largest hurdle learning so much as gaining experience in writing commercial windows software and web could argue that good development practices are and only can really be acquired through experience in actually developing a project that being my best advice would be to start learning and practicing object oriented design patterns and practices and then applying them to a specific designing and maintaining an website for would help you to experience the intricacies of developing with also give you insight into how to and interact with key operating systems such as you may quickly find is that mastery of in isolation for to build a half decent website you are likely going to have to also understand something of databases an alternative for data reading blogs and msdn articles can be very but usually applicable to the current flavours of the establish a specific goal to achieve and go about researching designs and strategies to implement check out some of the patterns and practices it covers a wide range of topics many of which include design patterns and strategies which may be helpful as you learn the there are also a lot of projects to be found on and take code project with a grain of

 i think we all agree that what happens with the following code is depending on what is pointer could be all sorts of different and so performing an unconditional on it is assume that we are indeed passing an array arr new return question in this case where the pointer an who is it that knows i from the point of it has no idea whether or not is an array pointer versus a pointer to a single it even know whether was dynamically if i do the following num new return os is smart enough to only delete one int and not go on some type of by deleting the rest of the memory beyond that point that with and a string it will keep going until it hits whose job is it to remember these does the os keep some type of record in the i realise that i started this post by saying that what happens is but the fact the scenario so therefore in the practical world is does know an	
 i think we are all guilty of forgetting just who it is that we develop our applications it always easy as a developer to be able to take a step back and have a look at your application as a user might do this is why big companies employee hundreds of people to do this for them and they always get it is a massive subject but it is defiantly something that all developers need to keep in it has taken me a long time to learn this but when tackling any development task i always try to think about how my users are going to interact with what i am this will make a difference to all levels of your would suggest reading make me think by steve this book take you an age to read and it puts across some fantastic ideas that can help you to develop applications that are much easier to use and always find that once i have thought about the user experience the decisions about what my web pages are going to do and how they are going to interact are much easier to

 i understand the you are running into the problem where your local changes to keep getting checked into source so if you setup the compilation node for debugging in then check it the change will affect other is one of the more annoying things about web the technique i use is to just beat the crap out of any of my developers that check in local settings to one technique that used before is to just limit permissions in source control so that only a master admin account can check in changes to developers have rights to change that particular file in source devs manually remove the flag for their local copy of so they can make any necessary changes for their environments debug but they cannot check in those changes by accident to source a change is really needed to the file then we have to log in with the master admin account to make the

 id uniquely identifies an element within the entire whereas a class name is like a many tags can be added to an and the tags can be a comparison can add multiple class names to an element separated by but you can only add a single can a class name on multiple but can use an id only once within an entire id can be used as a fragment identifier on the and the browser will scroll to that for it is not possible to do this with id makes it much easy and efficient to find a particular element in for in note that libraries like jquery make it possible to find elements by their class name but not nearly as properties of is possible for an element to contain both an id and a number of class and it or mean if the id is the same as one of the class iframes and traditional popup windows count as separate so it is possible to use the same id on elements within these different browsers do not follow the specification and allow for the same id to be used multiple and for it to behave in some ways like a class name but still work in for a css selector based on that id may match multiple elements as if it were a this is a really messy situation and you should never rely on be happy if browsers stopped trying to support

 if only interested in the highest n occurring one way to do it is in two with the first pass based on a modified instead of using a bit map to track hash use an integer array instead either 16 32 bit or even 64 bit depending on your input where a bloom filter simply sets the bit corresponding to each of the hash values of a increment the count at the hash index in the problem with this approach is that two words will probably give the same hash so you need to do a second pass where you ignore words unless their hash totals are above a certain thus reducing the amount of memory you need to allocate to do accurate just create a bit map with bits set for the highest occurring hash then in the second pass of the if a word has in the bitmap for its look it up or add it to a hash table and increment its this minimises memory usage by creating a hash table of only the highest occurring

 imageurl for this control stored in a separate it works great for profile rather than an why not a generic handler they are a little more lightweight than an just search generic and find a number of basically the code you have now behind your but without all the page want the photos to be stored in a thumbnail grid when the user clicks on the it should bring up the photo on a separate i would think any repeatable control that supports templating of the item element as listview in should do the trick for you just set the image or height and width as appropriate for your wrap which ever tag you use in an html anchor with an href to your page that displays the image at

 implementations can differ in the way they implement jit garbage platforms version of java they all must meet set of features and behaviors so that it will execute your java bytecodes pointed the major difference tends to be in other differences tend to be in support integration with other technologies j2ee and access to source while a j2ee server runs on the some servers have integrated tools for and tweaking jvm far as technical those have grown less significant over the once upon a the ibm and jrockit had far superior performance to the reference sun this was due to significant differences in the types of runtime differences in garbage and differences in how much native code various classes these performance differences as significant also include or integrate with diagnostics and monitoring jrockit includes a set of tools for monitoring your jvm sun provides various tools with overlapping features to do the ibm websphere once upon a time included a similar set of tools for their whole j2ee application server sure if they still but i would assume still of the open source tend to have a little slower performance because they have been redeveloped from the ground as got a bit more catching up to last i checked about 2 years blackdown was significantly slower than the sun it was also a bit behind of supported versions of

 implemented a system in that uses the microsoft message queue for communication between related a number of services generate messages to put in the queue and a number of processes watch the queues and grab those messages when they just been told that there are some messages that will need priority over are likely to come in and there could potentially be occasions where a very large number of messages are put in the queue in one hit a thousand or so there could be a delay before the final message gets original thought was to have a second message queue which is also watched by each of the processes in a different be far fewer messages in this queue so be less i stumbled across the i use this priority flag rather than implementing another will it successfully and efficiently jump these messages ahead of the if what conditions and side effects are there likely to be if should i stick with my original plan and implement another queue for priority message queue priority flag or a separate

 implementing constraints that simply call a clr function for each constrained clr function is one or two lines of code that attempts to construct an instance of the data class associated with that for a class has a constructor which throws a meaningful error message when construction fails when the score is outside a valid what do you think of that for it centralizes my data types in making them available throughout my while also enforcing the same constraints within the so it prevents invalid manual edits in management studio that may try to working well so although updating the assembly causes constraints to be requiring a recheck of all constraints is perfectly i use checkconstraints with to make sure the data in all tables is still valid for enabled and disabled making corrections as until there are no then i the constraints on all the tables via table with check check constraint there a statement to with check all check constraints on all or do i have to them table by for the clr functions used in the check i can a in each function to catch data construction returning false on and true on so that the clr raise an error in the database out the just construct the instance and return allowing that aforementioned error message to be raised in the database prefer because my functions are simpler without the error and when someone using management studio makes an invalid column get the meaningful message from the clr like for type x match regular expression instead of some generic sql error like there any severe negative consequences of allowing clr errors through to sql or is it just like any other failure resulting from a constraint on implementing check constraints with sql clr

 in many issues related to programming it all find that one really should first try to define your api so exceptional cases can not happen in the first design by contract can help in doing here one would insert functions that throw an error or crash and indicate a programming error user some cases these checks are removed in release keep you exceptions for generic failures that can not be avoided db connection optimistic transaction disk write exceptions should then typically not need to be caught until they reach the and will result in the user to need to try the error is a user error like a typo in a name or something then deal with that directly in the application interface code since this is then a common error it would need to be handle with a user friendly error message potentially translated layering is also useful so lets take the example of transfering cash from one account an other int int double amount this is an internal function we require the client to provide us valid arguments error handling done design by contract argument amount do the actual transfer int int double amount start string if msg return common checking code used from multiple if msg return if amount return amount this could fail with an exception if someone else changed the balance while this transaction was unlikely but return transfer

 in the process of reviewing a code base and trying to determine how to migrating it from to not an overnight project and the suggestion which i have received is to write new code against java 5 and migrate the old code in a no expert in the new features in java 5 i know of but have never written any for production features of java 5 are typically used in production are there features to be avoided not considered to be are the best refactoring strategies which i can use migrate a code base of this make changes to classes one at a time only when a class is objective reduce risk on the code limitation resources to do advice is appreciated thanks in a year too but better late than you for all of the comments lots of great points of in the life of a software always going to be the projects you strive to finish but never get around to because of something more respect to the use of java 5 that it was something which was required in the production so that was why we did not use java found that the stronger typing for enums and unboxing of primitives were the features i tend to apply the both to old and new the refactoring was fairly but code comprehension improved significantly and standards became easier to the ones i had the most trouble with was the i think a concept which i still had a chance to fully grasp and appreciate so it was difficult for me to find previous cases where the application of generics was again to everyone who contributed to this thread and apologies for the late follow for migrating code base from java to java

 internationalizing a python with two goals in application loads classes from multiple each with its own i18n so modules in package a are using domain modules in package b are using domain locale can be changed while the application is module makes internationalizing a application very you just set the then call which finds the right and installs its method in the global namespace as but obviously a global value only works for a single and since it loads a single it only works for that could instead load the at the top of each and bind its ugettext method as then each module would be using the for its own but this still breaks when the locale is because is for the wrong i guess i could load the correct at the top of every but that seems awfully an alternative would be to still do it but instead of binding i would substitute my own which would check the current get its and forward the string to does anyone have a cleaner is the best way to internationalize a python app with multiple i18n

 investigating an issue with application working came across one behavior i quite it seems that when you have a textbox with bound text property the system takes one more layout pass than when you have a static explain why this extra pass is does the engine lay the unbound control first then binds it and then lays it once test this built such test declared a class inherited from textbox i can override class multiboundtextbox protected override size return i placed an instance of this text box in a added some code for the window for public private void routedeventargs protected override size return private void eventargs when i run this i get this if i change text property to be bound like get this in the the extra pair of and why is this extra pass and layout relation in

 iphone has 16gb 8 or depending on the of flash memory that persists even when the power is turned it also has 128mb of volatile dram that gets lost when the power is turned the differences memory is dram is memory is dram is memory is dram is flash memory is essentially like a hard except a not a rotating platter of magnetic in iphone when talking about talking about dram is a more limited resource and more likely to run since very easy for an app do eat up megabytes by poor memory a lot harder to run out of flash since doing so would involve writing very large files into the file

 is a api for heirarchical data such as xml which has been standardized by the it is a rich api with much it is object in that each node is an is good when you not only want to or but you want to do a lot of manipulation of nodes an existing such as inserting nodes between changing the is a api which is also but is intended to be a lot less than the simple tasks such as finding the value of a node or finding its child elements take a lot less its api is not as rich than but it still includes features such as xpath and a basic ability to work with it still preserves all features of your document such as xml cdata sections and even though it include functions to manipulate is very good for if all you want to do is read the xml document and convert it to another then save you a lot of also fairly good when you want to generate a or do basic manipulations such as adding or changing child elements or but it can become complicated not to do a lot of manipulation of existing not for to add a child element in between two addchild only inserts after other simplexml also cannot do xslt it have things like or but if you know xpath you can still do that kind of thing with simplexmlelement object is somewhat the properties it exposes if you correspond to its complete internal it exposes some of its child elements as if they were properties which can be accessed with the but still preserves the full document and you can do things like access a child element whose name is a reserved word with the operator as if it was an associative have to fully commit to one or the because php implements the is helpful if you are using simplexml and need to work with code that expects a dom node or vice also offers a third xml implementation of a but not referred to by that name in the is a much lower level which serves quite a different it build objects for it basically just makes it easier to write your own xml because it does the job of advancing to the next and finding out the type of such as what tag name is and whether an opening or closing for then you have to write callbacks that should be run each time a token is all tasks such as representing the document as in a manipulating the etc will need to be implemented because all you can do with the xml parser is write a low level xml parser functions are still quite helpful if you have specific memory or speed with it is possible to write a parser that can parse a very long xml document without holding all of its contents in memory at if you not interested in all of the and need or want it to be put into a tree or set of php then it can be for if you want to scan through an xhtml document and find all the and you care about	
 is a app to learn how to program it uses these global functions that but they do very specific tasks as i this is a horrible example of what good code should there are other functions that just return the part looking rather than me just writing what you you can read full listing take care that you note down which must be within the mythical loop and which you can use it happens there are even more ways to get the but i was really imagining for this example you would do something i is the post id inside the loop though i could be as another poster says you can use a fairly simple function to grab the current loop brings me back to perhaps wanting to explain why learning programming from wordpress is a bad they have so many damned way of doing the same damned thing that almost impossible to keep on top of blog is a really simple set of data moreso in case because it fully but rather than just having one way to output a title echo you have umpteen all doing subtly different you really want to learn how to program of hacking your way around the crap that is the wp creating a simple blog engine is fairly quick and certainly how a lot of people get into a new language or if you want to have have a look at of the wordpress if fighting something like this in the future that have 100 ways of doing i really recommend it uses up a whole buttload of resources for something relatively easiest way can be as simple as just taking the source for the original sticking it in a new function and replacing the with note there may be some database connectivity to handle that returning prematurely may so if the echo the last instead of returning right store the string as a variable and return at the end of the

 is a c it takes a c source file and creates machine either in the form of unlinked object files or as an actual executable which has been linked to all object modules and is useful for controlling the build process of a a typical c program consists of several modules and header files it would be to always compile everything after you change so make is designed to only compile the parts that need to be after a does this by following rules created by the for cc rule tells make that the file depends on the files and and if either of them it can be built by running the command on the second above is not actual make wants the commands indented by a tab which i do in this editing imagine reads its rules from a file that is usually called a since these files are written by make has a lot of magic to let you shorten the for it knows that a can be built from a and it knows what the command to do so the above rule could be shortened to small program consisting of three modules might have a makefile like mycmd can do more than just compile a typical makefile will have a rule to clean out unwanted rm core rule might run diff makefile might run a tool to convert documentation from some markup language to html and for makefile might have an install rule to copy the binary program it builds to wherever the user or system administrator wants it so since make is generic and it is typically used to automate the whole process from unpacking a source tarball to the point where the software is ready to be used by the is a whole lot of to learn about make if you want to learn it the gnu version of make has particularly good has it in various	
 is a case of premature unoptimization you should never do something because you think it will be you has extra if you have no need of the extra features of arraylist then it is wasteful to use an for some of the things you can do with a list there is the arrays which means that the arraylist provided more functionality than arrays is less now using those might be slower than using an but it would have to be profiled to be should never try to make something faster without being sure that it is slow to begin which would imply that you should go ahead and use arraylist until you find out that they are a problem and slow the program however there should be common sense involved too arraylist has the overhead will be small but it will not be easy to spot in a as all it is is a little overhead and a little overhead so common sense would unless you need the features of arraylist you should not make use of unless you want to die by a thousands cuts internal if you find that you do need to change from arrays to arraylist the chance is pretty straight forward in most cases becomes that will be of the you are using the look value then there is no code to change for that as going with what you equal access depending on your for instance the android vm inline methods is just a straight interpreter as far as i so the access on that will be much there are other operations on an arraylist that can cause depends on what you are regardless of the vm could be faster with a stright again you would have to profile or examine the source to be wrappers increase the amount of memory being should not worry about before you profile on the other hand you choose what you know to be a slower option unless you have a good reason

 is a container format and this use of it too it has the advantage of being relatively human readable except for the html you could try using cdata sections for one advantage of using xml for this is that you could use a dtd to validate that all languages have translations present for all make sure you encode the file using or and it probably helps if you put the encoding at the top of the recommend for how you load the xml data and incorporate it into the i know but the overall approach sounds the only downside i can see is that you have to release all the translations simultaneously to avoid this thing i note is that you use ch as the language code for should use that is the iso code for ch is shiny and

 is a difficult i have changed my habit related to this question several times in the last so here are some thoughts coming to my mind the arguments in the constructor is like checking the arguments for a traditional so i would not differentiate the arguments of a method of course does help to ensure parameters passed are but also introduces a lot of more code you have to which not always pays off in my especially when you do write short methods which delegate quite frequently to other i guess you would end up with 50 of your code just doing parameter consider that very often when you write a unit test for your you want to have to pass in valid parameters for all quite often it does make sense to only pass those parameters important for the current test so having checks would slow you down in writing unit think this really depends on the what i ended up is to only write parameter checks when i know that the parameters do come from an external system user web or something like if data comes from my own i write tests most of the

 is a fairly large set of differences between these two technologies that cannot be really covered in a short so but try to cover the linq2sql you write your queries over in memory under the hood though the code you write is translated to expression trees and is further translated to sql at runtime where the query is actually in you directly build sql queries which are run against the has direct language support in and provides support for string based query which have 0 language support other than just a raw language support in linq2sql makes queries type in all query results must be converted to the appropriate type which essentially removes type safety

 is a primary concern through development when you have a good reason to expect that performance will be unfixably bad if optimization is a secondary depends a lot what kind of code but there are often better reasons to believe that your code will be unfixably difficult to or or full of or if all those things become secondary to tweaking managers of those things are our primary good managers work to find out which are dangers for this good design does have to consider all these and the earlier you have a estimate of any of the if all your manager is is that if you never think about how fast your code will run then too much of your code will be then i just say that makes optimization your the usp of your software is that faster than your then optimization is a primary with you can often predict what sorts of operations will be the design those with optimization in mind right from the and ignore optimization a lot of projects even need be fast enough without much provided you use sensible algorithms and do anything do anything is always a primary with no need to mention performance in

 is correct on some other reasons are that it cost effective and that there are additional security have different hardware requirements than database database servers fare better with a lot of memory and a really fast disk array while web servers only require enough memory to cache files and frequent db requests on your regarding cost the two servers necessarily be less however ratio should be higher since you have to different applications competing for for this probably going to have to spend a lot more for one server which caters to both and offers equivalent performance to 2 specialized security concern is that if the single machine is both webserver and database are with two you have some breathing room as the 2nd server will still be secure a while at there are some scalability benefits since you may only have to maintain a few database servers that are used by a bunch of different web this way you have less work to do applying upgrades or patches and doing performance i believe that there are server management tools for making these tasks easier though the single machine the the

 is essentially a problem that involves a number of discrete solutions to provide the full essentially there are 3 problems with sitting behind the advertised service endpoint of links to schemas that describe the data problem you the host as you have found solves 1 and 2 can approach this in ways other than host but no need to go into that number 3 is a bit more tricky and requires more code much to dump out short answer is that you need to write a contractbehavior that implements both icontractbehavior and important bit you need to implement is the within this method you need to iterate over all the wsdlport and when you find an extension that is of type soapaddressbinding you need to replace the property with a new uri that contains the https protocol you also need to do similar bits for the xsd import addresses and schema your service is also using you then need to do something similar to handle the additional addresses it writes out to the based the code i ended up writing on the wsdlextras project available on codeplex the method used in the wsdlextras provides a great base for any extra bits you may need to add to it memory i think it dealt with the the bit you want to look at is the soap address location

 is happening because the plugin binds the event handlers on page and you are then adding dynamic content to the page after the the easiest solution would be to move whatever code you have to instatiate the domwindow plugin into a function and call it once on page load and again whenever a new link is if it starts double binding the already existing then have to give the dynamic links a different class and instatiate the second time around for that seems to be some misunderstanding so explain jquery feature you are using for was designed to fix the problem that you are you probably already know this and hence you are using the above paragraph was because i believe what you are saying is that the domwindow link you are returning is not opening the domwindow as you might this is because domwindow does not use internally to bind the so when you initially instatiate domwindow on page the links get but the new ones if willing to edit the source code of the plugin you could directly fix this by simply using but it is easier not as to just move the code to a function and call it whenever adding more content to the

 is my code for service and data contracts up to the point satisfied that the web service interface exposes most of the functionality you want it to expose talking only about interface classes and data not the code so that you have the latest for the web wsdl and data contract xsd files using for will create a wsdl directory containing those definition you should add these files to your source since they are now the basis for developing and maintaining your web time you change the you have to regenerate the might need to specify some additional command line options for getting the code the way you like check the svcutil will probably want to throw away the old code the step since not really relevant any way you have the total control of the which means easier life for clients which use your web since there is less chance of some nasty surprises if wsdl generation engine changes in the future is almost certainly going to based on previous drawback is that you have to manually tweak wsdl

 is often the there seem to be one right answer for know what advantage there is to using the same element tag for the request and you for use and as separate that might be a bit more and would also strengthen the argument for using distinct namespaces for the two message if you have good reasons for using as the tag for both request and then you define a schema such that is a the union members would contain elements that are appropriate for either requests or but not this structure would make it easier to keep the two sides in the same if that seems like the right thing to be a little more inclined to go this route if i saw the request and response protocols as being tightly such that changes to one probably require changes to the other as if the types of information in the response set can change over time by then separate namespaces would make more

 is true for all negative there is one more negative number than there are positive numbers for twos complement is valid for one more case than n 0 solution that is the same same as got you by one it is not valid for one case more as i just recognized by comment will just overflow thought about using mod 2 but it does not work to if done it will work for all numbers except because this will played with it for a looking for a nice bit manipulation but i could not find a nice while the mod 2 solution fits in n this becomes the static int32 return 2 n n get it working for all you have to replace with and include the calculation in an then you get even mapped to itself as unchecked negation by another answer i am going to explain how the function works and how to construct such a start at the very the function is repeatedly applied to a given value yielding a sequence of n question demands that is two successive applications of negate the two further applications of four in total negate the argument again yielding n n there is a obvious cycle of length substituting and noting that the obtained equation yields the n x n we get a cycle of length four with two numbers and the two numbers if you imagine the cycle as a negated values are located at opposite of many solution to construct such a cycle is the following starting from n negate and subtract 1 add negate and add n 1 subtract concrete example is of such an cycle is we are almost noting that the constructed cycle contains an odd positive its even and both numbers we can easily partition the integers into many such cycles is a multiple of and have found a function that satisfies the we have a problem with the cycle must contain x because zero is negated to and because the cycle states already it follows x 0 this is only a cycle of length two and is turned into itself after two not into luckily there is one case that solves the if equals zero we obtain a cycle of length one containing only zero and we solved that problem concluding that zero is a fixed point of we have zero is a fixed point leaving and we must partition that number into cycles of four bad that is not a multiple of four there will remain three numbers not in any cycle of length will explain the remaining part of the solution using the smaller set of 3 bit signed itegers ranging from to we are done with we have one complete cycle now let us construct the cycle starting at problem that arises is that is not representable as 3 bit we would obtain by negating to what is still a valid 3 bit integer but then adding one to yields interpreted as unsigned integer it is but we have to interpret it as signed integer so actually for this example or in the general case is a second fixed point of integer arithmetic negation and are mapped to so the cycle is actually as is a cycle of length two and additionally enters the cycle via in consequence is correctly mapped to itself after two function is correctly mapped to after two function but is erroneously mapped to itself after two function we constructed a function that works for all integers but can we do we we have to construct cycles of length four and are able to cover the whole integer range up to four the remaining values are the two fixed points and that must be mapped to themselves and two arbitrary integers and that must be mapped to each other by two function map to and vice versa they must form a four cycle and they must be located at opposite corners of that in consequence and have to be at opposite this will correctly map and but swap the two fixed points and after two function applications and leave us with two failing so it is not possible to construct a function that works for all but we have one that works for all values except one and this is the best we can

 it is generally possible to call a dll function from multiple since every thread has own stack and calling a dll function is more or less the same as calling any other function of your own it is possible depends on the dll functions using a mutable or example if you do something like it is most certainly safe to be used from different in this example you guarantee that between and no other thread makes a different call to if the dll functions do not depend on some kind of predefined all necessary parameters are available at once and all other configuration is the same for all you can assume be it might be possible that a dll function looks but internally uses which if for example if the dll creates a temporary file with always the same name or it accesses a database which can only handle one request at a it counts as a shared i think of better the dll vendors that their dlls are use them from multiple threads without if they are not or even if the vendors know you should play it safe and use least until you run into performance in that case you could try creating multiple which wrap your dll calls and use them as

 just occurred to is a wild guess and probably not but maybe having a delayed ack problem due to your send buffer being smaller than the size of the data nagle may have nothing to do with the receiving side send any data back if your peer will delay ack for up to 200ms waiting to piggy back ack on some data to make better use of the send buffer on the socket is smaller than the data in this case the call to write will block until the ack has been received and all the data example if your send buffer is 8192 bytes and you send 8193 bytes and your peer sends no data back then your write will block for 200ms or however long your peers implementation delays the effectively making it look like nagle is killing you even when this is the case you could either increase the send buffer size or have your peer always send you back a null byte to force the ack to be sent i would maybe try playing around with a bit to model your applications send receive patterns and see if maybe something else is going

 just started learning common rapidly falling in love with just moved onto the type i seem to be developing a particular fondness for applicative i understand in cl strings and lists are both but there seem to be any standard functions for mapping over a only i can see why they would be supplied for what with them being the fundamental datatype and but why was it not designed to work with as they are a more general it would seem more useful to target applicative functions at them rather than or am i completely misunderstandimatifying how it i was feeling particularly confused about was the way that sequences the abstraction and lists an implementation seem to be muddled up in the consensus seems to be that this is for historical lisp has been around so long that you can pretty much map out the development of software engineering practices through its functions and which functions apply to sequences and which to lists seems arbitrary at first glance because cl has a mixture of functions that operate only on and functions that do the same thing in a more general way on as someone who is just learning cl at the i think it would be useful if authors introduced sequences first as the cleaner and then bought in lists as the most fundamental implementation of that lists would still be needed as syntax of but by the time it is necessary to state this explicitly many readers would have worked this out by which would be quite an ego boost when starting programming and common lisp

 kernighan was asked this question in a quote his torn on code tends to be bulky and very uninteresting and so it often gets in the way of learning and understanding the basic language at the same important to remind programmers that errors do happen and that their code has to be able to cope with personal preference is to pretty much ignore error handling in the earlier parts of a other than to mention that errors can and similarly to ignore errors in most examples in reference manuals unless the point of some section is but this can reinforce the unconscious belief that safe to ignore which is always a bad often leave off error handling in code examples here and on my own and noticed that this is the general trend on stack are we reinforcing bad should we spend more time polishing examples with error or does it just get in the way of illustrating the beginner the

 key thing to realise is that a uiscrollview is very intelligent about what it can move its subviews around and as long as the views that are visible on the screen do not move or there is no you can reset the frame of any offscreen subviews if necessary adjust the without causing a having paging enabled makes this a lot easier but sure you could do it from didscroll should generate your 5 views add them as subviews and set the offset of the scroll view to the center of the as the scrollview you can then switch the subviews around like a round there is no need to remove and the you can just reset the is a simple how a uitableview works too it reuses a small set of cell views and keeps resetting the content

 keyword static means different things on a method and on a on a method as in the example it means that it is class and you need not have an instance of the class to call create a new object dynamically you need to use or is to assign a temporary object to a assigning a temporary object to a point will not keep that object you could do the but it is not normally done because you would often want to keep many things created from a and then you would have to copy them rather than simply holding the pointer in a pizzafactory static if and return else if return return pizza by two mistake in code added missing const to a temporary object lasts only until the end of the full expression in which it deliberately specifies that binding a temporary object to a reference to const on the stack lengthens the lifetime of the temporary to the lifetime of the reference

 know all the answers to these but interesting questions so have a stab and hopefully someone can fill in the not in the default module are prefixed with the module and would reside in i think the reason for the and inconsistent naming library is that there would be little benefit having them in a nested folder controllers are part of your implementation so i think it makes traversing the folders does get a little could modify the or write a plugin to scan for directories and add is definitely overlap here the url helpers are a good example of generally a view helper generates markup so i think a big enough know the exact reason but guess it allows other helpers and view functionality to work together more for if used the doctype helper to set the the form element helpers can generate xhtml or html as definitely results in a lot of but not sure about not run in to any i can see the use in static but remember that stop you using if you have your static classes in your include path use or you can use them instead of or in addition to view

 know mysql very but i think have to give the standard performance answer thoughts only with not database a new database means a separate file in the file these files could then be put on different filesystems if performance of one needs to be separate from the new database will probably handle caching all tables in one db is going to mean a shared cache for the whereas splitting the tables into separate databases means each database can have a separate cache all databases will share the same physical memory for but there may be a limit per to the separate this means that if one of your datasets becomes more important than the it can easily be pulled off to a new the databases has an added benefit of allowing you to deploy updates more easily than with the single to having multiple databases means the server will probably be using more memory it has multiple sure there are more for the but i am drawing a blank i suppose i would recommend the obviously this is only with the understanding that there may very well be a better way of handling whatever you are actually

 know that cdo can be quirky at so these are the possible suggestions that i would queue would probably work the best for after i would consider setting up a local smtp server without inbound connection limits that uses a smarthost to queue up your outbound could actually be written fairly the is for and it actually all else you could always roll your own mailer component implementing rfcs 2821 and 2822 whatever the latest and greatest rfcs are for smtp and message if the newsletter you are sending out is identical for all you can address it to a dummy recipient and bcc it to the recipient list a subset of the recipient just be careful not to get flagged as unsolicited commercial let your provider know what you are they have to deal with the and you are the one paying the letting them know that complaints would be mostly unwarranted few and far will help to assuage their natural risk	
 know that tempting to assign names to servers that describe their functions and other similar attributes and in a perfect world that will work but in practice i have found that after a while these things get messed up as functions and other parameters of the servers change the requirements of the business so the names no longer reflect the think you should assign unique names to the servers that do not tell anything about the function or other parameters and have some sort of to list detailing those things so that your people can look it what we do other extreme is using ip addresses only or having names based on ip addresses which can lead to a disaster too if you ever have to change your ip

 known as is a licensing package that is commonly used by or specialized software for example in the electronic design automation you can lock a license to a single machine usually an ethernet mac or to a portable hardware or have a networked server handle sharing a limited pool of concurrent licenses to clients running your licenses can be granted for a limited time or and also can be limited by a version a license file describes the features that are includes several apis for integrating with your including one for i imagine it uses public key cryptography of some an application using flexnet only when you ask it to through your use of the many applications check the license at or reserve a license from the pool for the duration of the pay an annual license of to use flexnet in your starting above usd the fee varies by the revenue of your company and by the number of platforms you want your licensing scheme to be able to run would say not worth it to use something like flexnet if your product sells for less than several thousand usd per it is onerous to use source of a good percentage of support calls for our but corporate customers may already be familiar with using depending on the like every drm scheme heard is easily at least i assume it since unlocked versions of our products are regularly found on warez

 languages are typically built around the concept of hence it makes more sense for language features to reflect including this behavior can be confusing at times but part of the problem and advantage to having state in your think the best proof of this argument is to look at some of the more recently languages which have closure both and imperative oo chose to have mutable while a functional has immutable closures deriving from the idea that is immutable by what would it actually mean to have an immutable closure in an imperative most people think of this as making the variables equivalent to sure value types would be protected from but what about mutable reference you be able to change where the variable pointed but you could call a mutating function and get a similar for student public string name var student new name del could be implemented with an immutable closure as i actually modify where the variables point however i am clearly still doing a mutating

 learning the linux on a x86 architecture using the gnu as one of the aha moments was the possibility of using these system calls come in very handy and are sometimes even necessary as your program in system calls are rather expensive in terms of performance as they require an interrupt of course a system which means that a context switch must be made from your current active program in to the system running in point i want to make is currently implementing a compiler a university and one of the extra features i wanted to add is the support for code in order to enhance the performance of the compiled because some of the code will be automatically generated by the compiler this will almost guarantee that there will be really tiny bits of code in it as in order to gain a performance i must be sure that using threads will make this fear however is in order to use i make system calls and the necessary the tiny little threads will therefore be highly affected by the time it takes to make these system which could even lead to a performance question is therefore twofold an extra bonus question underneath it possible to write which can run multiple on multiple cores the need of i get a performance gain if i have really tiny threads as in the total execution time of the performance or it worth the effort at guess is that multithreaded assembler code is possible without system even if this is the do you have a suggestion even some real for implementing threads as efficient as in x86 assembler the gnu

 least take advantage of native datatypes that will do wrapping in the fastest for wrapping integers would be to make sure your data is scaled to or whatever native then when you need your data to wrap the native data type will be done in very and orders of magnitude than any software wrapping implementation seen an example case have found this to be very useful when i need a fast implementation of implemented using a for a basically you make scale your data such that is pi and is then have you are set to a side scaling your data will add some up front finite computation cost that usually looks something fixedpoint floatingpoint free to exchange int for something else you want like fastest more the mod operation is slow instead if possible try to use bit of the solutions i skimmed are functionally but they are dependent on the mod mod operation is very slow because it is essentially doing a the laymans explanation of why mod and division are slow is to equate the division operation to some def of and as you can the hardware can be if it is a low number relative to the but division can also horribly slow if it is much greater than the you can scale your data to a power of two then you can use a bit mask which will execute in one cycle on of all platforms and speed improvement will be approximately one order of magnitude at the very least 2 or 3 times faster code to implement int return a b int return a b free to make the something that is run and feel free to adjust the bit mask to be whatever power of two that you like 0xffffffff or power of two you decide on i strongly suggest reading about fixed point processing when messing with i suggest an introduction by randy yates august

 little bit comment is accurate in that there is a little less bookkeeping to be but the emphasis is on rather than the material matched by has to be kept so that you can use the appropriate to refer to it in the the notation means that does not have to keep track of the match so it is doing a little less do you mean by track of the how does it affect can use escaped parentheses to parts of the matched for suppose playing with simple c function declarations no pointers to functions or other sources of parentheses then we might have a substitute command such as the an input line such char double output will int char double c might you want to do imagining that i need to wrap the c function so that it can be called from a language compiled to c that uses a different interface convention it is based on informix to be using it to get an example not because you really need to know why it was a good change to in the the and in the replacement text refer to the captured parts of the regular expression the function name sequence of alphanumerics starting with an alphabetic character counting underscore as and the function argument list between the but not including the used the notation around the function then would refer to the argument list and there would be no because would not have to keep track of one of the two captured parts of the regular it has marginally less bookkeeping to do than if it had to keep track of two captured as i the difference is you could probably never measure it in why the manual says allows more if you needed to group parts of your regular expression but need to refer to them then you could work with longer regular by the time you have more than 9 remembered parts to the regular your brain is usually doing gyrations and your fingers will make mistakes anyway so the effort is not usually worth but that i the argument for using the it matches the perl notation for a regular

 look all that to since lots of languages have anything corresponding to the preprocessing reasonably accurate for a seem to be confusing virtual address space with disk file an adjunct to physical and works the same way for it uses the but not in the same way as using a know how physical memory virtual memory is a way of faking a larger memory in a way usually the file is divided into and the pages are read in from the disk as physical memory is divided into and the physical memory address have anything to do with the virtual address currently if the program uses more memory than is physically page frames will have to be so the contents of the page frame will have to be written back changed from when it was and a new page the program uses only part of its address space at a time and that part is few enough pages so they can all sit in physical memory at this works if constantly referring to more pages than can fit in physical pages constantly have to be read in from the disk performance drops and the disk is under constant when i have compiled and linked a an executable file on the in the file when i execute it gets assigned an address and then it gets more loaded into and how much physical and how much virtual memory is irrelevant to the user that if it have enough physical going to run awfully it is possible to run a 512m program with 256m of physical memory is requested from the it is assigned to memory at least the c and standard require that it be unless the request so looks to me to be an odd choice of it have to be in physical memory until

 look into protocol or like another poster you want to roll your please do it you use types from and make sure every variable has address is divisible evenly by size are are on even are on addresses divisble by you have to worry about alignment or a previous job we had all structures sent over our databus or canbus or byteflight or serial defined in there was a parser that would validate alignment on the variables within the structures you if someone wrote bad and then generate header files for various platforms and languages to send and receive the this worked well for we had to worry about code to do message parsing or and it was guaranteed that all platforms have stupid little coding some of our datalink layers were pretty bandwidth so we implemented things like with the parser generating the proper code for each we also had which was very nice be surprised how easy it is for a human to screw up coding bitfields on enumerations by you need to worry about it running on 8051s and hc11s with or over data link layers that are very bandwidth you are not going to come up with something better than protocol just spend a lot of time trying to be on par with

 looking to create a application using a using wcf as a possible communications will host the in a windows service with wcf using i suppose i could define every service operation into a single service but there could be quite a few operations and rather divide them into several cohesive service splitting my operations into a set of service contracts mean that i would have to host each service on a separate be ideal as prefer to run it on one design tips regarding this thanks for any confusion it my intention to host each service operation in a different only to group them my problem stems from the fact that i thought that it possible to host multiple servicehosts on one says that it is possible to simply host multiple service hosts on one i think i must have misunderstood an exception message when i was trying this out if i can get this to work then i think it will be my favoured think that and approach of implementing each interface on a single concrete object and hosting it in a single servicehost is also a good pragmatic solution to my especially if you treat that single concrete object as a sort of one downside i can think of is that you be able to have different servicebehaviors depending on the i do agree with logic of when appropriate to implement multiple service contracts on one concrete	
 looks like a solid way to do only suggestion is that if really concerned about performance with you may want to add generic versions for several common cases probably that for those objects are most likely to be composite you have the overhead of building the array to pass to the the any boxing of generic the call syntax will be exactly the but run slightly more optimized code for that of run some perf tests over this before you decide whether worth the maintenance like static int object t1 t2 t3 t4 int hashcode hashcode hashcode hashcode hashcode return

 main benefits of using real foreign keys are ensuring data and being able to set up cascading actions on related items when something is modified or imagine programming a you have a table with primary key and you have a table where posts are attached to topics with the column which is a foreign key to the topics foreign key relationship ensures that every post is attached to a valid if the only topic you have has id impossible for there to exist a post in the database attached to topic the database ensures the cascading you can set it up so that if a topic is deleted from the topic the database automatically deletes all the posts in the posts table that were attached to this this is nice because it removes a step that you have to remember to do which can get quite complex when you have many tables linked with foreign keys all the relationships can be cleaned up

 main reason for the character classes is so that the notation stops at the first white space even if you specify field and you quite often want it in that the character class notation can be extremely this code to read a line of up to 10 discarding any but keeping char int while int c if was actually example code for a discussion on june related to least some confusion the first format reads up to 10 characters and they are assigned to along with a trailing the second format contains the assignment suppression character and reads zero or more remaining characters from the when the function the input is pointing at the next newline the body of the loop reads and prints that so that when the loop the input is looking at the start of the next the process then if the line is shorter than 10 then those characters are copied to and the or more format processes zero	
 main things you can do easily in an eager language and not in a lazy from the source code the time and space costs of your side including update of mutable which makes it easier to implement some algorithms my the major benefit of an eager language is that much easier to get your code to perform the way you and there are very few performance traps in which a small change in the code leads to a huge change in said on the whole i prefer to write complicated things in

 maintaining a legacy embedded device which interacts with the real this device collects data from processes the data using its internal and displays warning when data reaches a certain debugging we wish this device will send us on a regular basis many of the data it as well as the data after it processed reached to the conclusion that most of the data can be described in a tabular something along the lines obviously need to support more than one form of basically we need a protocol that is able to accept a certain set of tables description and then to deliver table data according to its example pseudo code for sending data table example pseudo code for receiving data case for case the tables could be done either off line both at the device and at the client computer communicating with or we can add a simple handshake protocol to agree upon format at the this is a legacy it supports only rs232 and since its cpu is pretty slow to we cannot afford using any data transfer those are too expensive or sending raw sql commands was also considered and rejected due to bandwidth too reduce the overhead of sending the table header each trying to avoid sending the table header each time sending so that each time sending a table just have to send the tables also would like to note that most of the data i wish to pass is so protocols are too seen protocol close enough but it support idea about a known protocol or implementation like what i any better idea to send this aware to the fact that this protocol is not very hard to i had in mind a two phase send the headers of all tables you wish to each table description would include information about the size of each send the table index to followed by the actual data will be followed by a i wish to avoid the small details of such and use some or even use an available format to pass tabular

 martin by default most jms implementations will process message selectors on the they are part of a durable when jms implementations will process them on the server as well to avoid too many messages getting persisted when a significant reduction in the number of messages that get past the some systems allow you to specify that message selectors should be processed on the which is a good option in a case where you have excess cpu available on your message brokers but not on your in mind that while selection is usually it can be quite because if you want to listen to 5 different you have to have 5 different each of those in a naive driver implementation is a different and that can start to add for that it is often useful to support both from publication so that some clients can listen only to the topics that they and others can listen to the topic hierarchies they want with message selectors should always test against your application and your every broker handles the situation and every application functions you just say use technique because each technique for message processing has different thing to bear in mind with message selectors is that they dynamically so you have the possibility of losing messages or having to manually manage a complicated switchover imagine the following use are listening to a message selector of the form in wants to start listening to have to shut down the old messageconsumer and start a new one with a selector in the form in the you either lose messages you shut down the old one before starting the new or you have to manually remove duplicates you have the new one started before the old

 maurice herlithy shows in the art of multiprocessor programming that actually can be written without locks chapter this essentially involves splitting tasks into processing node elements a function and enqueuing each threads will calculate the state by following all nodes from the latest cached obviously this in worst result in sequential but it does have important lockless preventing scenarios where threads could get scheduled out for long peroids of time when they are holding herlithy also achieves theoretical meaning that one thread will not end up waiting forever to win the atomic enqueue is a lot of complicated queue stack is surprisingly hard the other things may be very become accustomed to atomiccas until i swapped it they are incredibly an intuition for correct with cas can help though you should use good testing and maybe more powerful tools upcoming mit or to check correctness if you can reduce it to a simple post more about your difficult to give a good answer without immutibility is nice but applicability is if understanding it it really overcome consider two threads executing they could both read then both write not the correct for a classic increment probably slow due to heap allocation has to be synchronized across

 maybe one of the few people here old enough to remember one of the big reasons why one return was pushed so so the compiler can emit more efficient for each function the compiler typically pushes some registers on the stack to preserve their this the function can use those registers for temporary when the function those saved registers have to be popped off the stack and back into the one pop mov instruction per if you have a bunch of return then either each one has to pop all the registers makes the compiled code or the compiler has to keep track of which registers might have been modified and only pop those code but increasing compilation reason why it still makes sense today to try to stick with one return statement is ease of automated if your ide supports refactoring a range of lines and turning them into a very difficult to do this if the lines you want to extract have a return statement in especially if returning a

 me coder for i have i put some code into a dll in the and now i am confused about how the gac is really working with our intranet environment i have several related web applications each application runs from a separate and potentially runs in its own app for now all of the apps are on the same but that is not this setup allows us to develop and migrate each app there are several parts of each app that we wanted to be common across all of our applications logon menus the request from management was that changes to these files could be and would take effect without having to and each web there are lots of ways to accomplish this and despite warnings to avoid the this really seemed like a case where using a virtual path provider and a dll stored in the gac made put together a virtual path and then embedded the files and resources i needed to be common into a could have had the vpp pull the files from a but i was hoping that embedding the files into the dll itself would be more want the developers of each app to have to mess with their own gac to test and run their so in each solution i just included the virtual path provider and made its result copy well as strongly this means that the provider along with its embedded files are copied to the bin directory of the as long as the developer have a version of this dll in their gac they the local bin copy is this allows the developer to easily change and test both the files and the files that are common to every also means that unless it is deliberately the common dll will exist in the bin directory of every app in production as since iis will always use the gac version if it even if the local version is out of the gac version is always accepted this as reasonable for now since i find an easy way to both have the copy local for and yet not copy to the bin when the app was copied to the coding an app so that it always uses the latest version of the dll instead of the specific version that it was compiled with seems like a fairly complicated i have yet to see a good example of how to do but i think i would need a chain of publisher it seemed much easier to try the more obvious answer leave the version number of the dll unchanged when migrating a new version of the vpp dll to the this seemed to work until it the windows on the i replaced an older version of of my dll in the gac with an updated copy of even though i had updated the dll in the my apps continued to use the old version of the restarting and even rebooting the server entirely did not seem to what really flipped me out was that eventually iis would mysteriously and unexpectedly correct itself and start using the correct copy of the dll from the have seen many gac related questions of this type that all seemed to end with of the sudden my website started working correctly it took a while for me to see that this was an effect of how iis was caching my strongly named and that i was the way strongly named were supposed to i tried removing the version of the dll from the gac because there was still a copy of my dll in the bin i expected that the process would either or to the version that was in the bin however because the version in the bin was also iis continued to use the cached copy of the which now no longer existed on the had me really baffled for a because i lost confidence that the gac version was ever running at the only way i had to assuredly get the dll to update was to remove the copy of the dll from the remove the copy of the dll from the bin run the site so that it would and then put the new version of the dll into the starting and stopping iis during this had no this consistently got my applications to use the new code much for simply sticking a new version of a dll into the gac and having its new effects propagate reading some related what i am trying now thesoftware of the dll in the gac still leaving the version number new dll at everything in the folder i think a but of a appears to be but it still seems like there is something wrong with having to go to all this is there an easier way to force iis to use the current instance of the is there a better way to accomplish the effect that i am common files and files shared among various that can be updated separately from the apps based on a comment from shahkalpesh i found this page at microsoft included this tiny tidbit of assembly redirect one version to use the the oldversion attribute can specify either a single or a of for specifies that the runtime should use version instead of the assembly versions between and means that along with my i could push a single publisher policy file that redirected everything to the that sort of mitigates what i thought would be a nightmare chain of where i had to maintain a link from every possible version to the will try this and see if updating the version like this also triggers iis to use the correct version of the new file resetting the app a dll in the gac that contains aspx pages for a web

 method is one of the most usefull methods in programming and many other such as have the exact same method implemented at the can define your own and the signature in must always be override string means this method will override the one define in the and returns a you manipulate your string in whichever way you want and then return the the specific reason you can use tostring on that integer is because within integers are all instances of the struct seeing as is at the same level of a it can have its own one of which is

 methods are absolutely not a programming in my like every other feature in oop just can be abused and they serve a valuable they allow you to relax your contraints on usage in a very specific case classes that are subclasses of you have selective access to routines you but still potentially hide from the rest of the this provides many benefits including reducing code duplication and improving maintainability allowing code to be consolidated into base many patterns require protected methods in order to function for the disposable pattern in is based around using protected virual methods to handle resource cleanup

 might be out of the scope of a java in global keyboard hooks are definitely out of the scope of simply using but i can help you get moving in the right you have some point you into the direction of native which will allow you to use native since you want to stay in the java i suggest not directly using jni because have to write some confusing native code there are several wrappers for jni that allow you to use the functions but the native implementations are abstracted but a lot of these cost the best solution for i is native this allows you to directly call native libraries from within the implementation not will be cross you have to make separate implementations for a good example for windows keyboard hooks in the examples on the project for opening own window not in a do you want the applet to not run within the browser but in its own separate or just be in a separate window and still rely on the browser window being you want to simply launch a new window and still require the browser to be then a good frame window new is the title is the public void you want the applet to spawn a new process and run without the need of the look into

 mvc paradigm is a way of breaking an application into three the the view and the mvc was originally developed to map the traditional output roles into user the modeling of the external and the visual feedback to the user are separated and handled by viewport and controller the controller interprets mouse and keyboard inputs from the user and maps these user actions into commands that are sent to the model viewport to effect the appropriate the model manages one or more data responds to queries about its and responds to instructions to change the viewport manages a rectangular area of the display and is responsible for presenting data to the user through a combination of graphics and even

 my based on my gut instincts and various anecdotal i think that is the key aspect you rewrite something from you will do it based on the experienced you gained doing it the first you rewrite something from you will fail for innumerable am not sure where the knee of the curve is for the transition from small to big success to guesses are that when multiple developers are on when multiple interacting components are or when the people who are doing the rework are not the same as the people doing the original or when the original product is old enough that it does not have the same of tests as newer then all these things contribute and also all these things are correlated to thus the only way to something is to do it one small component at a

 my opinion there some things you should think the customer need a function to customize his there a lot of different attributes or the effort of creating such an worth i think that its pretty obvious why you should think about it really depends on your project if that kind of model makes you want to create some a lot of forms that can be customized at runtime then this model could be pretty if you need to do a lot of smaller tools and you use this as some kind of then this effort could be worth it because you can save a lot of that kind of you could automatically add error check the values or add other things that are always build up with the same but if you have too many of this elements or attributes then the performance can go down things that becomes interesting in bigger projects that changes that have to occur in each form just have to be made in the not in each this could save a lot of time if there is a bug in the finished our company we use a similar model for an interface generator between now i cant remember the right word for and our just that it doesnt create an but an output file for one of the use xml to define the structure and how the values need to be converted and so

 my own application i need to validate dimensions as they are typed the sequence i used is as user selects or types then from the control loses focus and view sending id and view checks what shape class implementing a the form and passes it and entry shape program returns the response is ok the correct entry of the the response is ok the view form through a interface that ok to shift the focus to the next the response is not the at the response and using interface tells the form this usually means the back to the offending a message displayed telling what advantage of this approach that validation is centralized in one location for a given shape i have to go modify each control or even really worry about the different types of controls on the way back when i designed the software i decided how the ui going to work for combo also different levels of severity is handled view takes care of that instructing the form what to do through the how it actually is implemented is handled by the form itself in implementation of the the view care if the form is displaying yellow for warning and red for only that it handles those two later if a better idea of displaying warning vs errors comes along i can make the change in the form itself rather mucking around with the view logic or the validate in shape are already halfway there if you are considering making a class to hold your validation logic this will get you the rest of the way in your new

 natural inclination is to look at a bracket in the order the games are you read the traditional diagram from the outside but think of it the other way each game is played between two one the other a bit more to it than just the winners of a particular pair of games face off against each other in another so also a relationship between the games irrespective of playing in those that the teams that face off in each game in the first are the winners of two earlier you might notice that each game has two that precede it and determine who faces off in that this sounds exactly like a binary each root node has at most two child if you know who wins each you can easily determine the teams in the to design a database to model you really only need two and each has two foreign keys that relate to other the names but we would model them as separate keys to enforce the requirement that each game have no more than two preceding call them and to keep with the binary tree we should have a key called that tracks the reverse as i noted you can easily determine the teams that face off in each game by looking at who won the two preceding so you really only need to track the winner of each give the entity a foreign key to the the small matter of seeding the that modeling the for the first round you could model this by having a for each team in the overall competition where that team is the and has no preceding the overall schema would other attributes as you see other attributes as you see you would add all the other information want to the outcome case the game was won by forfeit or some other out of the ordinary

 not like martial where learning two very different styles at the same time can confuse your muscle memory and prevent the only is that by dividing your you divide your but not necessarily a big would say that javascript is a decent one to learn not only for the obvious functionality and but also because it has in if you do enough php and web eventually you will probably need is not among my favorite languages and can be frustrating to deal with especially depending on your but a fact of life right and syntax is widely used and good to with that you get some hooks upon which you might or and so many for how many languages i sure at least a dozen things that could qualify as right now i feel pretty strong in and probably a few others and some of those are barely but what do you think those stand will tell you learn as many languages as you not necessarily all at once and not necessarily but indulge and cultivate that curiosity a core developer because more languages more last jquery is a fantastic tool that makes javascript more very powerful and you get instant eye once got your head around the syntax of i would recommend looking at

 not saying that and is not insane horace but i am saying that there is a sane way to expect this i am dealing with i am focused on the elements in the array the index because the index is the method is each with or or this is also consistent with the index being viewed as an optional is equivalent to which is consistent with i am dealing with i am often more focused on the keys than the and i am usually dealing with keys and values in that either or you want then either explicitly use a defined method as brent longborough or an implicit method as maxhawkins is all about accommodating the language to suit the not about the programmer accommodating to suit the this is why there are so many there are so many ways to think about in you choose the closest and the rest of the code usually falls out extremely neatly and for the original is the way to iterate through an array in i think the core way without powerful syntactic sugar or object oriented is to index in 0 puts ruby is all about powerful syntactic sugar and object oriented but anyway here is the equivalent for and the keys can be ordered or key in puts my answer way to iterate through an array in ruby depends on you the programmer or the programming and the the better ruby programmer makes the better choice which syntactic power which object oriented the better ruby programmer continues to look for more i want to ask another is the way to iterate through a range in ruby question is how i came to this is nice to do the puts i like to do the puts i actually mind doing that too but when i am teaching going i want to show my students a nice symmetry with minimal only adding a or a step but without modifying anything can do puts puts i like but you puts puts puts puts puts puts i want this could ultimately def i want to teach pure ruby rather than object oriented approaches i would like to iterate creating an array for any range not just using any extra object oriented power no class believe this is impossible without defining a which means modifying the range class to use if you can do this please let me otherwise confirmation of impossibility would be appreciated though it would be perhaps ruby addresses for your time in reading

 not sure if anybody has spelled it out exactly this but you need to understand the is no element in a as others have sets have no a set is a mathematical concept that specifically does not include your computer really keep a list of stuff not ordered in it has to have some internally an array or a linked list or but you really know what it and it really have a first the element that comes out comes out that way by and might not be first next even if you took steps to a particular first still coming out by because you just happened to get it right for one particular implementation of a a different implementation might not work that way with what you in you may not know the implementation using as well as you think you run into this with rdbms systems and an rdbms query returns a set of this is the same type of set from an unordered collection of only in this case the items are an rdbms query result has no guaranteed order at all unless you use the order by but all the time people assume it does and then trip themselves up some day when the shape of their data or code changes slightly and triggers the query optimizer to work a different way and suddenly the results come out in the order they these are typically the people who pay attention in database class when reading the documentation or when it was explained to up that query results do not have a guaranteed

 not sure if they are completely interchangeable in this specific since you are basing the size of an array member on the i believe that it has to be an enumerated i have the time to look it up in the but i would be surprised if you can use an member as an array size even if it is since the actual value might not be visible in the in myclass static const int int in const int in think that the compiler can compile without having already compiled most other i would say with the class static option since it will participate a little more intelligently in type deduction and i only use enumerated integer constants when i really need to or when they are truly enumerated constants just took a look at the standard whilst i was munching away on lunch for the nudge can involve only literals variables or static data members of integral or enumeration types with constant expressions template parameters of integral enumeration and looks like the constant and enum will both work provided that you provide the constant initializer in the declaration is that

 not sure what you are worried from where i sit i can see three things your question can be related you may want to prevent unauthorized users from making a valid this is resolve by using the cookie to store a session the session id needs to tied to the be regenerated every time the user goes through the login process and must have an inactivity anybody request coming in without a valid session id you simply you may want to prevent a third party from doing a replay attacks against your site sniffing an inocent traffic and then sending the same calls the easy solution is to go over https for the ssl layer will prevent somebody from replaying any part of the this comes at a cost on the server side so you want to make sure that you really cannot take that you may want to prevent somebody from using your api what ajax calls are in the to implement his own client to your for this there is very little you can you can always look for the appropriate but easy to fake and will be probably the first thing somebody trying to use your api will think you can always implement some for example looking at the average ajax requests per minute on a per user basis and see if some user are way above your hard to implement and only usefull if you are trying to prevent automated clients reacting faster than human

 not that of be aware that ssis the xml such that there is one output from the xml source for each path through the a trivial example is produce three outputs and three error it gets will produce and both normal and error project i worked on started out having about 203 i was able to flatten the xml schema and produce only 19 or still a lot considering that each output needs to have own processing the xml task cannot handle 1gb or more of it load the entire document into try doing an of such a file and watch what happens what happens to had to create an element of my that processed the child elements of the root element one at a this enabled me to flatten the xml as well as handle large documents 10gb test document more fun depending on what you want to do with the resulting in my we had to send each of the outputs to staging this is not a bad but you have to realize that the data in the outputs are a single child element will reach the ends of the output paths a little at a and never know when all the descendants have finished being this makes it impossible to handle the processing on a transactional basis one element at a ssis adds a surrogate key think what to each child there would be a parentid added to the a childid to the and a childparentid also added to the to refer to the parent of the these can be used to the element back together but only after all data have finished being written to the staging the only time you can be sure that any given element has been processed in full when they

 not the only but say relatively personally not a fan of hungarian at least not in the simple sense that just restates the type information which is already present in the of hungarian notation will explain the difference never bothered me that but i can see their if you use a common prefix units of length vs units of you accidentally assign a length variable with a weight even though both may be for private members you can pretty much do what you want agree with your team what the naming convention should the important point is that if you want your to fit in with the rest of use hungarian notation in your public members

 not very experienced in database but my feeling is if your business classes are well the only point where you access the databse is in your repositories a change in the database is just a change in the implementation of your bad database design will make your repository hard to and slow to but it will not impact your business layer of your you try to modify your business layer because of your dao why not to modify your business layer because of your presentation layer and then good luck to satisfy all constraint and good think that both are but coding and database design should not be in the same more important for the developer is to isolate himself from the work of the db if the db designer and the developer are the same you should not have to think about two thing at the same

 nothing inherently wrong with using session state in an web as long as you use it sparingly and pay attention to good design for it make sense to cache large objects in session state and then use sql server to manage session you will be large amounts of data from a database which defeats the objective of caching it in the first using session state to store some primitives between pages seems ok to	
 nothing to facilitate custom sorting logic in the been one of my chief and one of the reasons that we decided to roll our own data access layer at my old i know how feasible this would be for you to to really achieve this need to add another column to your table as an then sort the rows in an array based upon your own comparison then store the index in the array in your rather than ordering by the column order by the do that this satisfy things like automatic sorting that gets done by a and it account for changes to the data that take place after you calculate the sorting i think anything that can really help with looking to sort this check and see if your visual control supports a custom sorting about all i can

 of a side there is an interesting talk given by juval lowey regarding if you have many tiny then you increase effort to if you have only a few large you decrease but you have more complex components to so your effort to integrate is dependent on the architecture and where it balances the number of components to their a good balance is because if you drift too one side or the the effort required increases if you have 20 components and add a not just more because you have to consider the interactions of the potentially other 20 so adding one component adds the potential for 20 ways to interact with the existing of course a good design will limit this interaction to as few components as but that was basically why juval felt it was

 of an interface as a contract to define or a a general approach and not really language in context of if you are working in a single inheritance there is an excellent case to be made for preferring interfaces over classes for defining your object since that single super class pathway is fairly precious and you want to save it for something more than defining properties that are exposed on an or have icontainer semantics is a fairly poor reason to make an interface out of your better to have your folder it is doing any the already icontainer or icollection interface in your core the better choice is fairly dependent on the specific in case of your recipes that are also folders you are probably thinking of a or relationship a semantic that can be expressed using interfaces if you will have other elements in your system on things that are composed using that sort of is a bit of overhead with if you find yourself when you are done with nothing more than a set of woof and iwoof classes and then know you probably need to express your problem in terms of interfaces simple classes would have been a for any you should have at least a couple of concrete classes more meaningful names other than or that

 on what it sounds like attempting a type of where a class is responsible for dynamically generating objects based upon information given from an external would recommend looking into design patterns for flex and i written a factory method in flex but it be much harder than which too what i would expect your program to look xml describes the object which will be generated your example appears to show have an xsd which can verify the xml file conforms to your expectations if it an appropriate error would be i would recommend something along these lines for you need to have a mechanism which guarantees the xml is abstracted the values you are expecting to be in the i would recommend using enums or string values in a separate utility have a factory class whose sole responsibility is to take in the xml generate the objects based upon the and return it to whoever needs 4th is what you are looking or example shows what this factory method might look i recommend you also abstract out the string values into a variable or if return new first is confusing to it sounds like trying to create a dynamic object with a to it where is defined as data in the i know if this is even i would certainly think it not

 one line response would be that you lose one of the main benefits of this reduces the time to develop new code love to develop new so that should help your argument when adding a new type to an existing you have to add aside from figuring out which instance to in you are doing something wrong that the new class should simply be a drop in replacement for the appropriate way to handle this in java is to keep the code polymorphic and make use of so anytime they find themselves wanting to add another variable or do an instanceof they should probably be implementing an interface you can convince them to change the code it is pretty easy to retrofit interfaces into the existing code for that take the time to take a piece of code with instanceof and refactor it to be it is much easier for people to see the point if they can see the before and after versions and compare

 others are is not the right way to do are some about why your attempt to use is only clearing for your sample that apparently is coincidentally the bytes occupied by the simple fix would be to write which in this case would set both and if your class has any virtual methods and the usual mechanism is used to represent them by your then that will destroy the and break the instance by setting the pointer to which is problem is that if the type requires some constructor action more complex than just settings its bits to then the constructors for the members are but their effect is ruined by overwriting the content of the members with only correct action is to write your default constructor to just forget about trying to use for this at pointed out in a comment that the default constructors for and were actually called before the in the original code as while technically calling overwrites the members which is at best really bad and at worst invokes the demons of undefined the class is as long as the type is also plain old data as would be the case if were or all it would take is for to be some sort of value class to cause problems that could be really hard to if you were they would manifest early through access violations from dereferencing the null pointers created by but lady luck is a fickle and the more likely outcome is that some memory is leaked and the application gets or more op asked in a comment on another answer there a way to make memset answer there is chosen the and chosen to take full advantage of you have to pay for those advantages by using the language it simply correct to bypass the constructor in the general while there are circumstances under which it is and sensible to call in a this just one of

 others have there is no such thing as a loop in a file system if you realize that the path is part of a file unless its a cyclical symbolic if you bootstrap some distro say to a loop or even to a and do this on a debian you have now duplicated a lot of lets say you are running debian and bootstrap a minimal copy of it to is going to be the same as there is no way of avoiding already calling a on each node assuming using you may as callback insert the name of the node into an that has structure members that can store a hash of the file which is unlikely to md5 going to cut it for a hash table based on that digest and the file name in no danger of speeding up your but it will significantly cut down on time it takes to you use threads correctly and set the hashing and indexing can happen on one core while the other is bound multiple cores are checking for duplicate mounts is not going to be a plus sure your program would want to return the locations of all files named even if there are four identical copies to

 probably be storing the virtualized build as a giant if you want to version your you version the source not the compiled many shops do is store in version control the to recreate the build then you need one fixed image os plus a small number of files to install on and some places even have their server rebuild the app from on a clean os for every the os image itself as a giant binary nearly as you you you the you might save space if your vcs can do binary but that probably takes a ton of cpu and memory to and if on a is then no reason to make life painful just to save disk store your install in vc and rebuild the vm image as or just store vm images in normal i see any point in putting the images in

 process that is created gets its own environment which lives as long as the your shell is just like any other its environment is its you type with no see what many of these settings are there to control program your search desired x11 home directory not use is really whatever you need it to any time you need to store some useful bit of information as long list of command line options to some into a variable that other applications can or that you can access from the use the a i read the environment to determine the preferences and obey for the variable influences the output of my programs if it is the environment is where the user tells programs how to it also the environment is a handy place for the user to store useful as i described to your every program that is executed is a a process gets its own address space its environment is stored in that this the environment is specific to that process and lives only as long as the process think that i now fully understand your if someone says they are just noting that the environment resides in the address which is mapped by the kernel as virtual memory pages might be in physical some might be in shared dynamic process can access environment unless the process explicitly creates a map to that specific region and shares it with another a address space is completely private and isolated from other environmental variables live within that address the process could not access or manipulate	
 processor has instructions that when a certain condition is met it and otherwise it continues on to the next a into register the zero flag is set register 0 contains then jump to complex conditions b become a sequence of instructions that leaves a register in a 0 or non zero so the branchif instruction can jump or not jump based on the conditional are many conditional flags and some branchif instructions also operate on more complex conditions it might actually check to see if a register is equal to another rather than simply looking at each architecture is different and makes tradeoffs so the instruction set is but also speedy and moocha points out in the some architectures allow you to apply a conditional to or even all so you might not only have but also x86 is very complex beyond this simple explanation once you get into out of order and all the other advanced for most purposes the above explanation is if writing a hand crafted very tightly wound have to take these things into account for maximum performance and a topic for another question	
 processors do a single set of micro instructions per clock these usually involve things like switching a bus into a register or the alu logic the next micro instruction might clock the register or alu to do something with the data on a most assembly level instructions are built up with a series of micro an addition instruction only takes a few micro but dividing may take many most micro controllers document how many cycles each assembly level instruction more sophisticated microcontrollers there is also an instruction pipeline cat which means the processor can start doing part of the next instruction before the previous on has this can become very complicated with concepts like predictive when you simulate digital electronics you use an event based model as electronic systems are but also have propagation delays that need to be i remember using tools like pspice and microsim at uni that did this very	
 production animators use specialized tools such as 3ds max to generate keyframed animations of 3d for each animation for each the animator constructs a number of poses for the model called the which are then exported out into the data game then loads these and to animate the model at a particular it picks the two nearest keyframes and interpolates between them to give a smooth even with a small number of models are typically constructed with a bone there is a root which controls the location and orientation within the game all of the other bones are defined relative to some parent bone to create a each vertex of the model is tied to a particular so the model can be controlled with a much smaller number of the relative and scales of each skinning is a technique used to improve the quality of with smooth a vertex is not tied to just one but it can be tied to multiple bones a hard such as is vertices rarely need more than with corresponding this makes the job since he has to do a lot more work with vertices near but the result is a much smoother animation with less distortion around the some games use whereby the animation data is constructed at the bone positions and orientations are computed according to some such as or other options are of course but they must be coded by of procedurally animating the bones and using forward kinematics to determine the locations of all of the another option is to just procedurally generate the position of each vertex on its this allows for more complex animations that bound by bone but of course much more complicated and much harder to do

 proja depends on projb and projb depends on proja then i am surprised you can build it at this sort of circular build dependency normally kills clean you often get away with it on dev machines where an old proja is still lying around when you build projb and but on a clean machine then this kind of dependency often breaks what the dependencies it might be simplest to move the common dependencies to a new assembly that has no dependencioes of its but which both proja and projb depend this means you can then build then proja and projb in any order this kind of refactoring is often simplest when you are only depending on interfaces from projc rather than concrete sure this entirely answers your but it might give you an alternative way to fixing	
 project group is working on a java language extension and we have been trying to figure out what tool we should use for this the extension will primarily consist of a modification of the concurrency model used in we have been looking at two tools so polyglot and javacc seems to be a bit more easy to but as we will be making some significant changes to the language it might still not be a good idea to use it over the more advanced polyglot as it might be better at coping with the increased you have any experience with these tools do you have other tool is the best tool for creating a java

 question below is based on the assumption that controls are always binded to data source controls in the order they are so in our example sqldatasource1 will connect to data source prior to sqldatasource2 and thus will be populated with values before and reason for that being that was declared before if then when exactly does retrieve a value from i assume after event handler and before event but when it is a then those parameters will get loaded from a viewstate on the in the order they are assume controlparameter is bound to property c1 of a control i would imagine that on postbacks controlproperty would always be able to get value from no matter of what type c and even if c has viewstate but may i ask if a page is created for the first a value for controlparameter also be retrieved from the moment lstcities retrieves data from data has its value apologize for not replying but i realize and when i spent good 20 minutes trying to get my 3 braincells to work but not sure if i quite so controlparameter evaluates and thus retrieves value after c has been controlparameter only reads its own state and only to determine if it so controlparameter checks whether its viewstate changed in order to fire onparameterchanged before binding takes place thus it checks its viewstate during how will controlparameter know that its viewstate has changed it will know on first postback from the first time the page is created viewstate will always be marked as so how from one postback to controlparameter know whether its value has changed between i assume controlparameter checks whether its viewstate changed only so that it can fire onparameterchanged but why is handling that event so first time a property evaluation happens is on property evaluation you mean controlparameter checking its own thus you mean controlparameter evaluating which i assume happens after c has been bound really appreciate your really sorry for again taking your will do my best to make this my last is called both in onloadcomplete and when data binding takes inside the following sentence is also if is called when data binding takes then what that means that when on next postback is called in and controlparameter will already have same values and thus if null storedvalue null actualvalue always return false when is called in onloadcomplete and so onparameterchanged event will never get if the i fail to see the need to call in controls are always binded to data source controls in the order they are declared

 question is a little i wrote an algorithm for breaking up a into convex but now having trouble proving that optimal minimal number of convex polygons using my prof is adamant that it be done with a greedy algorithm such as this but i think of a if anyone can prove my algorithm is suboptimal i would appreciate easiest way to explain my algorithm with pictures are from an older suboptimal my algorithm is extends the line segments around the point i across until it hits a point on the opposite there is no vertex within this it creates a new one red and connects to there one or more vertices in the it connects to the closest this produces a decomposition with the fewest number of convex in some cases it can fail in the following if it happens to connect the middle green line this will create an extra unneeded to this i propose double checking all the edges and check that they are all still if remove some this is not see this and with would yield a better in this scenario no edges to remove so this poses a in this case i suggest an order of when deciding which vertex to connect a reflex vertex it should choose the vertex with the highest closest closest reflex closest reflex that is also in range when working backwards to we can see that the reflex vertex 9 chose to connect to 12 it was when it would have been better to connect to both vertices 5 and 12 are in the range as defined by the extended line segments and but vertex 5 should be given preference because 9 is within the range given by and but not in the range given by and the edge elimates the reflex vertex at but does not eliminate the reflex vertex at but it can eliminate the reflex vertex at so 5 should be given is possible that the edge will still exist with this modified but it can be removed during there any cases by john this is missing the bits under figures 3 and vertices in are given in ccw mean that if is being compared with then is in the range given by the rays and each vertex if is find the closest point of intersection given by the ray starting at and extending in the direction of this lower repeat for the ray given by this upper if there are no vertices along boundary of the polygon in the range given by the upper and lower create a new vertex exactly half way between the lower and upper bound points and upper will lie on the same connect to this new iterate along the vertices in the range given by the lower and upper for each vertex if is a if no other good reflexes have been save it any other vertex if it is closer then the other good reflexes save if no good reflexes have been found and it is closer than the other vertices save connect to the best repeat entire algorithm for both halves of the polygon that was just no reflex vertices then is out there is one more case i algorithm will attempt to connect vertex 1 to unless i add another check to make sure it so i propose stuffing everything the onto a priority queue using the priority scheme i mentioned then take the highest priority check if it can if pop it off and use the i this makes my algorithm n log if i optimize it for a little more maybe this put together that loosely describes my i tend to move stuff so get it while to convex

 question is mainly geared towards zend in although it certainly applies to other languages and so i welcome only recently been using the zend and while not i have had a pretty good time with one thing that drives me is that most of the examples i see of people using zend do the in special form rather than in the i think this is bad practice because data can enter into the system in other ways beyond form which means that either validators have to be bent and twisted to validate other or validation must be done in a second and logic found some other posts and blogs out there with people who feel the same way i but the developers of zend made this choice for a and other people seem to use it without so i wanted to get some feedback from the community i this mainly applies to although i think important to look at the issue as a rather than working within the confines of the zend since zend was designed so that you could use as or as as you validation be done in form or the	
 question is similar to to concisely cascade through multiple regex statements in except instead of matching one regular expression and doing something i need to make sure i do not match a bunch of regular and if no matches are found i have valid then do i have found one way to do it but am thinking there must be a better especially if i end up with many regular i am filtering for bad stuff that occurs when i yank what looks like a valid url out of an html document but it turns out to be part of a javascript thus needs to be and thus the escaping i use beautiful soup to process these pages since they are far to mangled i use then fall back to my ugly but workable far i have found the following works relatively i compile a dict or regular expressions outside the main loop i only have to compile it but benefit from the speed increase every time i use i then loop a url through this if there is a match then the url is if not the url is pattern in match if do stuff here the obvious thought is to use regex reduces the number of compares and but makes it much harder to trouble shoot one expression per compare i can easily add a print statement matched by key is there someway to get the best of both worlds minimal number of yet still be able to print out which regex is matching the or do i simply need to bite the bullet and have my slower but easier to troubleshoot code when debugging and then squoosh all the together into one line for means one more step of programming and code maintenance and possible answer by dave so the actual code for this would look do stuff here for print matched multiple negative regex to expression in

 question seems to be it worth learning wsgi and doing everything or using a stack framework that does everything for say a false dichotomy and an obvious third turbogears 2 tries to provide a smooth path from a everything for style framework up to an understanding of wsgi and an ability to customize almost every aspect of the framework to suit your may not be successful in every place at every but particularly if already got some turbogears 1 experience i think the tg2 learning curve will be very easy at first and have the ability to go deeper exactly when you need address your particular provide an authorization system out of the box that matches the one used to from provide an out of the box like interface called the which works great with dojo to make a fancy spreadsheet like interface the also like to address a couple of the other options that are out there and talk a little bit about the i think cherrypy is a great webserver and a nice minimalistic not based on wsgi internally but has good wsgi support although it will not provide you with the but for custom setups that need to be both fast and particularly suited to the defaults provided by django or a great i think django is a very tigtly integrated system for developing if your application and style of working fits well within standard setup it can be if however you need to tune your db replace the template use a different user authorization model or otherwise do things differently you may very likely find yourself fighting the pylons like cherrypy is a great minimalistic unlike cherrypy wsgi enabled through the whole system and provides some sane defaults like sqlalchemy and mako that can help you scale the new official docs are of much better quality than the old wiki docs which are what you seem to have looked	
 question should what would you do with that if you have clear business do did something similar and after 3 years of running there is about of and rest is and it is 10 million 40 million in last three years we had 2 requests to investigate history of changes and both times requests were silly we record time stamp of record change and we were asked to check if persons worked overtime we are stuck with oversized database that contains of data that nobody you asked for possible describe what we a bit different than solution you are tables have surrogate primary primary keys are generated from single this works fine because oracle can generate and cache so no performance problems we use orm and we wanted each object in memory corresponding record in to have unique use orm and mapping information between database table and class is in form of record all changes in single archive table with following primary of original type data as varchar2 is actual data in form of works this has and delete created one base class for all our business objects that overrides and delete commands commands create string in form of pairs using code looks for mapping information and reads field associated value and field then we create something similar to json added some when string representing current state of object is it is inserted into archive new or updated object is saved to database it is saved to his target table and at the same time we insert one record with current value into archive object is we delete it from his target table and at the same time we insert one record in archive table that have transaction type have archive tables for each table in we also need to worry about updating archive table when schema archive is separated from so archive does not impose any performance hit on we put it onto separate tablespace on separate disk and it works created 2 forms for viewing viewer that can list archive table according to filter on archive filter data user can enter on form we show each record in form and each change is color users can see all versions for each record and they can see who and when made viewer this one was but we created form that shows invoice very similar to original invoice entry but with some additional buttons that can show different it took considerable effort to create this form was used few times and then forgotten because it was not needed in current for creating archive records is located in single there is no need for triggers on every table in is very at peak system is used by around this is both and oracle are running on one dual xeon with 8gb table archive format is harder to read than solution where there is one archive table for each of the data on field in archive table is hard we can use only operator on the requirements on it is not trivial but gains and use can be

 question that the answers given so far seem to if the runtime libraries the can keep track of the number of things in the then why do we need the syntax at why a single form be used to handle all answer to this goes back to roots as a language it no longer really strives to philosophy was that the programmer should not have to pay for any features that they if not using then they should not have to carry the cost of object arrays for every allocated chunk of if your code simply foo new the memory space allocated for include any extra overhead that would be needed to support arrays of only array allocations are set up to carry the extra array size you then need to tell the runtime libraries to look for that information when you delete the why we need to of bar is a pointer to an most of us that fussiness about a few extra bytes of memory seems quaint these but there are still some situations where saving a few bytes what could be a very high number of memory can be	
 question very clear so going to assume that doing some kind of image processing and the results you get are values from to 1000 and now you need to save the color to a file where every value needs to be between 0 and you do this is really very dependent in the what is really the meaning of the results and what exactly you want to the two main options the values anything under 0 you replace by 0 and anything above 255 you replace by want to do this for instnace if your image processing is some kind of interpolation which really reach these normalization linearly may your minimal value to 0 and your maximal value to of course first need to find the minimum and you this does is first map the values to and then stretch them back to third option is to mix and match between these two your application might demand that you treat negative values as unneeded values and clamp them to 0 and positive values to linearly map to

 quick the stl and boost headers do indeed belong in the precompiled header even though these header files define template generating a precompiled header a compiler parses the header text significant and converts it into a binary format that is optimised for the though the template classes will be instantiated when other files are they will be instantiated from information in the precompiled which is significantly faster for the compiler to thing that you should include in a precompiled header are files that are part of your project and are changed even if every single file includes these reason is this the generation of the precompiled header can take a long because the stl and windows libraries are very might have a simple file that everything if is included in and one developer touches then every developer has to wait until the precompiled it would be much faster if was left out of the precompiled and parsed along with each

 rcp provides mechanism so that you can add new features later on the also via the update mechanism you can change the system without user in the development eclipse rcp provides a robust ground with command and action if your project requires many different windows with different toolbar and menus also custom context i suggest you to use eclipse i only check the videos of netbeans platform and run the helloworld project but it seems slow and clumsy 40 seconds to can reload the application though is a good collection of tutorials for eclipse

 read a few questions on so as in regards to versioning your data within a liked some of the suggestions that were i have for the longest time wanted to revision many of my tables but never got around to being a programmer with only simple database work under my belt i was wondering how one would actually go about doing not asking for the actual solution in sql i can eventually figure that out for myself post so when the time just asking for people to comment as how they would go about doing it and any potential performance problems there might be if i was to hundreds of million of or any other suggestions as long as it is based on the example a simple uint not uint not not date not not uint not uint not not uint not uint not date not not null not sure how one would link the audit table to any other tables as if the tablename is a assuming that i have three to full record for a specific person table view listing all persons view showing each person with their revision info below each entry of revisions per dates of revision ordered by the most recent accomplish 1 and would it be better to query the person table or the audit accomplish would a so called database expert simply get all records and pass it on to the software for or group by personid and affected is this usually handled in one query or data

 read somewhere a nice rule about this that i like very it says function should throw an exception if and only if it cannot perform the task it was meant what i usually do is to decide what a function should do usually comes from business requirements or and then throw exceptions for everything you have designed your application your functions will be pretty small and perform relatively simple tasks with simple return deciding on exceptions by the above rule will not be there are always ambiguous cases with a key not found in a those should be far and but there just have to use your gut feeling on what is the more elegant and with all this never for this to work well an nice only catch exceptions that you can mostly that means you will catch them only in the upper ui levels where you can display to the user and log them or lower levels might use blocks or rethrow exceptions after some processing of their but genuine caught exceptions in low levels usually indicate bad

 read that it will only make you read this book the definitive the maven site has a lot of but the structure is terrible so need to use google to navigate in is my this by not with from the maven integration work that good not in any sure you program project is divided into modules under a common umbrella so that each module produces a single binary artifact possibly accompanied by the javadoc of the source code behind that a zip with the source code the basic principle is that each module produces a single containing all the under that you can do this while the project is still built by module should conform to the standard maven directory the build destination is under the source code is under and the artifact consists of all the code under and none of the code under as it built to the target you can do this while the is still built by by transforming the that has no dependencies on other modules in the you can create the parent maven module with artifact type consisting of one of the modules make a child module for the first submodule one with only external using the umbrella module as remember that you need to specify version for the remember to add the child module as a in the parent always use as version in the child modules when you create projects like all modules under a parent must be released simultaneously in a single and if you use this setting maven will make sure the version fields stay the same across all modules and gets updated everywhere during the this may make it difficult to the existing numbering but that you are never going to run out of version numbers the necessary and make sure you can build the parent and the child module together using the command clean from the parent with the rest of the modules the same dependencies to other modules under the same parent project should also use as the they are depending meaning same version as note that in order to the module you are depending on must be built using so that it gets deployed to you local otherwise the depending module will not be able to find the there are no dependencies between modules in only dependencies to built and packed versions installed in local and remote this can be very confusing if you come from build from the root module until you get comfortable with it takes two use maven integration in it is a bad use or to set up your workspace as a ordinary ide the dependencies mechanisms in maven and the ide identical and will never if you have several mavenized projects with dependencies in you want to have several of these in your workspace with dependencies set up you can do this with mvn if you create a separate maven project file called in the same directory as parent set up as a project containing modules and reference no parent ref if you run you get a workspace with all these modules linked no ide integration lets you do this sound like a lot of extra but the is really it have to contain all that dependency stuff and all only the reference to the modules you want to bind together in your

 real consideration between separate date and time fields or 1 datetime field is you do not want to do from where a datetime field because it use an mysql will convert the startat data to a date in order to compare which means it use the want to do from where startat between and problem with a datetime field is that you really use it a compound index since the value is fairly for a compound index on going to allow you to search on only if you split the data between date and time you can index and search on it just an example for discussion you could obviously index on instead and it would but you may find yourself wanting to based on date plus another creating a compound index on that data would make it very

 really depends on your site and your seen a site peek out at over 350 active connections to sql during its peak that was for roughly concurent web on two web plus various backend additional information that we need to give you a better many web processes hit your for example are you using do you have multiple many if you this is important because then you can calculate how many connections you can have by figuring out how many worker threads per process you have assume worse each thread is running which would add a connection to the you using connection if so your going to see the connections stick around after the request by default its many concurent users do you i think your going after this your having an issue with no free connections available in your the first thing look for is any leaked connections being held open for longer then they for example passing a data reader up to the web could be a sign of thing is to evaluate the default maybee you should run a web garden which should give you more or increase the number of connections last thing i would do is try to opitmize queries like in your last say you cut those queries in all done is bought yourself more time until more users come onto the and your right back only this time you might not be able to optimize that query yet

 reason for this is because is defined as a value on and a value on when the 4th argument is passed into the variadic the upper bits appear to be the 4th and 5th values that are pulled out are can solve this problem with a simple cast on all the such does not answer all my such is it the 4th likely because the first 3 are in does one avoid this situation in a portable this happen on other using values that might be on some i pull out the values as values regardless of the target and will that cause problems if a value is pushed into the variadic do the standards say about this really wanted to get a quote from but something not and costs money to and therefore i believe quoting it would be a copyright the made clear that when writing a function that takes a number of nothing you can do for type up to the caller to sure that each argument either perfectly matches or is explicitly there are no implicit much should be obvious to those who understand c and that gcc has a feature to format but not so obvious is that not only are the types not implicitly but if the size of the types match you can have uninitialized or undefined behavior in the where an argument is placed might not be initialized to and there might not be a some platforms you could pass a and extract two values inside the variadic undefined

 reason why it is probably coming back is due to the fact that we know have screens with high enough refreshrate so that 3d is i think i read that you will need somewhere around 100hz for no need for bulky glasses to you no longer need glasses in order to have 3d this article was posted in a swedish magazine a few weeks it says is basically that instead of glasses you use a technique with vertical lenses on the problem with crt is that they are not our more modern flat screens obviously got this second problem is that you need high frequency least 100 hz as that makes the eye get 50 frames per and a lot of since each eye only gets half the sets that support 3d have been sold by various companies since	
 reason why your code work is due to how php handles indexed arrays inside you what php wanted to see single quotes this you only omit those single quotes if you are referencing a variable directly inside a that string such as can work with simple arrays but not with arrays of arrays unless you use curly braces note the single quotes in the curly exactly like normal string but rather more like referencing a variable elsewhere in

 reference to which was excellent only described the when and where to use the another part of the answer is why are they needed many languages get along just fine without when designing aspects of the delphi object pascal oop oriented had been in the mainstream for several during this time it was observed that using many of the languages that had adopted those concepts to develop application frameworks suffered from what i called the you developed an awesome framework using language x and released it as version your users raved at all it could do and it became heavily flush with you decide to release version 2 with even more you specifically made sure it was fully backward you users started reporting strange their own virtual methods were being called at strange many reported that their old code would not compile with the new all the same and functionality still all you did was add a few virtual methods to some base some new object and some new optional what override and reintroduce directives serve to eliminate this problem by requiring that in order to actually a virtual method you must use the override directive in place of the virtual if you happen to introduce your own virtual method that has the same name as one of your virtual the compiler now warns but will still do the right in this using not only suppresses that it also serves to document in the source you intended to do the override and reintroduce you would not be able to continually evolve your framework without fear of breaking all your and if your users had to make massive modifications every time a new version is then they would be loathe to adopt the new using also allows the framework designer to change the type of virtual in the ancestors without breaking user for in delphi many methods are marked which is a runtime method lookup form of perform quite as fast as a regular virtual so it is usually used for methods that are rarely overridden are responses to user actions where the extra overhead is never suppose in v1 of the framework a method was marked but in practice it ended up being overridden and called more than you in you could change it to without fear of code being object pascal language the only language to recognize this requires the use of an directive for the exact same the standards committee is finally recognizing the problem and are modifying the language to support sort in if a name and parameter list matches an then it is an override if you say on the for the upcoming new if you specify and the signatures match then it is a new virtual method introduced on current if there is a signature match with the ancestor and the writer intend to then the keyword is used to tell the compiler that this is a virtual for this

 regexp would look something like this var html html segment is the important it finds an asterisk followed by one or more word characters followed by some sort of word termination end of or a the word is captured into which is then used as the text and the class of the part just after that is a negative it asserts that a closing angle bracket does not unless there is an opening angle bracket before this prevents a match where the string is inside an html this handle malformed but that be the case

 relational database is not your best first choice for want all of your editors to pass changes to your player is effectively a server for all those your player needs multiple open it must listen to all those connections for it must display those the changes are really you can move to a hybrid solution where the editors persist the changes notify the the editors must notify they player that they have a much simpler than the player trying to discover changes in a better design is a server which accepts messages from the persists and notifies the this server is neither editor nor but merely a broker that assures that all the messages are it accepts connections from editors and it manages the are two server is the server is separate from the the design of server change only the when server is the then server calls the player objects when server is separate from the then the server writes to the the player is part of the player objects are invoked directly when a message is received from an when the player is a small reader collects the messages from a socket and calls the player player connects to the server and then waits for a stream of this can either be input from the editors or references to data that the server persisted in the your message traffic is small enough so that network latency is not a editor sends all the data to the if message traffic is too then the editor writes to a database and sends a message with just a database fk to the clarify the editor crashes while the player is permanently messed in your sounds like a poor design for the player it be messed unless not getting state from the various if getting state from the editors attempting to mirror that for then you should consider a design where the player simply gets state from the editor and cannot get messed

 results you are getting are consistent with 32bit without knowing more about your not possible to advise what to the code shown is ie not converting anything to strings or then there a fix within outside of the code and depends on the patrick mcdonald and treb brought both up the accuracy of your inputs and the error on i thought take a look at one technique to look at rounding errors is interval which makes the upper and lower bounds which value represents explicit are implicit in floating point and are fixed to the precision of the by treating each value as an upper and lower and by extending the bounds by the error in the representation approx x 2 for a double value x you get a result which gives the lower and upper bounds on the accuracy of a taking into account worst case precision if you have a value in the range and subtract from it a value in the range then the result must lie in the range as the minimum result is and the maximum is and are equivalent to floor and but for the next representable value rather than for intervals which represent double a b c d double precision although is small compared to or it is still large compared to double so if you were using the worst imaginable double precision then you could trust that to be precise to 12 figures lost a few figures off double but still working to more than your if the inputs were only accurate to the number significant then rather than being the double value then the input range would be so you get the a b c d specified accuracy is a much wider you would have to go out of your way to track the accuracy in the and the rounding errors inherent in floating point are not significant in this example precise to 12 figures with the worst case double precision the other if your inputs are only known to 6 it actually matter whether you get or both are within

 safest approach is to fall back to the lowest version you need to that assumes all versions are backwards compatible which necessarily the that solution appropriate or desirable then i fall back to the is by far the most popular and common di framework but no means the only is another you can even roll your own if undesirable to add a complete framework for i have problems envisioning a java a i do without using simply too say there are 4 versions of a relevant the api has changed twice in that time so you have 3 different api you need to abstract use of that jar to an api of your own that is consistent across all these versions and then create three implementations of one for each different api spring you create an application which defines all your beans and how injected into other there is no reason you choose or build and application context as part of a build often properties are used for this but you could also include part of the application context this way key point here is that even though the apis are different you need to abstract away those differences as far as your code is if you just asking for trouble and it just gets

 same approach is used for the saml web browser sso the primary motivations of using html post redirection are unlimited length of the payload in saml the payload is a xml document signed with xmldsig and base64 it is larger than the usual 1024 characters limitation of url best practice to support not only any browsers but intermediary network devices like reverse load balancer as http standard says that get is idempotent same url get executed multiple times should always result in same and consequently can be cached along the way while post is not and must reach the url response of an openid html form post or saml html form post should not be it must reach the target in order to initiate the authenticated could argue that using a http get redirection would work as well since the url query always change and you would be right is this would be a workaround of the w3c and should not be a standard but an alternate implementation whenever both end agree with

 schemas are often identified with a uri and while they may be formatted similarly there is no guarantee that there is anything there because it is not a ability to identify the correct xml schema is necessary if you must validate an xml a means of identification must be shared between the content and the schema authors before successful validation can mean anything uris fill this need as good as anything keep in mind that the schema is not necessarily needed in order to make use of the xml therefore it does not need to be universal locatable or it simply needs to be the semantics of a uri avoid the implication that the resource must be located as would be the case with a and with good such a detail is irrelevant to the task of publishers will often base the uri off of a url which they i can imagine there are many reason for doing but for it helps avoid naming conflicts without an when using such a convention it is hard to resist hosting the definition at the location the uri would point to if it where a while by know means i believe doing so marks an appreciated and is an example of good information but this fact remains unrelated to needs filled by a

 seems to me that using the average is a little if joke a has 1 rating of 5 and joke b has 25 ratings of then joke a will rank above joke it gives unpopular jokes more of an advantage to be ranked would suggest associating weight to ratings and then ranking by the for on a scale from 1 to 1 would get a 2 would get a 3 is 4 is and 5 would get a so this would allow a joke with 5 ratings to be ranked higher than the joke with 1 to scale may need some but hopefully you see my

 send the default of the default for a only if a program does not shutdown in a reasonable amount of time should you resort to for hup stands for and historically meant that the modem essentially equivalent to the reason that daemons sometimes use sighup to restart or reload config is that daemons detach from any controlling terminals and therefore would never receive so that signal was considered as for general not all daemons use this for the default action for sighup is to terminate and many daemons behave that so you go blindly sending hups to daemons and expecting them to sigint is probably inappropriate to terminate a as normally tied to or whatever the terminal setting is to interrupt a many programs capture this for their own so common enough for it not to sigquit typically has the default of creating a core and unless you want core files laying around not a good if you send sigterm and the program die within your timeframe then send it

 should to prevent writing lines longer than 80 rather than breaking to minimize indentation by converting conditions and encapsulating if you need more than 3 levels screwed and should fix your also has the side effect of making you code much more besides that the conditions are the other things you encapsulate are ready to be used add some if return if return return some try not to introduce deeper your condition through boolean algebra and trying to invert the condition and return value can help a also refactor for has the ability to assist you with type definitions and try to avoid long simple imagine how long it would be using days without typedef with longer names in another some some some other container that would else be should try to analyze why your line is long and find a solution for you get the general this way you need to come up with a dirty line only place where i would see long lines occur is in the prototypes of your functions or when calling there you should just try to break after the last possible comma and continue on the next rather than doing it after each and wasting multiple lines making scrolling bloated and your function stand out too you could place the return type on the line before the function name if you happen to frequently see these long parametertype2 parametertype3 parametertype4

 should use a parser when you are interested in the or semantic meaning of when patterns can parsers are generally overkill when you are simply looking to or replace patterns of regardless of their functional your you seem to be interested in the meaning behind the text of so a parser would be the better parsers internally make use of so they should not be regarded as mutually does not automatically mean it has to be for if you are interested in c code you could simply parse nested groups of and this parser would only be interested in two tokens and and the blocks of text between a simple regex comparison is not sufficient here because of the nested take the following parser will understand the overall scope of as well as each inner scope contained within foo if and else as it encounters each it their a simple however does not understand the meaning behind the text and may interpret the following to be a which we of course know is not

 so here is a problem analogous to my problem elaborate on the real problem but i think this analogy will be easier to have a strange coin that only comes up heads 1 in every tosses remainder being in other for every tails i there will be 1 have a peculiar disease where i only notice 1 in every tails i but i notice every and so it appears to me that the rate of noticing a heads or tails is of aware of this disease and its effect so i can compensate for now gives me a new and i noticed that the rate of noticing heads is now given that my disease changed still only notice 1 in every how do i calculate the actual ratio of heads to tails that this new coin need to understand this to help with this so if it confuses you ignore it so what is the real i have a bunch of data consisting of and outputs which are 1s and i want to teach a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict the expected output float between 0 and given an the problem is that the 1s are very and this screws up the internal math because it becomes very susceptible to rounding errors even with floating point i normalize the data by randomly omitting most of the 0 training samples so that it appears that there is a roughly equal ratio of 1s and of this means that now the machine learning output is predicting a instead of predicting as it it would now predict need a way to convert the output of the machine learning algorithm back to a probability within the original training a known bias in collected	
 so in php will lead to the loading parsing of and execution of more php if you do go this get to the right page with external remember that php scripts are essentially compiled every time hit caching will be much more efficient at doing it will also force you to keep such rules fairly simple since can only use regular expressions a few other whereas in php you could potentially do anything doing database lookups to find the right not expressions usually just a case of my rewrite rules look like pretty basic

 so read and understood the following truths concerning web is for is for is for is normally all fine and and i find that when i strictly follow these guidelines and use external and it makes my entire site much much more i think i found a situation that breaks this line of have a custom forums system that built for one of my in addition to the usual formatting for such a system bold italics and allowed my users to set the formatting of their including font and all of this is saved in by database of forum messages as formatting and then translated to the corresponding html when the page is bit technically i should translate before but this way i can work on the system to the nature of this and other similar i end up with a lot of tags floating around the resulting html which i believe are unofficially deprecated since supposed to be using css for this breaks rules one and which state that html should not contain formatting preferring that information to be located in the css document there a way to achieve dynamic formatting in css without including that information in the is it worth the considering the implied limitations of proper an i to what my users can in order to follow the way to format my does the traditional is only for line of thought handle dynamic

 solution does not support a core business but a such as facilities where you are no different from your competitors processes will your internal development skills would be better used to create and maintain solutions that give your company a competitive former applies in spades if the solution does not need to be heavily integrated with your existing or future solutions supports a relatively isolated need to budget and staff for maintenance throughout the lifecycle of an developed the numbers but one figure seen and find quite believable is that the initial development costs of a custom application accounts for only the total lifecycle that includes stuff like upgrades and integration which also hits an externally procured but a 10x factor on the initial price tag will make most management take special case of the for maintenance and operations may be lacking or a bottleneck in your every skill shortage can be filled with enough time and but not necessarily within acceptable every additional technology skill your staff needs to acquire means less time to develop and maintain existing the skills cost of a diverse technical landscape grows at a more than linear peter but high costs can trump the risks of starting a development in a business where cost overrun is often considered a successful whereas unsuccessful projects have basically no vatine also commercial software can be had delayed only by installation and end user installation of something like sap done in a applies if your vendor is reasonably if they are small or have weak commercial software can be a much greater gamble than way you you get never free and seldom cheap to migrate away from an application that actually finds

 solution suggested by soulmerge is the and therefore best one you just need to nest the calls to i just want to add that the like will change nothing to the status if the searched string is not therefore you can safely apply it to all and since a condition where you search a string lost in the middle of another string cannot make any use of whatever index you useless as a filtering only filtering condition is the one on brings one point that justifies why solution is iterating on all the changes is a bad suppose that the filter on is moderately odds are that oracle will choose to scan the do you really want to scan the table each time when you can do all the changes in a single

 solution to this problem achieves a couple of but unfortunately there are plenty of other issues that it you are worried that the output array might not even have a valid terminated c string in then addressed that issue by inserting a by brute additionally chosen the optimal the last byte of the array be used for anything else if the array is supposed to hold a terminated done nothing to stop the called function trampling over memory beyond the array allocated for the number one thing be worried memory trampling buffer rocket but it does demand discipline and usually the basic idea involved is to never simply pass the address of some memory to be but instead to always accompany that address with the length of the memory block of course the called code must respect the limitation thus imposed on it looks like you know about the basic idea since you mention which is the classic example of this

 sql from occasionally results in a server is not under much load so the approach used is to lock as much as lock to prevent when multiple instances of an application calls this begin transaction check that no one has inserted the rows in t1 before and that t2 is in a valid state if not exists top 1 1 from t1 where fkid in and not top 1 1 from t2 where dbid in and test1 is not im the first go insert the row in t1 and update t2 finally write a log to t3 insert into select from t2 where dbid in update t2 set lastchangedby lastchangedat where dbid in insert into t3 select from t2 where dbid in select status on the rows so the program can evaluate what just select status from t1 where fkid in commit believe the problem is that multiple tables needs to be a bit unsure when the tables are actually xlocked when a table is used the first time or are all tables locked at one time at begin transaction when are table actually

 standard know this thingy used by but it says the type should have the natural size for a execution but even for 64 bit int is usually only 32 so in standard terms has pretty much no common meaning for the common english of size is the size of a depends on what character you talk character types are unsigned char and signed also is used to store characters that can have any size by the implementation but must use one of the integer types as its underlying much like while char or unsigned char has to have one that means that one byte has as much bits as one char if an implementation says one object of type char has 16 then a byte has 16 bits a byte is the size that one char a not some specific there is not much more about just that it is the unit that you can access you do not have pointer access to but you have access to units starting at one now is pretty what do you all of long and their unsinged counterparts are their range is what i would call and it is documented in the c standard taken over by the for signed char the range is from for short and int it is the same and is and for long it is their unsigned counterparts range from 0 up to and those are however minimal that an int may not have maximal size on any because that is less than of it follows for those values that a minimum of bits is for char that is for that is 16 and for long that is representation for negative numbers is not which is why the negative value is not instead of for example for signed

 stl algorithms are generally defined to work with iterators of various an iterator is defined by its it must be dereferenceable with it must be incrementable with and various other things that also define what sort of iterator it is most general is random remember that stl algorithms are so the question is one of a class instance with defined works syntactically just like a so they can be used pointer does everything needed to be a it is a and can be used as such in stl you could look at vector very likely to find that is a make an array a valid stl but it does make pointers valid stl

 system public class object internal static extern int public virtual int return is mapped to an function in the which looks like contractl dword idx if return objectref set up a frame idx return full implementation of is fairly so easier to just link to source expand on that a an excerpt from the default implementation returns an index for the object determined by the common language the index is unique to an instance of an object within an appdomain for an instance of the executing because this index can be reused after the object is reclaimed during garbage it is possible to obtain the same hash code for two different two objects that represent the same value have the same hash code only if they are the exact same implementation is not particularly useful for derived classes should override if not familiar with the clr source really no point in figuring out the exact because the best practice is to override	
 t is a pointer to the structure defined in the function you cannot have an access to it in make t global so that it can be accessed in the or pass the pointer as a argument to making it global is not the best in a multithreaded environment muiltiple threads may try to access it so u need to have some kind of locking mechanism to avoid access at the same adding the locking it functionality may lead to other overhead so the best choice should be to pass it as the

 technical answer to your original question is a qualified all objects opened from an are automatically disposed when the is in practice it is a good idea to dispose an as soon as done with it to reduce memory especially when working with code like this that opens several this behavior for linq is actually quite simple in you can find full details in but the short version is that a iterator can handle disposal for using my extension your code is relatively safe written like spsite var sw from spweb web in where from spweb subweb in select asubweb in do the result of your which assigned to is a lazy iterator of type as you enumerate over that each will be disposed when the enumerator moves to the next this means that it is not safe to use that or any object created from it outside of your also would not be safe to use outside of that block because the will be tied to the code like this that enumerates over all webs is extremely there is almost certainly a more efficient way that this could be if only by using instead of your garbage these objects require disposal because of unmanaged memory allocated that the gc even know a word of caution about your if using in your helper method to get your elevated there are a number of issues you could run into by returning your out of that elevated if i would suggest using impersonation instead my preferred method is described

 tends to confuse most profilers in that they sure how to count time that one thread is blocked waiting on another and time a thread is waiting around for work you using the thread are two profilers that you should check out in our has a free profiler that does code injection for it only works down to the method but does work on 64 bit and can give you a sense of where your time is the ant profiler is the best used for drilling into line level timings which is critical if you have a scenario where threads are blocked waiting on each other for a significant part of their execution if you can run your tests without a user interface i highly recommend setting up some nunit performance tests so you can quickly and easily repeat them exactly the same way each doing this you can see where your time is going even with a method level propose and check individual be surprised how taking time from one place just adds it to another because the threads end up waiting on each so having a perfectly repeatable test is very eqatech profiler modifies your compiled il so whenever you that il you get a new performance tracing so it should fit your command line i believe ant can work if your application is going to be used in multiple environments definitely recommend running a few performance test runs on a single processor or hyperthread only when you get very aggressive about tuning for multicores you can end up adding enough overhead that you may deadlock or just be slow on small numbers of

 the advantages of encapsulation so massive that i should go ahead and have getter getters and setter getters and so or should i take encapsulation in healthy measures and leave the field as a public encapsulation has nothing to do with wrapping a around a private in small or when writing the tradeoff is but when left unchecked in a system like the one its a an problem with is that they create overly tight coupling between the object with those methods and the rest of the of the advantages of real encapsulation is that it reduces the need for getters and decoupling your object from the rest of the system in the than exposing the implementation of gamecharacter with why not give gamecharacter an interface that better reflects role in the game instead class private intelligence public intelligence return public void not try better class public void todo update public int even still interface public void might update public int class ogre implements never increases intelligence after grabbing other a gamecharacter can grab the effect of each gamecharacter grabbing the same gameobject can but the details are fully encapsulated within each gamecharacter how the gamecharacter is now in charge of handling its own intelligence update which can happen as it grabs for the setter the complications you note with having have you might be able to dispense with the getintelligence method depending on the allen holub takes this idea to its but but that approach seem to be very

 the an inline box contains an the inline box its inline ancestors within the same line are broken around the box any siblings that are consecutive or separated only by collapsible whitespace splitting the inline box into two boxes if either side is one on each side of the the line boxes before the break and after the break are enclosed in anonymous block and the box becomes a sibling of those anonymous when such an inline box is affected by relative any resulting translation also affects the box contained in the inline model would apply in the following example if the following inline block used with this html html public html text interrupted by a this is anonymous text before the is the content of this is anonymous text after the p element contains a chunk of anonymous text followed by a element followed by another chunk of anonymous the resulting boxes would be a block box representing the containing an anonymous block box around the span block and another anonymous block box around properties of anonymous boxes are inherited from the enclosing box in the example just below the subsection heading block the one for properties have their initial for the font of the anonymous box is inherited from the but the margins will be set on elements that cause anonymous block boxes to be generated still apply to the boxes and content of that for if a border had been set on the p element in the above the border would be drawn around c1 at the end of the and c2 at the start of the user agents have implemented borders on inlines containing blocks in other by wrapping such nested blocks inside line and thus drawing inline borders around such as css1 and css2 did not define this and user agents may implement this alternative model and still claim conformance to this part of css this does not apply to uas developed after this specification was of that what you clearly the behaviour is specified in although whether it covers all or is implemented consistently across browsers is

 the answer below is only valid for java ee as was brought to my attention in one of the other java ee 6 does support so if using java ee read this but read the other relevant my own research and from the responses to this question the answer i found is the although jaas is a standard there is no uniform way to deploy and integrate a jaas realm loginmodule in various application v2 requires you to extend some of its own internal classes that implement loginmodule or realm you can however not customize the whole login process because many methods of the loginmodule interface are marked final in the custom loginmodule and realm classes must be placed in the as classpath the and the realm must be manually registered deployment from the situation seems to be a bit better for which will let you code your own realm and loginmodule and then configure them into the application server using its own jaasrealm will delegate the actual work to your implementations of realm and even tomcat allow deploying your custom realm from your that none of the application servers that showed up my results seem to be able to take full advantage of all the jaas all of them seem to only support the basic if you need anything more complicated than then you will need to find a solution that is not managed by your java ee and because it was asked for in the comments to my here is the code i wrote for of the realm class webservicerealm extends appservrealm static final logger log string string int string void throws nosuchrealmexception webservice realm read the configuration properties from the use reasonable default values if not string configport port configport using default port string return enumeration throws nosuchuserexception list groupnames new return string return webservice string return int return string return then the loginmodule class webserviceloginmodule extends appservpasswordloginmodule all variables starting with are supplied by the and must be in void throws loginexception if null throw new and password cannot be groups must be called as last operation of the login boolean throws loginexception if return fetch some more information through the return webserviceclient return in the realm has to be tied to the this is done at the jaas configuration file which in glassfish v2 lies at add the following lines at the end of that use whatever string is returned from you is what got things working for me on this solution is not portable across application but as far as i can there is no existing portable

 the answer to your question is probably there are lots of reasons to avoid throwing exceptions whenever but memory really a real reason to only throw exceptions for truly exceptional conditions is that generating an exception involves carefully examining the not a fast operation at if doing it as part of your regularly flow of it will noticeably affect your i once wrote a logging system that i thought was extremely clever because it automatically figured out which class had invoked it by generating an exception and examining the stack in that eventually i had to go back and take that part out because it was noticeably slowing everything else	
 the answer you get will be off by a certain i have never heard of a timer function compensating for the average return because such a thing is nearly impossible to predict such things are usually implemented by simply reading a register in the hardware and returning the or a version of it scaled to the appropriate i lose sleep over the accepted way of keeping this overhead from affecting your measurements in any significant way is to use these timers for short you will time several or million executions of the same and divide by the number of executions to estimate the average such a thing is usually more useful than timing a single as it takes into account average cache os and so	
 the answers gotten so far are but respond to your update am set on using neural networks as the main aspect on the project is to test how the nn approach would work for spam then you have a an empirical test like this prove probably best off learning a bit about what nn actually do and to see why they are not a particularly good idea for this sort of classification probably a helpful way to think about them is as universal function but for some idea of how this all fits together in the area of classification is what the spam filtering problem browsing an intro text like might be that if you are dead set on seeing it just use any general nn library for the network most of your issue is going to be how to represent the input data the structure is and it probably matter that the inputs are going to have to be a number of measurements on the corpus some are obvious of some much less this is the part you can really play around but you should expect to do poorly compared to bayesian filters have their own problems due to the nature of the	
 the answers so far assume that in the first line of the second example is the instance variable behind the this is the default the that the first line assigns to is a local then the property is and you will leak the object unless you release it later in the is an instance but the property is actually backed by a different instance or no instance variable at then you are writing code and it may be a echoing the previous if is the instance variable backing the then this is not a since the method that you call in the second line will release the object that you put in the instance variable in the first

 the array is a specific size and all regular integers in your why not just use a simple integer for assume this is an instance variable of type nsinteger myarray do any other initialization that you return do whatever you objects your requirements call for a array all consisting of the primitive i think that the simple solutions are if the length of the array will never change you know the length at compile you can use an nsinteger array as your instance variable instead of a that way you have to deal with allocating the memory or freeing in that you will get a out array

 the author of one of the features gitx has is the visualization of as can be seen visualization is currently done by reading commits which are emitted from git in the correct for each commit the parents are so fairly easy to build up the lanes in the correct like to speed up this process by using my own commit pool and linearizing the commits this allows me to reuse existing loaded commits and allows git to emit commits faster because it have to emit them in the correct not sure what algorithm to use to accomplish it is important that the building is as the loading of commits can take a long time seconds for which should all be has gone the same and a patch that shows how it is but my tcl skills are weak and the patch very thoroughly commented and a bit hard to also like this algorithm to be as have to handle hundreds of thousands of it also has to be displayed in a so important that access to specific rows is describe the input i have so the output that i want and a few have a current pool of commits in the form of a hash table that maps commit ids to commit this pool does not have to be complete all commits have a separate thread loading in new commits from with a callback that can be called every time a new commit is there is no guaranteed order in which the commits come but in most of the cases the next commit is a parent of the previous commit object has its own revision id and the revision ids of all its have a list of branch heads that should be that there a single of the dag that should be there also does not have to be a single graph need to linearize these commits in topological that a commit cannot be listed after its parents have been also need the that can be seen in the screenshot these probably need to be precomputed as most of them depend on their few necessary to relocate a list of for we might have to commits that are until a commit shows up which makes one head an ancestor of the branch tips must be important that this process is so that at least a partial view is available while the data is still this means that new data has to be inserted halfway and that the branch lines have to be hope i have described the problem clear enough linearizing of git

 there are some very important concepts that are shoved in your face particularly in c that you have to deal say take it a step further and learn never programmed professionally in any assembly but the time i spent working through every chapter and exercise in langauge for the has payed the most dividends of any of my school or you will know what a pointer and an offset have a deeper understanding of why character encoding know about the stack and the memory you may never use any of that but it will make yo u a better	
 there are two ways of defining a regex in through a regexp object re new using a string re should also note that js does not support some of the tenets of regular for a list of features unsupported in check out the you appear to be setting some flags on the expression the case insensitive i would suggest that you use the flag indicated by the syntax instead of using would make your regex as follows lookahead appears to be a very good article on the check out expressions in you are simply assigning this regex pattern to a regularexpressionvalidator then you will not have the ability to set regex options as ignore you will not be able to use the regex literal syntax supported by the only option that remains is to make your pattern intrinsically case for would have to be written as this would make your regex quite sorry to is a to this though i cannot vouch for some other options that come to mind may be to turn of client side validation altogether and validate exclusively on the this will give you access to the full regex flavour implemented by the use a customvalidator and create your own js function which applies the regex match using the patterns that i have	
 there at all support in erlang for making a single parallel app run on distributed processor but it depends on how you designed your an distributable erlang application is actually built from a number of independent processes that communicate with each other via the messaging in order to perform

 there is a way to find what the default browser you will have to use the query would version you would query firefoxhtml whatever value was using the same and append the following to the query this would version you can parse the returned lines to grab the location of the browser can do all this using the java runtime requires a lot of customized but you could essentially create your own api to access the default browser under is an example of accessing the windows registry in could also search google for more information on finding default browser in the for other platforms i am sure there is a specific way to get the path to the default this

 there is no way to constrain a generic parameter to be an integral type i guess might be a better word as this does not pertain to just would be nice to be able to do something like t integral or depending on how pedantic you t would suggest that you read by our very own marc gravell and jon it explains why this is such a difficult problem and what can be done to work around introduced generics into which opened the door many elegant solutions to generic constraints can used to restrict the known interfaces to ensure to functionality or for tests singletons implement icomparer iequalitycomparer us to sort elements without having to anything about the in all there is a big gap when it comes to because operators are declared static there is no or similar equivalent interface all the numeric types the flexibility of would make this very hard to do in meaningful of operators on primitive types even exist as instead are direct il to make situation even more demands the concept where the describes the operators to the nullable type but this implemented as a language is not provided by the runtime reflection even more

 there then simply include the referrer as one of the that you capture and send back with the redirection the referrer probably available on the client so it will work like sends initial presumably including a dynamically generates the including the referrer in a javascript collects client including the referrer value stored in step sends collected attributes to server with new redirection records referrer parameter although not in the http logs since the referer header have the same value as what the javascript request you realize none of this is reliable anyway because it all depends on the client including the referer header in step and no guarantee that will or if it does that the value you get is i also question the wisdom of doing checks of something as arbitrary as window to determine the validity of a navigation	
 there to be overloaded if you feel the for all predefined types essentially a practical uses of a unary arithmetic operator are pretty and tend to relate to the consequences of using a value in an arithmetic rather than the operator for it can be used to force widening from smaller integral types to or ensure that an result is treated as an rvalue and therefore not compatible with a reference i that these uses are better suited to code golf than

 theres not a whole lot of difference there is very little one can do that the other but the configs tend to differ most obvious difference is that oracle uses sequences and sql server uses there are pros and cons to some prefer one over the my experience doing top n queries in sql server seems a little easier than of the box oracle uses mvcc data is to reads by other database maintains a consistent sql server i only discovered recently has this too but not the default option and is called something quite transaction isolation level or and are reasonably different in syntax in some areas but the concepts are mostly the i found sql server management studio to be ok but horrendous in some like its data just work with auto increment primary this was a known bug going back years on sql server i know if fixed it in 2008 or with developer ship as part of a separate commercial imports and exports were a has an annoying limit on limited to 4k in much longer in sql server found the sql server security model just tcp was disabled by default authentication and then you had to setup a logon and a i never quite got it just seemed to be to be overly complicated whereas in oracle its user blah identified by connect to granting some other like resource is pretty never quite figured out the from the managemen recover would fail saying someone was connected to the database but that someone was me attempting to run the before anyone has a go at me for the i realize fully well that many of them stem from my lack of sql server experience but honestly theres still a level of consistency the and portability of concepts that is

 thing i see mentioned is that the library is written to work cross browser on a wide range of popular browsers and firefox safari alone is reason enough to use jquery then to write your own javascript and have to worry about cross browser issues	
 thing i seen mentioned in the other answers is someone else is going to have to maintain your if all have a rougher time of it than if a more standard library is if not of any concern to and you think likely to need any of the really slick jquery then keep on with what	
 thing left i think is to use windbg to try and debug here are some links on how to use blog about debugging in general in about it could also be some service or something try stopping all unneeded services and closing unneeded programs startup and see what happens	
 thing that helped me was to just find a good mentor in the look for someone who is really knowledgeable in the and who is willing to spend some time with you every if the documentation is bad or probably have the best luck just talking to the people who know the than just read as much documentation as you and try to relate what reading to the	
 thing that helps a lot is to find a good balance between focussing and not sure you can work on the bug without being also know when to take a break if you cannot concentrate any there is a point where a good night of sleep is the best you can discuss the problem with a often a second pair of eyes and point of view work	
 thing that jumps out at me with this why are you using ints instead of a class to represent true this is a simple but a piece class seems to jump out as a fairly obvious class to with int you really have 3 presumably something you should check for 0 before bothering to check for if they are the same it will be quicker really cares this need to be and make more logical sense the square if so then do not bother checking if the squares hold the same for simple things like especially when you are just starting try to embrace it is a different way of and it takes so practice as much as you	
 thing that should mentioned is that it often pays to put a class containing extension methods in its own so that you can enable or disable those extension methods with a so if the thing in the namespace is a static class containing extension the answer is	
 thing to be aware of is that two web apps will use different if you want to share they need to use the same version of the class from the same classloader else you will get that means either putting them in a classloader shared by both web apps classpath for or using serialization to effectively drain and reconstitute the object in the right classloader with the correct version of the

 think a better way to handle this would be using the to decorate your controller a base this would give you the option to do logging or handle errors in different controllers with different errors by extending this attribute and modifying it to fit your say by changing the view that gets using this attribute uses the standard filter processing in mvc and builds the page using views rather than writing directly to the response as you might do using

 think a right or wrong answer so give you my either solution the account controller or creating a new will work just i think this is more a question of how the users perceive the i think a good idea to follow the convention that the uri dictates the controller vice if you for like to have the actions on a separate then that should be a separate you might want to do for if you use an iis module for authentication or if it makes your log analysis the other it might be the case that the users perceive account functions and administrative functions as part of the same family of except that some users have additional if then that suggests that should be on the same path in the uri part of the same i think this is a question you should ask your user representative instead of folks on this regarding your updated i would say that it is fairly natural to put an action for changing a password on the account and that action could be invoked by the user not just an so i presume that the account controller is strictly for administrative on the other your example of the performance is well outside of the scope of so it is not clear that it belongs on still leaning your user	
 think a separate app to do the watchdogging is likely to produce more problems than it suggest that you first create handlers to generate minidumps when the app then add a watchdog thread to the which will deliberately crash if the app goes off the the advantage to the watchdog thread a different is that it should be easier for the watchdog to know for sure that the app has gone off the you have the you can poke around to find out the state when it this should give you enough clues to figure out the or at least where to look some stuff at codeproject about which could be a useful msdn has more information about them as

 think all qa is developers must test their own code to ensure it does what he thinks it should do and it break the testers should test against the specifications to see if the developer interpreted them correctly testing almost never finds these peers should do code reviews to ensure that standards are followed and to promote users must do testing as well as they will try to do things that nobody expected or defined in the often these are stupid things that make us shake out heads and would anyone every think to do but many others are genuine requirements that were not in the spec because nobody bothered to ask the users what they client acceptance testing should be done especially if you do custom development for different it is far easier to show that a new request for work is new development rather than a if the client has signed off on the work before it went to this can save tons of contractual battles over who is to pay for having someone else fix your bad code is the best way to ensure that bad code will continue to be produced which why i hate the organizational structure that some companies have of having developers who do new things and support people who do further a manager who fixes bad code to save time without sending it back to the developer to fix is causing problems for the organization not fixing big part of qa in my mind is taking the time up front to actually define the requirements and they will change through any large but they still are without testing is random at without standards maintenance can become a nightmare and far more costly than need last part of qa is learning from our unfortunately in many organizations you honestly have a post project discussion of what went wrong and how to prevent that next time without getting into a blame session that causes people be quiet rather than get bad marks against them for their performance in fact performance appraisals in general are harmful to the goal of improving quality for this reason among many up deming and total quality management to see the quality thoughts on the harm caused by performance theory there should be quality metrics that you can use to measure imporved in practice as long as your organization has performance these numbers will often be to make things look better or measure the worng thing lines of code mean better code in all cases and more bug reports might mean we are doing a better job of finding at least the bugs not that the code is worse than in a past and are thus	
 think allows launching a process on a remote so wmi or shelling to something like psexec may be your only options wcf is the way to avoid it offers no benefits for the general is no longer being and is deprecated in favour of wcf for a variety of reasons distributed objects become a pain in the neck due to versioning and state messaging is usually easier to set understand and also remoting had no security if i remember for setting this when the parent process spawns the remote it could pass a url as a command line the parent hosts a wcf service on that now if the spawned process needs to communicate back to subscribe to the parent it just connects to the url it was if the parent needs to initiate then make the wcf service or have the spawned process host its own wcf and tell the parent the url via the	
 think already done the thin controller thing by putting the query into a named scope where it can be here is some code i used before i started using named def describe to get it expose all comms as get would probably write code quite similar to what you have but maybe put it in a helper that allows me to reuse the other thing is to use a different mocking framework that maybe gives you more have a look at ryan railscast on rspec a bit old now but still some good ideas in	
 think an easy way to get just the last part from the current path in just batch if you have on your it becomes relatively in sed do dir is apparently with the extensions to batch this is now understand the as you need sed and this reduces in do dir since you change you need the in the output path or the dir and you should just be able to substitute for the so you can try

 think asking how to make udp reliable may be approaching the question the wrong udp is unreliable more or less by definition ipso you going to get anywhere making the implementation of the protocol more great many applications that use udp use it because they need the nature of it much more than they need the precise reliability of but almost all of these applications still need some mechanism for verifying receipt of certain types of and perhaps even reassembly initial think about sip in voip for latent handshake and very gradual congestion control really acceptable for decent call setup time or but some way of acknowledging messages is definitely needed what provisional responses are in sip or various protocols in use by online games same basic is very likely that the real intent of the assignment even if is not stated clearly is not so much to make reliable as to create a simple program that udp has some primitive reliability abstraction layer within its own communication encapsulated in udp as it	
 think be better off an open source imap there are several out but i am not sure if the mail server idea is a good be bringing a lot of baggage into this you just send your daughter an as opposed to putting the assignment on a web page and then trying to get it off of you must have the pull model opposed to a push why not put up an asp page with a me the she can go click on and will receive the content in the

 think commented code in a source code control system should be done with extreme especially if the language tags used to comment the code are written by my commented code start commented code line commented code line than on an individual line my commented code start my commented code line my commented code line get the reason i would use extreme caution is that depending of the you should be very careful about the tool you are with certain source code control system and certain the tool can be easily the standard of clearcase for example is notoriously bad for merging it happens that the commenting blocks lines are not merge presto your code will become active in the system when it if the code is incomplete and break the that is probably the least as you will spot it if the code passes the it may become active when it be and from a cm that could be a nightmare qa generally test what should be they test for code that is not supposed to be so your code may end up in production before you know and by the time it would be realized the code is there when it the cost in maintenance have multiplied many folds the will be discovered in production or by the worst place or time	
 think custom serialization and iserializable interface will be the most efficient way in your check out the sample also a good discussion thread towards both iserializable and serialization attributes would say that if you want to have a full control over the format you should use custom serializer and if you want responding the flow the attributes is the best	
 think entity framework since is a great choice as it pretty much abstracts away sql with its entity sql	
 think enums were made this way as opposed to what you want to meant to hold any meaningful numerical enums are perfect for describing the else in color can be represented by complex types but indulge me for the how about think you get the bottomline enumerations were meant to represent objects or object characteristics that are difficult to represent or do not have meaningful or practical numerical representations and thus the arbitrary assignment to an integer which is the most convenient data type for is as opposed to things like which are

 think every table needs a primary sometimes you only want to the contents of two tables via primary you have a table like and one table like with primary and you have a third table called with only two colums and where users and groups are connected with each example a row with user 3 and group 6 would link the user with primary key 3 to the group with primary key

 think generally not considered a good idea to call for the value reading out of what about the value is what about the value cannot be do you have any exception handling code sure the value is not the value can be parsed before call consider use a nullable type like in this	
 think got more problems than just the dot not matching but let me start with a formatting you can use just about any punctuation character as the regex not just the slash if you use another you have to escape slashes within the i understand is popular among that would make your pattern the reason that regex work as you intended is because the dot loses its special meaning when it appears inside a character class square just matches a dot or a what you were looking for was but i would have recommended matching the as well as the because the word can refer to the or any given web page may contain any of those or a mixture of two or more a mix of and is very but with mode known as or dotall you need to worry about another problem with the original regex still present in this the is that if more than one sequence in the the first time your regex is applied it will match all of from the first to the last the simplest way to fix that is to make the ungreedy or by appending a question i know what to make of the before the opening quote of your pattern i do but that looks like a syntax error to if someone could educate me in this appreciate	
 think has the words of concentrate on the identify and deliver then move on to the next and the this is called and incremental response to the weaknesses of the waterfall will also allow you to create tools and frameworks which should make your development easier and faster as you move will allow you to show your clients functional parts but a word of your client will more than likely keep changing its changing the changing its seen entire projects fail due to these continuous it is out of the scope of this question to mention any more on but please be aware that it more than likely will happen and be prepared to deal with you and the client have functional they can be tested immediately rather than testing one huge completing functional parts iteratively will probably allow you to work at every on most using most tools and the advantage of this is that it will allow you to identify the complexities it is those complex areas that render this following statement first of the code accounts the first of the development the remaining of the code for the other of the acknowledging and understanding those complex areas will allow you to manage your risks and alter your efforts and resources more

 think i can do simple program in python faster than in those python scripts work really course your question without examples is hard to maybe you have found slow bug give us more details	
 think i found a solution to this it sadly involves a temporary but at least prevent the creation of a dreaded cursor you need to do is add an extra column to the table duplicating records from and give it a declare a temporary table the the data into your temp table like into from go ahead and do the real insert into the original into uniqueid from to add the newly created identity values to your temp originaltable o inner join tmp on you have a lookup table that holds the new id and original id in one for your using pleasure hope this helps	
 think i read somewhere recently even have been on so but i find the that in a debug pressing stop in vs just kills the process and no gc takes however closing the app window normally performs gc as this what happens when a process is killed in task manager does the gc still the gc still clean up if you end process in task

 think it is to assume that it is a i perfectly write my own and your implementation would choke on breaking the whole point of you also just change the api to accept explicit implementation to support since i could be using the interface rather than the visitor new you want optional support for something from the then you are going to have to use to detect anything else and you are breaking the	
 think it is worth knowing and there are reasons to choose close to the whole stack is sometimes you need to debug sometimes you cannot fix a performance problem without knowledge is often the when the performance problem is purely but it is widely considered the quintessential of the and not some other i think this because c is a programming it has been a while but c was not always as to take just one famous the proponents of common lisp had its own ways of writing were hoping their language would be and eventually following are usually implemented in systems many embedded operating programming languages popular implementations of reams of popular open source not a hardware but i gather that c has influenced cpu design if you believe in understanding the whole learning c from a pragmatic the best a i think worth learning as although c is close to the i fully understand c until i had to do some it is occasionally helpful to understand how functions calls are actually how loops are less but also is having to least deal with a system without virtual when using c on and certain other operating even humble does a lot of work under the covers that is easier to debug tune if ever had to deal with manually locking and unlocking memory regions that i would recommend doing so on a regular	
 think it might actually be a syntax the syntax for pointers seems inconsistent and more complex than it needs to the thing that actually helped me to understand pointers was encountering the concept of an iterator in the template ironic because i can only assume that iterators were conceived as a generalization of the you just see the forest until you learn to ignore the

 think mark brittingham has the right idea which is to issue a command and write the sp to not fully qualify the table as he this will act on tables in the current me add a few possible a comment by the i gather the database is changed once a when it gets have to load data into a new database each month or else it gets too logins have a default set with or alter if each month you move on to the new and need to run the sp on the older just change the default db and fully qualify the table database to use can be set in the client password then exec the sp from can establish a connection to the database using the client of your choice then issue a the exec the database the database has been set using one of the you have three choices for executing the stored could just copy the sp along with the in to the new as long as the table name is not fully operate on the new could install the single canonical copy of the sp in its own call it with the tablename not fully and then call its fuly qualified in each individual install a stub that execs the fully qualified name of the real and then exec without qualifying the stub will be and it will call the real procedure in database cannot be executed from within an proc exec this is if the database is being the real sp should be created with the otherwise cache an execution plan for the wrong the stub of course need

 think most people are missing the point of it looks to me like asking about what inheritance is asking about subclasses implementing functionality that is not a natural fit for a base and the resulting mess that can the pushing of specific methods functionality up the hierarchy or requiring that subclasses implement a contract for functionality that a natural is also the matter of whether it is valuable to be able to treat a base class like the subclass in every case avoid casting and use them this is called the liskov substitution principle for reminding

 think of any particular way other than sendkeys to do exactly what you asked take his warnings to sendkeys is very tricky to do possibility to get the same end result is to change your to accept get variables and its fields on you might have 3 variables that populate the company and in vba create a form or sheet that a user can fill out var1 obviously make your var names nicer than mine myurl myurl myurl have a as use something similar for help pages called via a menu and it works a a user clicks a menu and vba opens a url with some data in the favourite only other way interacted with a website from vba programatically is by making calls to directly for get and post though think it would help in your last if you want to stop people gaming your site your should encrypt your not to hard to encrypt then uuencode the data and send that as a request then just urldecode it and decrypt it on the server using the same algorythm you used to encrypt

 think one issue is the number of choices design of everyday says that usability is increased by having few and clear choices limiting the choices a specification increases usability for the envisioned task and but this necessarily decreases flexibility in i think doet a little with the example a push the door already one the idea of an affordance is to make it clear which way it the limitation comes first and the clarity comes the limitation has more to do with and because each time the door opens we anticipate where it swings and security because it can be reinforced in a chosen direction for barring really think we limit choices so that we know how do open a because we make them swing if we thus once the limits have been established that the push plate makes it clear what you have to do on your side of the	
 think one of the best qualities of sof is that the more you immerse yourself in the community of sof the more reputation you build and the more rights you with the additional rights you can further influence the community as a and hopefully make it your first focus should be to create a site that people want to be part and then as they do good things for the make sure the site does good things for on a symbiotic relationship

 think submodules are the way to go when it comes to is how you should use just a you develop both main project and within the same directory is called a you tag and merge the all to view your as a is a branch which allows you to access a version of a vendor external component or of and which is only updated with the new version every release of that external that is called a the all system is viewed as a collection of separate components developed on their two approaches are not first strategy is compatible with a you are working both on project and second one is used with but submodules is used to define a of tag you need to each git unlike are pinned to a particular commit and that is what allows you to define a in like the second approach because most of the when you have a project and a their is different are not developed at the same not tagged together at the same nor with the same really prevents that approach in your question is the can be developed and updated from the same working would really urge you to reconsider that as most ide are perfectly capable to deals with multiple and the development can be done in its own dedicated an emap plugin for both joomla and both the plugin and the code is part of not of are developed while the plugin is inside all paths are the structure is and they must be distributed together even though each project has its own i understand you are in a configuration where the development environment set of files you are working is quite the same than the distribution environment same set of file is copied on the release all comes done to a granularity both sets of files cannot exist one without the then they should be viewed as one big project but that force them to be tagged and merged as one depends on the other can be developed then they should be in their own git repository and the first one depending on a specific commit of the second as a if the is defined in the right subtree of the first all relative paths are original thread listed issues with submodules primarily that download include them to and that they get stuck on a particular am not sure download is an issue that developing with article does of people cloning your fork will have no problem pulling down your as registered the public clone url for the the gh submodule gh submodule pull the submodules into the current for the get stuck on a particular that is the all point of a allowing you to work with a of tagged version of instead of a latest potentially unstable set of need to avoid both subtrees and submodules and would rather address this need without arguing too much if the approach is requirement is a perfectly legitimate and i do not want to judge its my previous answers are only here to provide a larger context and try to illustrate the options usually available with a generic scm merge should be the answer but would imply to merge back only commits made for files for the main and not commits made for the if you can manage that kind of partial i would reckon it is the right path to do not see however a native git way to do what you want that does not use or hope a true git guru will post here a more adequate	
 think such support exists in current i think what i want to do could be solved by a but the problem i have with is generally they and i find a imperative style much more have a lot of simple though diverse little state investigated iterators in but that get me exactly where i want to current looking at putting together a dsl in but not sure if be able to get behaviour into and be able to serialize it as is limited fictional example of what like to the main issue is that at any point in a routine you may need to get user the time between inputs could be very long so the state of service will need to be serialized to def var lever var device def var color var shape return have a working in it on the support in so code looks like roll yield if roll can be with some user however serialize the whole state of the game can be defined as a sequence of i serialize the game state up to the point at where a coroutine started then the remaining list of so to looks like if return return state if is return r for input in return still find this as i end up having to use on almost every rather not have to specifically decorate a also it quite fails at investigating going a functional as functional languages seem to have better support for currently looking computational hopeful that with strong enough metaprogramming facilities i can automate the state storage if i go the pretty sure i can fall back on the i used to serialize that supports serializing	
 think that code needs to first and readable and optimisations that are should not be at the expense of optimisation is often a or not you should optimise your code depends on your application if you are working on an embedded processor with only 8mb of then optimisation is probably something that every team member needs to keep in when writing code optimising for space vs optimisation is not useful unless your system has been clearly and this is because most programmers do not make good optimisation decisions unless they can factor in the influence of the overall including processor architectural factors such as cache hardware

 think that the best approach is to go to the official java and skim it and just stop at everything that looks unfamiliar and read more most tutorials are aimed at people who never developed but imho the sun one is fairly useful even for people who do understand would also recommend reading a tutorial or a difference for short summary of differences with code think that eclipse is a good ide and should be straightforward to a word of if you decide to use a book on make sure that it is updated to java 5 and in the early days java missed support for generics and that made everything incredibly special attention to the tutorial chapters about the collections framework and the java threading wait with the other apis guis with also be aware that the java library is somewhat as you you may want to take a look at the apache commons project for many things that the main library is

 think that you need to step back and think about what a or associative really all it is is a way to store a value for a given and get that value back quickly and you may also want to be able to iterate over the keys to retrieve every key value or delete keys and their associated think about a data structure you use all the time in shell and even just in the shell without writing a that has these the all you need to have an associative array in shell programming is a temp is your associative array you feel like using and you can always write some little these ones are modelled off of though they just output the value rather than setting arbitrary variables like 3 exit mkdir echo 2 exit cat own this approach is actually quite a bit faster than the linear search using sed suggested by the as well as more robust allows keys and values to contain qnd the fact that it uses the filesystem does not make it these files are actually never guaranteed to be written to the disk unless you call for temporary files like this with a short not unlikely that many of them will never be written to did a few benchmarks of modification of and my using the following driver fix broken stack overflow syntax i 0 i 1 for j 0 j 1 put get time irfan 10 real user sys time brian 10 real user sys time jerry 10 real user sys time irfan 100 real user sys time brian 100 real user sys time jerry 100 real user sys time irfan 10 real user sys time brian 10 real user sys time jerry 10 real user sys time irfan 1000 real user sys time brian 1000 real user sys time jerry 1000 real user sys

 think the best way to achieve this is to rely on the fact that according to the ieee 754 floating point the integer representation of floating point bits are lexicographically ordered as a you could simply add one ulp in the last to get the next floating point representation will always be slightly larger than your treshold if it was since the round error is at most float floatvalue floatvalue int asint asint floatvalue floatvalue my know when you need to add one have to rely on the difference of and a rounded if int asint asint floatvalue correctly convert to but leave that the float gets promoted to a double via the multiplication with before the is you do this you risk getting in the situation that in float representation would be

 think the main issue you have to watch out for is upgrading once you upgrade to a new version of visual you will be forced to upgrade your project files as once the upgrade is complete the file will no longer be compatible with previous versions of visual this means that you will break anyone who is using the previous version of vs to the best advise is to upgrade the entire best way to work around this is to keep 2 versions of the project file one for the previous version of visual studio and the other for the this obviously has a bit of and once you actually start using new language features this will no longer be a sufficient as the new features likely compile in the old versions of visual	
 think the most important practice in ensuring that your scripts are is them against a test database multiple times after any changes to the the errors you encounter should shape your response to your edit on in general i think it is best to avoid the system tables in favor of the system views 1 from where drop 1 from where drop

 think there is a best if you have the time to code up menus and high score tables in opengl the you have a lot more flexibility you could for example have a 3d animation going on in the you code high score using standard uikit views and switch out the opengl view while they are shown then this has the advantage that very quick to code if you took the time to learn to use interface but it is inherently even though you can still use custom button graphics and fonts to make it look less like a business still going to look less polished compared to other games in the app you want to do is to layer a transparent uiview over the top of you opengl view this will be very personally use interface builder generated views to get stuff like menus in while building the rest of the the intention is to replace that with opengl animated code in the end really down to how much time you have

 think this is a the safety mechanism that exist in winforms throws an exception if in the debugger and you try to access the ui from a thread other than the appropriate you sure that the event being called that sounds extremely if you put a breakpoint on the event handler in the does that break point not get answer your question in a different way i make the entire event handler execute on a specific there may be more than one handler and those handlers may need to execute on different i would make the event handlers themselves code them so that if they need to perform some action on a particular they do the marshalling back to the thread with thread is most of your network access taking place i would hope not of the ui threads involved otherwise you can get an unresponsive that would mean that if it was working probably already doing the appropriate very none of this could you try to come up with a short but complete program which demonstrates the easier to diagnose concrete code

 think what used in the past was the functions mainly centering around the and increasing a count with the and then the end is a bit tricky because of the session if you are not concerned a lot with how exactly accurate the count is then you can stop not then probably use a combination of the javascript onunload event with some sort of ajax request to invalidate the session and subtract the the event would have to see if the user was actually leaving the page or just going to another page on the start i remember having to do with asp sites so there is definately some information out there on this	
 think what you have is just a simple relational where the main relation is the particular data structure here is and you might want to do transitive queries of descendant of which are not usually supported by standard sql if you want to do it in you could us a directed acyclic graph	
 think what you need is navigation should have a navigation controller that has your rss reader as root view then whenever a user selects a story in your rss create an instance of a new view controller that has a webview as you can then pass the url to the new web view and the webview onto your navigation you have to do then is tell the webview to load the url you passed and do its when the user is all they have to do is hit the back button that gets created for you by the navigation

 think you could be trying something like from where assuming trip as the code above will raise error if is not a so you would be using or something in the check the then way you be raising error if the reader has problems reading testing check first this from where then from will get you the rows that satisfy your the second will get you the total row count for the that way you can be sure whether the problem is the reader or the data source	
 think you did anything valid in you can double check by seeing if this evaluates as arraycount

 think you should consider a bit of in do as the romans has properties ingrained into all of designers and code it is almost an inseperable part of the if you choose to use accessors instead of normal properties you will be creating a library which has a very different appearance than what every other programmer is accessors will only increase the chances that you create code which is incompatible with various for there are many tools out there which special case properties and fields and provide special features for you will have an equivalent construct but no tool

 this intended for of the video editors seen will each frame by storing each frame into its own image are you stuck with using this storage it would be significantly more efficient if the source videos were stored in a video format already per and there was an index for each video the file offsets for each then you can use the operating caching mechanism to help improve your thing you may want to although it probably help much with networked is to store the images in yuv your application which displays the videos might run faster because the conversion and often because you can offload the work of drawing the yuv image to the video thus leaving more time for the filesystem i do this when drawing onto an x display just to avoid far as caching the i would probably use a separate thread to read the images from disk as fast as you can while the main thread assembles and presents the the main thread can do its loop once per frame presentation and the separate thread can block when the amount of images reaches a certain video players like mplayer use such

 this is an issue between the browser and the flash as sifr inserts the flash movies into the the browser initializes the flash plugin with the path to the flash if the movie is not yet in a local requested from the since the movies are inserted within a few this would mean that a request is made for each inserted tries to prevent this by prefetching the flash it does this ones per browser based on a session this merely fires off a request for the movie and hopefully that file is in the cache by the time replacement therefore its important to load the sifr javascript code as early as and to activate sifr properly by passing the flash movies to the my experience the only way to reliably test this process is clearing browser closing all browser instances get rid of the session then opening the browser and going straight to the page you want to i find the activity monitors within browsers so either check through an http proxy or the server one remaining improvement i could make is to try and detect the progress of the and hold off on replacing elements until the prefetch is

 this is obviously as for you could look at it from both on one the scope of anything in code should be as small as on the other you could say that a constant is more likely to be used troughout a class and should therefor be declared at the class level at all to prevent double would declare class level constants only and use method constants only when there is a good reason for reason could be that a methods purpose is to provide abstraction on some api call and you require some constant values for in this case you want class level constants to clutter the rest of a

 this might be an overkill for a small but more this could be a nightmare to maintain when there are changing features and documents are constantly this can be very hard to the way it happend on a couple of very large projects where i worked to this kind of quality level was to be extremely harsh on adding new requirements to the current work this means that the requirements stay stable and it is not too hard to keep all the acceptance test in it is still a full time job for several admin staff and a daily overhead for every engineer i am talking here about loc requirements are only admited after rather lengthy the process is basically there to make the customer think very hard about adding a new requirement to the current adding requirements to future versions is but to add one to the current phase is there is a fixed fee payable just to a requirement and get it read by an architect and presented to a change control once this is done a quote is given to the customer if the new req is complex the quote may be just for further investigation and not even a commitment to implement the it is then up to the customer to decide whether or not to and if they do then the team undertakes to do the work and adds the req to the fixes the adds new test and so the schedule may also need to be adjusted at this approach might not sound commercialy feasible if your organisation needs to be open to new if this is the case then you can still have tracking and a managable level of overhead if you go for frequent that way your current version stays stable as you work on it and you can keep the matrix and docs up to if your customers have new requirements they can add them to the for the next but you keep them out of the current when it comes to the next version you take on all the new ideas and spend time creating a new matrix only after the previous version has do the gurus say about are some these are just personal i read anything specificaly on cmm so point you there by is worth reading i think you mentioned but worth repeating i but i think software might be most relevant to it is a collection of some of which are online at the above 13 case for better software seems to be the kind of thing you are and are 2 of the they really touch on the specific issues you mention and are too early for but if you read them i would try to make time as they provide great also seem to recal published a lot on software quality this day the space shuttle is regarded as an example of probably they highest final have you read any of the or

 those things are still i do a fair bit of that kind of optimization to be mostly writing code that has to do relatively complex things in about 10ms on an if writing code running on more modern cpus then the benefits be as you care about and doing a fair bit of then you might also look at using whatever vector operations are available on your target platform sse on altivec on compilers easily use these instructions without a lot of and the intrinsics are pretty easy to use these another thing not mentioned in the document you linked to is pointer you can sometimes get good speed improvements if your compiler has support for some kind of of thinking about cache usage can be reorganizing your code and data in a way that makes good use of the cache can result in dramatic speed increases compared to optimizing away the odd copy or unrolling a the most important thing is to only optimize code actually make sure your optimization actually makes it and look at the disassembly to see what optimizations the compiler is already doing for you before you try to improve

 till a while a ago my code base was very close to every time i changed an even mildly important file practically all the files got main reason for such high header dependency was that i have many small functions that need to be inline and i was under the impression that for inline to work they need to be in the same translation unit as the calling so they need to be in the for the inline function to even compile other headers need to be included in the header as ad code visual one of the main stated advantages of this is that now inline function can cross translation still how can i really be sure that these functions really get i realize that the compiler can basically do whatever the hell it wants no matter where i define the there a way to check what gets inline functions and link time code

 to the choice is obviously tfs integration into visual studio is incomplete to say the least lot of features available from the and a bit buggy certainly while tfs one is perfect makes had my whole workspace corrupted several times using svn one never using tfs 2 related features of both systems are probably quite they are accessible directly from the ide with while you have to rely on or other external tools if you use all tfs tasks are accessible in a few clicks on the solution explorer is a lot easier with even for complex merges will add and to your so need to manually edit them to open them again from i think those reasons are more than enough to prefer tfs over i mus add that is more than just a tool work project used it on a project 3 3 business in the and been able to successfully centralize all the tasks in tfs project build not saying not possible to do the same using svn and other but definitely nice to have all things nicely integrated in one stay here are the two obvious drawbacks of tfs tfs is quite a while svn installation is a matter of tfs 2008 over sqlserver 2008 is quite you cannot install tfs on a to definetely the worst installation experience ever had with a microsoft being once tfs is very easy to use for coders not familiar with source control my current i started with and quickly switched to happy i main reason why decided to switch is clearly the overall buggy behaviour of svn was using as a server and as a at least once a i found myself spending hours on cryptical ankhsvn error i found a single reason to regret the switch to

 too am a big fan of spring when used in conjunction with spring which is just now webflow can be used with other web frameworks but most natural fit is with spring my case i went from struts to spring we had a lot of built up infrastructure for using one thing i underestimated when writing new pages in spring mvc is how much time we would spend essentially reinventing that talking common logic and so i know a whole lot about it sounds like having that problem you would with any web the fact that that process is still going on may be a real you ignore the fact that have it with something else find spring mvc and webflow are best once you have some infrastructure around validations and forms for we had this process a lot on our places validates parameters and either rejects order to or accepts verified order is returned to displayed to the user who confirms that they either want to place the order or cancel they cancel display a page saying it has been they approve verify the order it fails validation return to place the order and display the result to the may sound convoluted but it came up a where spring mvc really shines is for this kind of scenario you can create a custom controller and then the actual implementation just becomes an issue of plugging in the right views and support underestimate the cost of developing and testing required other thing to consider is team if noone else has spring mvc experience then going to present some be very careful taht you change just because make you personally more

 understand why git does not offer some kind of what you are referring to as an involving a you must first understand one of the of those scms clearcase for uses a version each version of an element or is linked in a direct relationship with the the previous version of the same uses a acyclic each of a file is actually part of a global set of changes in a tree that is itself part of a the previous version of that must be found in a previous accessible through a single directed acyclic graph a linear a config spec can specify several rules for achieving the you see a given first select a certain and if not then select another and if not then select a and so branch is a in a history a given version for a given select rule the other select rules before that one still hence the a a commit represents all the you will ever there is no selection of there is only one path in this graph to select all the files you will see at this exact point branch is just a new path in this in some other you must into your branch some other commit in the git mentioned by or your branch since git is a it will always result in a new you are with git is some kind of you are selecting different versions with different successive select but that would not be practical in a in when you are making a branch with you need to do so with a starting point a clearly defined and easily replicated to other a purely central you can define your workspace your either snapshot or with whatever rules you adds in the comment in his question once we see the two models can achieve different things vs my question which are the real life scenarios for companies more than where linear can do things not possible for are they worth it comes to in term of selection what you can do in a linear model is to have selection rules the same set of this for selection rules with alabel3 alabel2 selects all the files labelled branch from except for those labelled and branch from there that rule precedes the one mentioning it worth the ucm flavor of clearcase configuration methodology included with the clearcase and representing all the deduced from base clearcase does not allow for reasons of a set of files is called a and if you want to branch for a given label as a that would be translated like this following config alabel3 have to pick starting point and go from you want also the files from you will make a merge from all the files to the ones in is a you do not have to make with a where each node of the graph represents a uniquely defined for a whatever is the set of files and rebase are enough to combine that starting point with other versions of a given set of in order to achieve the desired while keeping that particular history in a general goal is to reason in version control operations applied to a set of files is one in a coherent its files are its files will branch from the starting is easily done in a dag it can be more difficult in a linear system with where the can be but it is enforced with the ucm methodology of that same of achieving that through a selection rule some select rule you achieve it only with vcs operations or which leave a clear trace for everyone to follow opposed to a config spec private to a or shared amongst some but not all it enforces a senses of opposed to a that you may have a hard time to reproduce later allows you to leave the realm of control and enter the realm of configuration which is mainly concerned with and that can be achieved with a or a

 union contains a set of your particular you can store the float char or int in the memory will only be allocated for the in the all items in the union will share the same of in other writing one value into the union followed by another will cause the first value to be need to go back and ask yourself you are you truly want the values of and to be mutually exclusive only one value can exist at if consider using a union in conjunction with an enum value outside the indicating which member in the union is the one at any particular point in this will allow you to get the memory benefits of using a at the cost of more dangerous code anyone maintaining it will need to be aware that the values are mutually exclusive it is indeed a consider this option if you are creating many of these unions and memory conservation is vital on embedded you may not even end up saving memory because you will need to create enum variables on the stack which will take up memory you want these values to be simultaneously active and not interfere with each if you will need to use a struct instead you put in your first this will use more memory when you instantiate a the memory that is allocated is the sum of all members some padding to the nearest word memory conservation is of paramount importance previous i would favour this example of how to use enums in conjunction with a float char int floatcharintunion unionselection selection selection selection unionselection switch case process case process case process

 using generics to create a key for a say this is definitely not a good idea for a couple different first reason is that it violates the reasoning behind a dictionary a key should hold some significance to the value it why are you storing a string under what does does it mean the string is either true or confusion like this makes the code harder to also suspicious that the key value is used in casting the string somewhere else in this is clearly a of dictionaries and second reason is that the session is shared within a so two completely different segments of code written by two different developers are accessing this shared what is to stop one developer from identifying as an appropriate for data a in their and another using as a for data b in their now the first developer is expecting a when accessing this but gets a unique key would prevent this from

 was a really good discussion on this over at last it answers your question pretty are pretty straightforward just remember the and xxx import are executable they when the running program reaches that a module is not in then an import creates the new entry in and then executes the code in the it does return control to the calling module until the execution has a module does exist in then an import simply returns module whether or not it has completed that is the reason cyclic imports may return modules which appear to be partly the executing script runs in a module named the script under its own name will create a new module unrelated that lot together and you get any surprises when

 was made to make writing a compiler it does a lot of stuff based on that one pointers only exist to make writing a compiler as do header many of the things carried over to are based on compatibility with these features implemented to make compiler writing a good idea when c was c and unix were kind of a c ported unix ran in this c and unix could quickly spread from platform to platform whereas an os based on assembly had to be completely to be concept of specifying an interface in one file and the implementation in another a bad idea at but not what c header files they are simply a way to limit the number of passes a compiler has to make through your source code and allow some limited abstraction of the contract between files so they can header really offer any advantage over another by putting more effort into the you can compile a reference object as easily as a pointer to the exact same object this is what does is a simple it had a very limited feature and you could write a compiler without much porting it is generally not trying to say a bad language or just that primary goals when it was created may leave remnants in the language that are more or less unnecessary but are going to be kept around for seems like some people really believe that c was written to port so first version of unix was in assembler but intention was that it would be in a first tried in 1971 to fortran on the but gave after the first then he wrote very simple language he called which he got going on the but there were because the implementation it was always going to the basic notions of which was based on the just were not right for machine like the used the to add to which for a while was called for and then he started write a compiler for that first phase of c was really these phases in short succession some language changes from adding the type structure without much change in the and the ritchie second phase was he of rewriting unix in started in the summer of 1972 but two figuring out how to the basic that how switch control from one process and the difficulty in the proper data since original version of c did not combination of the things ken to give up over the ritchie the i structures and probably made compiler code somewhat better better code and so over the that was when we made concerted effort and actually did the whole operating system in is a perfect example of what i from the only exist to make writing a compiler pointers exist because the simplest possible abstraction over the idea of adam rosenfield hour are in order to implement pointers are the simplest possible abstraction to in no way are they the simplest possible to comprehend or arrays are much to implement arrays as efficiently as pointers you have to pretty much add a huge pile of code to your is no reason they have designed c without but with code like will take a lot of effort the compilers to factor out the explicit and additions and make it create the same code that this would out that variable after the fact is new compilers can do but back then it just and the os running on that crappy hardware needed little optimizations like few systems need that kind of optimization work on one of the slowest platforms and most of our stuff is in and in the rare case where you might need the new c compilers should be smart enough to make that kind of conversion on its

 was wondering if any of you had successfully implemented ddd in a app and would like to share some are currently working on a smart client in flex and a backend in on the server we have a service layer exposed to the client that offers crud operations amongst some other service i understand that in ddd these services should be repositories and services should be used to handle use cases that do not fit inside a right we mimic these services on the client behind an interface and inject implementations via an ioc some questions the server expose repositories to the client or do we need to have some sort of a facade is able to handle security for the client implement repositories ddd in knowing that in the most of the logic is view related and real business logic lives on the all communication with the server happens asynchronously and we have a single threaded programming model on the about mapping client to server objects and vice we tried but reverted back to exposing the state of our objects and mapping directly to i know this is considered bad but it saves us an incredible amount of general i think a new generation of applications is coming with the growth of javafx and curious how ddd fits into and

 way described no reason that you need simply synchronize access to your data to ensure that it is in a consistent state when by i do not mean synchronize the entire data structure would end up blocking either producer or synchronize only those bits that are being and only at the time that you update find that most of the work can take place in an unsynchronized for if building a you can identify the node where the insert needs to synchronize on that do the then continue

 web authors validate their in which very little to choose between the doctypes and no good reason to change from the ide the only practical difference to browsers between strict and transitional is that strict triggers standards mode and transitional triggers almost standards mode in pages that actually require standards mode behaviour are very few and far between and certainly affect the overall proportions that you see on the worth noting that html 5 is being written without a largely because the authors of that recognise that the transitional doctypes of xhtml and html4 are widely

 well as the issues about being inferior to handling as a string is in itself a very unreliable way of might work better if every browser stuck to the scheme of identifying but they most browsers claim to be regardless of what they and that bit at the start is the only readily parsable part of the the rest is completely so scripts started searching the whole string for characterists substrings like this is a browsers deliberately spoof each including substrings like and in their user agent strings when not those mostly to defeat string browsers allow the entire user agent string to be spoofed under user browser variants for example ie mobile is nothing at all like regular but will still match browsers allow to write extra tokens to the user agent string including arbitrary just one registry change by a rogue can make msie look like matching is just inherently for example a new browser called would match

 went with team system and have been very probably got more stuff in it than i will ever but my thinking was do i want to spend my time on configuring and maintaining a lot of free software and roll my own development environment or spend my money on an integrated environment that our server guys could maintain for i decided that my time was worth a whole lot more to the organization writing code and was enough of a justification to make the investment in it much of a sell to my manager who fully agreed with since the server guys already maintain sharepoint and sql server for other not even much more effort for them just another server to worry about out of the dozens already since running it on a the hardware costs are i were working for my calculation may have been i would that you need to consider the expense not only of the software but also in terms of the amount of time willing to devote to maintaining your you need to consider the opportunity cost associated with pulling bits and pieces of your dev environment together and maintaining it when you could be writing paying

 what does a singleton provides global access to an instance of an guarantees that no more than one instance of that type can be you use a singleton when you need of these that is are generally we tend to avoid them when building your application around the assumption that more than one instance it is an is because you typically find out the assumption perhaps you want to be able to create multiple instances for caching perhaps it turns out you need more than one more than one or perhaps threading performance requires you to give each thread its own any you need to enforce the one instance may if you only need one simply create only one but leave the constructor publicly visible so that more instances can be created it turns out to be other both of the features offered by a singleton are actually in we our data to be globally and we to take away flexibility for no you do need one of the features offered by a implement that one without the if you need something to be globally make it a not a and if you do need to enforce that only one instance will exist think of any plausible situations where want perhaps an object representing a physical hardware then implement without the global only real world application of singletons ever seen has been architect has read the gof and decided to cram design patterns in or programmer stuck in the comfortable with the whole and wants to code which means storing data as and singletons sounds like an way to make globals without getting yelled key point is that a singleton mixes very and each very rarely you want one of those in any given

 what doing is really high volume then what looking for is something like it is a distributed work queue you just put a job on the queue and then forget about course then you need something at the other end reading the queue and processing the there are multiple ways of doing easiest is probably to have a cron job that runs sufficiently often to read the work queue and process the alternatively you can use some kind of persistent daemon process that is woken up by work becoming advantage of this kind of approach is you can tailor the number of workers to how much work needs to get done and beanstalkd handles distributed prorcessing the sense that the listners can be on different

 what i understand of just reading the bugzilla the bug manifests when two distinct problems hash algorithm generates collisions for urls that are from the bug seems to mean every 4 characters perhaps the urls are the logic for dealing with hash collisions fails because they flushed the previous url with the same hash value to disk if you have a page with two very similar urls this might happen on some versions of it generally happen on different i would since then ff will have time to flush the entries to disk avoiding the timing if you have multiple resources that are all loaded from the same make sure they have a run of 9 characters that are completely one way you might ensure this is by appending a querystring you with a random bit of something	
 what i understand you need a file system and not a memory allocation at in embedded systems dynamic memory allocation in a disk is a contradictory a either a hard disk or a flash used for persistent storage is much different than it is not only the way you access but the fact that disk storage when writing to a disk you need to have an algorithm for avoiding bad have you thought of this or can you consider your disk fault file system will deal both with space allocation and bad sectors is usually used in embedded although fragmentation performance is rather this prevented it from being used in many embedded most flash based devices actually use i suggest to start with what you have your operation system you use and the driver for your investigate if a suitable solution is already supported from also keep in mind that embedded devices are more difficult to debug if you set to implement your own algorithms expect longer development

 why do i get uzbekistan for the not selecting the item that grouping if you by get the expected however grouping by a different column so mysql know that is taking part in a and selects any old value from that in the join of it is possible you will see other countries than is part of a wider problem with mysql being permissive on what you can select in a group by for you can gender from registrations group by mysql will happily pick one of the gender values for a registration from each even though there is no direct causal link between country and other dbmss will refuse the above command on the grounds that there guaranteed to be one gender per as as registrations r join country c on by because a functional dependency between and you have correctly described your as a primary with rollup extension is a bit of a hack in the way it on the rollup row stage at the it runs over the entire result set to grab its and sets the column to also null other columns that have a functional dependency on that it probably but mysql currently really understand the whole thing about functional if you select it will show you whichever country name value it randomly and if you select it will show you whichever country id it randomly though is the join so must be the same as which is you can do to work around the problem by should be ok if are as well as and check that for being with rollup and do a separate query for the end this will be a little slower but it will also be ansi compliant so your app could work on other mysql has an option that is supposed to address this but it goes much too far and only lets you select columns from the group not columns that have a functional dependency on the group so it will make valid queries fail as making it generally

 working on a project and i would like to have a printer friendly version of the views i is there anybody who already did this and have some tips how to accomplish kind routing is was thinking of making a in the actionresult of a method in the printcontroller to return a view with a specific actionresult return walter advice to use this kind of redirecting because it is not the way mvc was meant to the view there will be a link to print the normal print want to use javascript or just show the same view the user is only with a different masterpage will have specific print for the quick but i it is not exactly the way i want i already have specific css files for a look at the following dutch website for example and want to have a link which displays the same view but with another in the other masterpage i include the css files for the user gets a view which is almost the same as from the browsers advantage of doing it this way it will comply to the wcag create a printer friendly	
 working on a project and one of the requirements is document uploading and i have decided on storing the documents on the web server and not in the the question i have is is a good approach to storing a large number of documents on the the uploaded documents will be associated with a master record id in the database so i thought about creating a folder with the same date the record as the master and then prefacing the file name with the id like this seem solid and i added the id to the file incase it ever gets moved out of the folder for any particular would there be any disadvantage to storing them this looking for feedback and maybe a better documents on webserver best	
 working on a project for school right now and trying to get it set up so that it is easily the webapp portion of it is written entirely in adobe we need links to certain files within the code which are different on different my server might use 8180 as the port while someone else uses one person is using windows so a filepath would be while mine would be there any way we could put these files into a separate config file and read them dynamically within the mxml would be really nice if we have to recompile for each individual in do i read from a config file in	
 working on a project where we will be connecting to a oracle webservice using the only thing is that we will build our client from our office but our customer will not give us remote access to their web service so our solution was to visit our customer and their webservice so that we can use the surrogate webservice to develop our client would be the best way to clone this clone will need to output sample but use their exact method calls and our preferred language to do the clone in is is the easiest way to clone a	
 working on a project which will do some complicated analyzing on some there will be 3 parts of the input supplied by such as such as if keyword 1 is repeated 3 times in keyword do and the analyzing itself which executes the rules and processes the user and generates the output necessary based on the this will lead to a lot of spaghetti code and many if statements in the processing i want to avoid and keep the rules the if separately from the code which loops through the user input and generates the can i do what is the best algorithm how to store rules separate from processing

 working on a windows app that periodically has to launch operations which may take some gotten into a pattern of having these operations run on a and writing up a quick winform for each where you pass in to the form the necessary the form wires up the backgroundworker and makes the function and the form displays the output bar text fills up with this form is very the only part that really differs between form copies is which method is called on which so what love to do is make it whereby we can take the pass in an object null for static a function and an array of and have it just from been able to do this with the thing we like about reflection in this case is the lack of things like the method call are caught at and not compile is there anything available now that might make this more elegant and heard of people talking about things like delegates and expression but not sure the former applies and still a little in the dark about the the background

 working on near the exact same partitioning is definitely the way to go i would segment by more than year it would give you a greater degree of just set up your partitions and then constrain them by months some other in your need to turn to really get the the additional benefit here is that you can only index the exact tables you really want to pull information if batch importing large amounts of data into this you may get slightly better results a rule vs a trigger and for i find rules easier to but for smaller triggers are much the postgresql manual has a great section on partitioning via

 works because you are following over you state that a customer model has many orders then rails expects there to be a field on the orders you have followed these conventions then rails will use them and will be able to build the necessary sql to find all the orders for a given you look at the file when you are developing your application you will be able to see the necessary sql being built to select all orders for a given does not create tables without you asking it the creation of tables is achieved by generating a migration which will tables for the fact that you create a customer model and then state within it that it will not create you an orders you will need to do that for yourself within a migration to create an orders within that migration you will need to either add a column or use the customer statement to get the field added to the orders

 works quite well when you do your things in powershell for example when you want to mess around with apps and windows it works great for scripting as the syntax is a lot nicer than in when you want to work with some typical unix then you can easily get into trouble when powershell converts all your lf line endings to crlf even think about piping binary my

 would a new object know which network to join or depending on what exactly you there are number of can use less precise timer than every for example something like time channel time the objects rezzed at nearly the same time are likely to have same channel according to the above although probably want to make sure that time 1000 is not near 0 or 1000 and perhaps use time 10000 in that than you can create some sort of discovery for rezzed object says hello on control server for each network in area responds with channel number of its chooses network he wants to nobody object becomes server for its own by incrementing control channel by some number example object wants to create its own network it increments highest channel in use by and creates its own you can combine both methods use to derive say and if server responds become otherwise become you can check appropriate higher and lower channel to avoid having two networks because of time rollover differences in rezzing of	
 would actually look very closely at something like adobe it is cross platform and can be based so chances are you have a heck of a lot to learn except maybe a javascript library or it has the ability to talk to a local datastore or over the interweb to a webservice or restful development is free with check out some of the stuff written in	
 would add a function that returns you a ref like rlbond for a quick fix or if you have control over the source of i would go with more actually because the following holds if is a pointer to a defined long discussion on about that same problem with good	
 would add pion web server to the list of potential web servers to on top of been using it to implement a rest interface and so far i have been very pleased the documentation is a bit bits i have had to program so far have been the transformations from to internal data there are a few downsides to having the web server integrated directly leaks in the system will affect the web libraries in are less than safety in is extra important because of memory	
 would advise against implementing your drawing objects as vcl you will not gain much from but some things would be much more difficult than when coding this on your controls are so for parallel diagonal lines one control would be on top of the at least generally mouse events reach only the topmost control in the something you would have to correct in your own lines should have the end points so the user knows where to grab them for moving or something a custom control does not provide so have to code would probably simply create a line object and implement all functionality for moving and deleting lines	
 would advise you to consider it fits with ddd very the idea is that your repository interfaces sit in a layer just outside domain and reference entities does not need to know about repositories at layer is not referenced by or anybody else and contains concrete implementations of repositories among other the common library with various helpers is called application core in this and it can be referenced by	
 would also just say i think correct in doing	
 would also look into either realbasic or they both create cross platform native personally i think realbasic would be a better choice as it is very language to you can learn some valuable skills with rb and it can grow with your i have been using vb and rb for more then 10 years combined and i think you will be	
 would also recommend since adobe is invested in making sure their flash player works browsers on you be dependent upon the moonlight development community to allow supportability linux and believe moonlight is also a version behind so you could also end up having to support multiple versions to capture the linux	
 would also say that double validation never hurt and can only increase also like to bring up a point about your business i assume this is a winforms but the principle applies to the web as the ui should not be enforcing business fine to put validation but it also needs to be in the business	
 would also think about not storing passwords in your one way hashes with md5 or sha1 are a way of adding a layer of security at the db or for further	
 would always take a look at john m about maybe browse through out	
 would appreciate it if you had some pseudocode on this but just following it over i interfaces for the data access objects that directly access the this way you can pass in an object that only pretends that it accesses the this object would then return results consistent with the results your database would without actually doing any db your object could also simulate scenarios such as rolling back data to its original each into a single method that is the essence of a if your method is 500 lines long then there must be contiguous blocks in there that can be write a unit test for if your unit test is testing too that probably means your method is doing too you can extract methods by identifying the different things you are testing and then putting them in their own rinse and repeat until you only need one test for each on to other sounds like a code a transaction in and by itself should only be one contiguous if you need different users to finish your doing too keep track of your state on the db in terms of flags or not in terms of a db	
 would assume that redmon streams to stdin in which case have to read from the input stream either via it is or raw binary stream a trivial example of something that reads from stdin reads text reversing void void string while chars you need to treat binary data slightly but conceptually it is

 would be a hack and probably not guaranteed to but a thought recommend you have your layout like you described like notifies the owner that an object is owned knows its it could calculate address like this is executed in the the assumption is that is at some fixed offset within the owned therefore the address of owned is equal to address minus that same this is undefined behavior which i but could possibly	
 would be best if you ask your provider these every provider is going to be what happens is that the provider can handle the but simply shut down your site once it reaches a certain	
 would be difficult to your system to draw constant this is better done with dedicated hardware that can respond immediately to current changes and actually implement the feedback loop you have problems you want to do it with then you probably must implement some form of a your problem is analogous to a fan used to control you have one input variable proportional to and one output variable level passed to	
 would be glad to get references to resources and experience on comparison of known jsf myfaces and icefaces in terms of ease to community as it was pointed out the initial question is not accurate there are few jsf implementations sun reference and some jsf component libraries but anyhow my question is about both core jsf and jsf component libraries jsf

 would be more ideal than the extra overhead of having two the microsoft url rewrite module for iis

 would be the ideal location to check in third party reference for a project in a version control typically i have seen most people to put them under so that the runtime can automatically pickup these however is that the right way to originally wanted to have a separate directory which is parallel to bin called lib which will contain all third party but this needs changes to the applications config file so that the lib directory is picked up by the run my idea over here is that lib will contain third party while bin will contain the projects binary be dll or is the preferred the concentration over is the location in the version control and not just the physical file of third party in version control for	
 would be very careful at introducing a code generator in a team like particularly the ones you that this can vary with the the current dal enough for the real requirements of the this is particularly important if you have a real need to introduce paging and other similar if the team have these in place and is already facing odds are they will have a hard time moving i would say this is more a case for an specially something part of the team have any previous knowledge on one of these have those members used them on a successful this is more important than it might specially if you are considering something as broad as which introduces its own consider something easy to and that takes you to an all out you have a clear understanding on how the tool and the way it is going to be used affect the developers time to introduce whichever the avoid having it put a on the as it gets in the middle of knowing what have changed when looking at the source control whichever the tool you the developers should be able to work with it with no if not it will get in the middle on an ongoing will you integrate the generated with the already non generated if this is not you might be talking about a full throw if you are in that introducing a new tool is not likely to solve the team have no test automation in doing changes with no test automation is a lot specially because it is hard not to break we introduced nettiers in a couple of projects sometime ago nice to us we did so at the beginning of the and even then it really got in the granted we had more code but that really mean we had more code that new features started being developed with custom code productivity and quality went up we have never used it again and never missed we use orms and other more focused code gen here and	
 would be wary of letting the os determine file status for you this is if got a shared resource i would restrict access to it using a this lock means one thread can get the resource and write to the next thread can check for this lock being held by another block indefinitely until the first thread releases would restrict two processes writing to the same i believe unix would do the	
 would be working on extracting the specific business logic code in the mfc app and sticking that stuff in a rather than trying to wrap up the whole might be making a false assumption here that it will take you less effort to wrap the mfc app up as a dll removing all the gui adding a dll main and modifying the build process to produce a than the effort to isolate the business logic code and put that in a new dll wrap the gui up as a dll you will need a pretty good understanding of the dependencies of the business logic code and how it is used by the so you may as well just cut that stuff	
 would caution that guids are random they should not be used as the basis to generate anything that you expect to be totally random of the winapi guid generator shows since the sequence of v4 guids is given the initial state one can predict up to next 250 000 guids returned by the function this is why guids should not be used in as random just use the random something like this found string stringbuilder builder new random random new char ch ch return are fine if you want something a unique filename or key in a but they are not good for something you want to be a password or encryption so it depends on your microsoft says that random is not that great either generate a cryptographically secure random number suitable for creating a random for use a class derived from such as	
 would check the code for the error pretty clearly indicates that an instance of nsmutabledata is being used where an nsstring is it would seem that either encodebase64 is somehow returning or else the raw is getting passed to not just break it down and check at each using nslog for this but stepping with a debugger would work fine of nsdata nsstring 64 is a encodes it to best guess is that accidentally passing in the raw nsdata instead of an nsstring but failing the above code should either work correctly or show exactly where things are breaking	
 would create one source control branch for the common code representing the latest and greatest for each project have your own independent branch of that code where you can make quick fixes where needed or have stability when close to a may want to have a wiki where bugs found in the common code are listed so the other users of the shared code are aware of it and get time to fix it at their would work well for this since it is good at merging changes back to the	
 would create the whole on the server and inject it into the that approach bypasses annoying browser and reduces the complexity of the did mention that you tried but it failed in i would suggest persevering in getting it to posting another question asking for help on that or editing your question to show us what you made that work in

 would definitely return a 500 error with a json object describing the error similar to an ajax error i believe this is fairly definitely nice to have that consistency when handling potentially unexpected error why not just use the built in functionality in if writing it in wcf and asmx services make it easy to serialize data as without reinventing the	
 would definitely stick with the immutable version if you really need the class at immutability makes it easier to reason about your code if you store a reference to a useful to know that not going to the performance is almost certain to be insignificant the io involved in reading the line is likely to be more significant than creating a new if concerned about should should the code before you decide to make a design decision based on those performance if your state is just a are you really providing much benefit over just storing the strings directly and having appropriate methods to analyse them does analyse the string and cache that or is it really just a bunch of parsing	
 would definitely turn anything i can into static for a different when are called without a for that a 3 parameter function pushed with 4 params on the same function compiled as a static function would get called with 3 can free up registers for the jit and conserve stack	
 would depend on a lot of for most copying the url to a new window or tab will start a new where a refresh would maintain the current	
 would ditch the function in favour of a for loop since it is i would also add some waits using the but only every so often and only if you want to wait for 5ms each time because then processing 3500 records would take approx is an example using a for loop that processes 100 records can tweak at 5 ms intervals which gives a 175 ms xmlelements length index process for index var toprocess perform xml if 1 length index 100 would also benchmark the different parts of the xml processing to see if there is a bottleneck somewhere that may be you can benchmark in firefox using profiler and by writing out to the console like start t new some xml to new t this	
 would do it like abstract class parent protected final string protected string only if this makes throw new cannot be birthmark class child extends parent public string means that the variable can be initialized once per the compiler able to make sure that every subclass will provide the assignment to birthmark so it forces the assignment to happen in the constructor of the parent added the checking for null just to sho wthat you also get the benefit of being able to check the arguments in one place rather than each	
 would do something is or or like and is or or you make your empty search strings nulls before passing you can skip the

 would find a more recent to at least suplement your have anonymous partial and many other features that have changed the way i write	
 would first like to are you creating your own template there are some mature ones around like which should be able to fill your this article by jeff atwood is also good read reinvent the unless you plan on learning more about you want to roll your own solution then that is here are some method relies on having the bbcode extension installed with it is native and does not rely on the regular expression engine this solution will be the can have the bbcode parser convert print as print into the bbcode arguments to learn about passing variables into your can view some more examples on the method are a little bit but are enabled by default on all php to go gumbo for this regular expression should can then use it as successful you can access the content using else match attempt	
 would give an entry point to the most common case and call this function in the general no mod computation is done where i is already in it assumes or if return is if return return in no return

 would go studio xps 16 year because you want a bigger screen as a nicer design for the studio xps is always a i like black	
 would go with the but it depends on what you know about the you are expecting that the variable will exist most of the then a is less if you are expecting the variable to be none most of the then an if statement will be less	
 would go with the second more and both equally easy to understand you probably have no way of knowing how many times those statements in the while loop are going to be so who it could be a performance or a performance gain but	
 would go with the surrogate but you may want to have a computed column that the surrogate key into a more value if that improves your the computed colum could produce example 2 from the surrogate key for instance for display think the surrogate key route is the way to go and the only exceptions that i make for it are join where the primary key could be composed of the foreign key even in these cases finding that having a surrogate primary key is more useful than	
 would go with the text file option rather than in the you do as your project you can update other tools that you may or may not start to use on your project phpunderconstrol or a deployment to be able to this number without having to risk those files touching real code and potentially causing this all depends on how you see your project progressing and whether you think you will ever use any other	
 would have to disagree with those are in favor of in a design test we did for a fairly website 1mil uniques at the we found that tabs have not been tabs were clearly located to the right of the main content based on that experience i would suggest either finding an alternative as staticscan suggested run usability tests to figure out which ones

 would keep the cobol core but expand around the provide a tool called enterprise server which allows cobol to interact with web you have a cobol program a and another cobol program b and a calls b via the interface the tool allows you to expose interface section as a web program you then generate a client proxy and a can now call b via a web because b now has a web service any other type of program windows asp can now also call they have a product called which runs inside visual studio and translates cobol to this means that you can then link in any the approach is to keep the cobol core but interface via web services and do new developments in any clr compliant language vb	
 would like a page that displays a list of nodes can do this part with the views and then also displays the details of a single node below the ideally the details will update via ajax when a node in the list is but reloading the page would be fine for a just starting to get into drupal and the number of levels at which i can do stuff is somewhat for example should this be a view page with a customised block at the a page with two blocks for the list one for the if so how would they communicate the node is there already a module that will do this for maybe i should write my own and so if anyone with a better general understanding of drupal could point me in the right direction it would be for the answers so i think they point out that i missed out an important detail in my original question some more would like this page to effectively be a home as such my view is restricted to showing nodes that editing the default node page would give me the problem of which node to send the user to when they log in may be possible i and also would mean that i presumably view the node without also seeing the have been trying another tack which is to create page node which includes the view using some i have also set the view control to create a link for each node in the list and include the node id in that link 13 is the node id of the page i have created and 12 is the node id of the item in the the find the second print this but sure a more drupal way of doing things the query string parsing is a nasty to display a list of nodes and details of a single node in

 would probably help you to understand the php data types and how affected when you do operations to variables of various you say you have variable in php say but what type is that probably a since an integer have that value just so when you do operator a string and an i know how to add a string and an but i do know how to convert a string into an and then add two ints so let me do and then it converts to because the php rules for converting a string to an integer say that any number of leading zeroes in the string are which means that the string becomes the i know how to add 1 and and the output of that statement is	
 would probably introduce a method for the class and perhaps a extension method for various collections of the this method would simply go through and reference all the getters on the public properties of the class to ensure that they are you would invoke before sending the to your flex you might even want to make this an interface so that you can test for the need for finalization before transfering your objects and invoke the method based on a test for the interface rather than checking for each class finalize is just the first name that popped into there may be a better name for

 would start with using classes for some of the path manipulation you are the path class has a nice method that should replace your method call maybe even since that is what you seem to be trying to do main difference i see in regards to and is that the latter has the full path and the former this leads me to think that it is some sort of path others have could you post some more details such as you are	
 would store all the information i gather while offline in a sqlite on user you can sync all the stored information with a server using http or a custom protocol you can come up have been using this approach on palm os applications for almost 10 years and they do work very far as i the only you will have to accomplish this is plain old with cocoa although you could use some libraries that will make your life easier if you decide to implement your own santa	
 would store the it tends to make code clearer when not calling all the and though in your case you may not need to change ids or allow elements without pretty common to want to do apphacker i expect efficiency improvements from doing as getelementbyid tends to be fairly in there any performance issues i should know from javascript objects to dom objects are fine on their but when a dom object has a link back to such a javascript object through an event got a reference this causes to leak memory as it fails to free up the cycled for small simple apps you may not for you might have to work around the for example by indirecting every event handler through a lookup so there is no direct reference from the dom object to the real event	
 would strongly advise you to use vim within an ide and eclipse this is the combination i use and it works very used to be a vim however the refactoring and code analysis within a modern ide will far surpass any capabilities that vim will provide plugins get me i love vim and still use it for all sorts of modern ides are the most productive route

 would suggest running the process as a scheduled task if you and writing a service only if you need services are quite a bit more difficult to write and if running your process on a schedule of any much better off using the windows scheduler than attempting to build a scheduler of your own the windows task scheduler is more efficient than your scheduler will windows task scheduler offers a number of options that you almost certainly attempt to but may find useful later you build a have to recompile the program if you want to change the logic that determines what conditions to run the task if you use the you just flip some options and are done with trying to decide between the then obviously using the task scheduler is a viable and if using the task scheduler is a viable then building a service is almost certainly the wrong	
 would suggest that you not use from based at least not without some additional credentials way too easy to and certainly not difficult if you know email you echo the email back to the user for you can make things a little more but realize that your service can end up being used as a sort of spamming could send 100 upload requests to with a forged from and go ahead and spam the real person with 100 confirmation

 would suggest you try and make your mysql environment and you environment to both use a universal datetime format rather than a localised then you can use to use a reliable format at all from that you should be able to pass your dates to your database as date typed parameters rather than as a string and therefore it will handle the underlying conversion for i use sqlserver though not mysql so i know if you get the same

 would think that with a clustered index on the that access will still be screaming and you are really storing about the same amount of data as you would with the think that with a properties table you will end up storing much more than what you actually namely the extra index of the user the property key and the fact that the property value will need to be able to handle values of a generic nature making it difficult to advice is to try to put it all in one table and then fire it up with some test it work then you could go down the path of a multiple table solution or even a solution silver bullets after

 wrappers to and using them in a disciplined track the memory that you do allocate a linked list and use a wrapper to exit to enumerate your memory to free you also name the memory with an additional parameter and member of your linked list in applications where allocated memory is highly scope dependent you will find yourself leaking memory and this can be a good method to dump the memory and analyze in your application will make this very see other answers regarding threading

 writing a dsp application in a multitrack been profiling it for quite some time on different machines and noticed some my home the first run of the playback loop takes up about of the available assume due to the jit doing its then for the subsequent loops it goes down to a steady the problem if i run the application on a slower the first run takes up more than the available causing the playback to get interrupted and messing the output which is after it goes down to a after the first the application keeps calling some routines from time to time 2 seconds more or which causes the steady consumption to experience very short peaks of noticed that if i let the application run for a while these peaks will also go down to a not sure if due to the jit recompiling these portions of i have a serious problem with the while the application will behave nicely even in very slow these are going to be a big trying to figure out how to resolve this issue and come up with an which is to mark all the routines with an attribute that will tell the application to them beforehand during so be fully optimized when really but this is only an idea i like it too much and i wonder if a better solution to the whole like to hear what you guys the application is not an i like and want all the jit optimizations i can consumption and garbage collection kicks are not an using object pools and the maximum peak of memory during playback is 304 the jit compiler to generate the most optimized code during application

 writing a little python program that goes through an xml file and does some replacement of it takes three a path from whcih it creates a directory the xml file its reading and the xml file its outputting it works fine from the command line just passing in as its not just for i thought id put a qt front on below is the majority of the qt movtomxf is the class that does all the so you can see that im basically just grabbing strings and feeding them into the class that ive already made and def def path xmlfile outfilename print path xmlfile mov1 def file def file def file probelm is that when i feed in a it now comes back with an either the directory doesnt or if i have a trailing slash on the end that line in elif path or think its probably some mismatch between the the qstring its passing back and the string the my python but im not sure how to go about fixing running on max os x for any help you can passing directory to python	
 writing a module that can be accessed from either or the right to handle the is to have the client code you what environment this should be a minor imposition on client and greatly reduce the complexity of your one possible solution would be to have the client pass in an object that conforms to the same interface a quick glance at the msdn docs shows not an interface defined for so the easy route is	
 writing a program that implements scvt centroidal voronoi i start with a set of points distributed over the unit sphere have an option for random points or an there will be from a several hundred to maybe 64k then need to produce probably several million random sample for each sample find the nearest point in the and use that to calculate a for that weigh may have to be looked up from another spherical but that set will stay static for any given run of the i move the original points to the calculated and iterate the probably 10 or 20 this will give me the centers of the voronoi tiles for subsequent i will need to find a given nearest to see what tile the user clicked this is trivially solved within the above and need to be the part i need to be efficient is all those millions of nearest neighbors on the unit any using z but not set in it just looks like it will simplify also using c as most familiar with but not wedded to that choice considered using the spiral pattern for the sample as that gives me at least the last found neighbor as a good starting point for the next but if i do it looks like it would make any sort of tree search i thought i was clear with the title and i can generate random points the issue is the nearest neighbor an efficient algorithm when all the points are on the unit neighbor on a unit with roughly evenly distributed

 you are using flexbuilder the idea is that you will create a project that has a single thing to be built file repository you mentioned you is definitely a must have for build tools such as personal and in popularity and ability pretty to your toolbox allow you to do more advanced building even these types of tools will allow the building of a large application with many aspects and dependencies in a single this is a must for applications and development for larger projects with a lot of i will often have a single project that is little more than a build script that calls build scripts and puts everything maven is particularly good at there are eclipse that help out with both of those situations require different ways to use the projects it may be helpful to directly link to a library project as a that way your projects are able to debug the linked code and modify it as or if library projects are less commonly modified then their assets could be dropped into the folder of the dependant project eliminating the need to have the generating project open while development goes your projects to a situation goes a long way to keeping it generally i have a folder for each client and in there a folder for each if that project needs to be broken down into then all of those will be located in that project folder matter what the relationship is to each it is of course helpful to have a number of assets be created for a single this could be multiple for different different for distribution to different places or clients or a dozen other projects are sometimes a good example of sometimes i have a that is just my collection of i normally access this project from within flexbuilder and it normally have the and other eclipse

 you ask about an you can just easily get a pointer to its so it basically boils down to the question whether pointers can be used transparently with stl a pointer actually is the most powerful kind of an there are different only forward and and only only forward and and only only and forward and and access arbitrary steps forward and backward in one and each iterator in the second group supports all the things of all iterators mentioned before a pointer models the last kind of iterators a random access you may an arbitrary integer and you may read and and all except the output iterator has a that can be used to access a member of the element type we iterate iterators have several typedefs as what the iterator iterates over reference to the pointer to the what type the distance between two iterators has by this is a it is typedefed to a type that represents the kind of the either algorithms can use it to overload on different kinds of iterators is faster for random access because it can just return a pointer of course does not have those has an template and specializes it for so if you want to get the value type of any you whether it is a pointer or some other it will give you the of that a pointer can very well be used with stl as someone else even can be a a pointer is a very good example of an iterator because it is so exceedingly simple but at the same time so powerful that it can iterate over a

 you compare this to hoe java deals with events on a gui component exactly the but the same general you wind up with something void void void void of the things are you then provide one or more classes that implement the interfaces prefer one class per listener others prefer to make a ingle class that implements all of the proves to be very flexible because things can register only for the events that they are interested alternative is a single method where the listener interface has every single possible event in that would be a bad idea unless you are ok with things being notified about events that they do not care do you anticipate wanting fine grained control over what you can listen if so the java model works well ok if you care about it it is very if you think that everything will want to be notified of all events then the single way works sounds like you want fine grained so be fine with doing it the java event way of an interface for each general category of

 you have is that you have tags whose counts are from min to the threshold issue can be ignored here because it amounts to setting every count below threshold to the threshold value and taking the minimum and maximum only want to map the tag counts to but in a which basically means i understand the the tags with count max get weight your the tags with the count min get weight your it holds that when your count decreases by the weight is multiplied with a constant k which indicates the steepness of the we that with x the exponent is zero and the multiplicand on the right becomes we have the extra requirement that and we can which we taking logarithm on both ln k ln ln k ln right hand side is negative as because k ln now you have the formula to calculate after this you just apply for any count x between min and you are

 you have not found the code to be the slow part of the application via a profiler then you do anything about it it is but the code is and is and there are other slower areas that you can work on speeding up do those it is buggy then you need to fix it go for the hash table as it will be faster than the this assumes that the order that the data is traversed does not if you care about what the insertion order is then stick with the list can do things with a hash table and keep the but that will make the code much that you need to search the list only on occasion the odds of this being a significant bottleneck in your code is data structure to look at is a which basically lets you skip over a large portion of the this requires that the list be sorted depending on what you are may make the code slower

 you have to make changes to the api which already has some probably the best route is to deprecate the old api calls and encourage use of the new the capability of the old api calls would probably break the functionality of old so that is probably going to cause some developers using your api to become somewhat your language provides ways to indicate that certain functionality has been it can serve as a indication for the users to stop using old api calls and transition to new calls in the javadoc can provide notes in the documentation that a feature has been or from java 5 the can be used to raise warnings on calls to deprecated apis it would probably be a good idea to provide some tips and hints on migrating from the old api to the new api to encourage people to use the new way of interacting with the having examples and sample code on what to do and what not to the users of the api would be able to write code according to the preferred going to be difficult to change a public but with some care taken in the transition from the old to i believe that it the amount of pain inflicted on the users of the api can be mitigated to a certain an article on and when to deprecate from which might provide some more information on when it would be appropriate to deprecate parts of thank you to david schmitt who added that the in is similar to the annotation in the edit was overwritten by my as we were both editing this answer at the same

 you know how many object be adding very difficult to come up with an optimal all you can do is try to minimize the cost that you know is happening which in this case is that your vector is being constantly could do this in two split your operation into building and this is where you build the list into a vector that is guaranteed to be big enough and when done copy it to another enough for 1000 add when your vector is full call reserve with enough for another set of alloc space for 16 more could choose a different container that did not result in all elements being copied upon a but your bottleneck may then become the individual memory allocations for the new	
 you know that the div is going to have text in you can count the div can have html tags in going to have to traverse its children looking for text ret var length i i var node ret 1 return words count is the same logic that the jquery library uses to achieve the effect of its jquery is a pretty awesome library that in this case is not if you find yourself doing a lot of dom manipulation or ajax then you might want to check it noted by gumbo in the the way we are splitting the strings above would count two consecutive spaces as a if you expect that sort of thing even if you probably best to avoid it by splitting on a regular expression instead of on a simple space keeping that in instead of doing the above you should do something like count only difference being on what passing to the

 you link against you are in the so instead of developing an api for this command line just write a little wrapper that interacts with the program directly on the command you are not and now are just executing a binary your code will not have to be released under the may use exec and friends to do it is a simple solution and depending on how the application expects its input on the command line it can work very well based stuff is harder need a terminal of some the comments it sounds like even this is not and could still cause i suggest contacting a lawyer to make sure you are in the he will be able to interpret the gpl and tell you what you may and may not do with would think that just executing an program and then sending it data piping data into should not cause your program to also be gpl is too if i use a command line tool by executing it and piping data to it my program can still become that is just give me and or mit anytime of way simpler to

 you make a mistake when writing a url as a it be caught until this attempting to refer to a route that been created as an extension method will create errors at which you can quickly correct if you use visual if you discover a mistake in the way you formulated a you only have to fix it in one instead of cluttering your urlhelpers with extension it might be better to have a static class called something like commonurls that holds static readonly properties static if you i just realized that you would need to pass an instance of your urlhelper to the commonurls silly in that extension methods probably are the right tool for the	
 you make it a new making a different possible that to detect using reference which would obviously treat this as a new what point are you actually making changes to the i would linq to sql to have a cached copy of the original and then compare that with the new if taking that by just copying the then whatever you do to that it will always think the two are if instead you create a and then change then the old object will still have the old so the comparison will understand that made does that make

 you put projects b and c into the same solution as project a then no way to make sure you have binaries for b and c containing the latest source code when you build project easiest solution seen is to have a common folder in the source code repository where every project copies its binaries if they need to be then all other projects can reference binaries in that folder as long as your local folders look the same as the a perfect but pretty easy to work

 you sure you need you need to add new code when adding a new disease there is little point in making the to be data driven static will just complicate you are worried about a mismatch between the database and the you can verify that database and the constants match when starting up the you have the diseases defined in a table and are using some kind of referential integrity you do think you need a data driven you probably should not need any fields for at as the code really depend on in that case each disease should be a proper object with a identity and other you need special handling for certain types you probably should go back to an enum you instead have many diseases might be added and only a few types several diseases are handled in the same way by the same add a type in the and in the code as an enum for the and use that to run different each disease actually have a lot of it might be a good idea to try to write one class for each can then do a proper thing with and interface enum cludge is not neccesary since java as you can get both do a static import if you need when using validating the database is simpler as you get an enumeration for fields should probably be located in a class called disease or sickdude instead of a gigantic global constants for the fields in possibly as an inner public enum in the class where they

 you typically retrieve all the data for one entity id you should consider making the index just entity id and not unless you need the database to do unique effect is to make the index smaller so you get more of it in your goal should be to get the index to be in even if you need to do by date you will find that mysql can order 3650 values in a fraction of a second on the fly the this issue is the time to read the rows from your main performance issue is that the inserts result in data for one entity spread out across the disk requiring a disk access of each which will make your query run at a few hundred rows per your partitioning wont help this becaause each entity is in a single partition and the rows are spread across its on the disks will help a get efficient retrieval you need to get the data for a entity to be contiguous on which means reordering the data from the insert you can do this with mysql alter order by but it takes i have had a 182m row table doing a alter order by running for the last 2 weeks and it finished why i wrote a custom storage the not sure that you gain anything at all by partitioning unless you are partitioning across multiple servers or at least multiple the hard work that mysql has to do made any easier by all about disk access each partition on a different disk might i would not have more than twice as many partitions as you have physical 2 rather than 1 would give some queuing but i doubt that would have much i doubt you get much better than a single table using raid0 across as many disks as you performance of this application is determined by the number of disk and therefore helped if you can do more seeks per gain some processing parallelism you have multiple with partitioning but your system is going to be not processor if you get your processor utilization as high as you are probably doing something you need do something that your have been optimizing and operating this kind of application for the nine years using mysql and i have all the scars you might expect from the once your data is vastly larger than the size of your memory is my definition of the entire performance issue is which means primary the number of good	
 you ultimately i is to have the user type depending on the user will get slight different the first will not fulfill but the second on the price of code you can do is to invert the struct vectorbase struct struct struct vector implement the few functions that depend only on n being some specific value in the appropriate you may add a protected destructor into to prevent users deleting instances of through pointers to they should not even be able to name put those bases in some implementation like idea is to combine this solution with the one mentioned in another inherit privately of publicly as and add wrapper functions into the derived class that call the implementations of the another idea is to use just one class and then to enable or disable them for particular values of or use a transformer like this which is much anyi struct i2t anyi struct forward to the void case for n void case for n void general void it is completely transparent to the user of it also add any space overhead for compilers doing the empty base class optimization	
 you update the environment in the calling process this in a subprocess cannot modify the environment of the parent one notable exception is batch files on when run from a cmd based on the example you i guess you are not running on windows what trying to accomplish is done with a shell script that sets up the environment and then invokes your intended for you might write a script like executable and now you can run your app as you can make your script more elaborate if you like for you may want to make a parameter to the script rather than hard coding

 you want the module observed by accessing the file system itself opposed to individual is outside the scope of the c and since lua itself is the exception of the dynamic loader used to implement for c written in standard the core language lacks many file system it is easy to extend the lua core since any platform that has a file system also supports dlls or shared lua file system is a portable library that adds support for directory file attribute and the emulating some of the capability of dir in lua is essentially as simple or name in local fqn local attr produces output that looks directory directory file file your copy of lua came from for then you already have lfs and the above sample will work out of the the lua solution might also be a sensible c or the lua core is not at all provides a and is easy to interact with from c either as a hosting application or as an extension to use lfs from a c you would link with the lua initialize a lua and get the state to execute the either via or by using the c api to retrieve the function from the global push the string and call the lua function with something like which leaves the table on the top of the lua approach probably makes the most sense if you already had a need for an embedded scripting and lua meets your

 you want to do in a unit test is make sure that the method does the job that it is supposed to if the method uses dependencies to accomplish you would mock those dependencies out and make sure that your method calls the methods on the objects it depends on with the appropriate this way you test your code in of the benefits to this is that it will drive the design of your code in a better in order to use for you naturally gravitate towards more decoupled code using dependency this gives you the ability to easily substitute your mock objects for the actual objects that your class depends you also end up implementing which are more naturally both of these things are good design patterns and will improve your order to test your particular for you might have your class depend on a factory to create connections to the database and a builder to construct parameterized sql commands that are executed via the pass these mocked versions of these objects to your class and ensure that the correct methods to set up the connection and build the correct execute and tear down the connection were or you inject an already open connection and simply build the command and invoke the point is your class is built against an interface or set of interfaces and you use mocking to supply objects that implement those interfaces and can record invocations and supply correct return values to the methods that you expect to use from the

 you want to do this sort of as infrequently as because no particularly efficient way to do you specify what sort of data your site has on but going to assume something like a or a going to talk about this sort of functionality as it would be done for a but a similar approach would work for a you only want to be doing the when a page is changed submitted in the first note that there are two different ways that links have to be when a page is created or you need to search that text to determine what links should be in whenever any page is or you need to addition to the search of this page in the case of search all other pages to links as there are a few options for how to store these option is to keep two of every text in the one version is the original this is what you actually and what will be displayed if you choose to edit the the second version is the this is the data that is used to display the page to normal if your wiki markup for bold is the has and the has this makes it so that you have to process your markup on every page approach is applied to by doing a search through the submitted text to find words that should be and putting those links into the for when a page is you would step through every word in the text and compare it against a list of sure you have this list you want to be doing a database query for every this can be made fairly efficient by storing the potential linkwords as keys into a if the word being tested is in the you put a link to the relevant page around the word when you copy it into the if you just put the word exactly as it was in the are a few other options about how to implement but a fairly straightforward leave you with that for but if like to me to describe any of the other let me know in a comment and edit it

 you want to merge most but not all of the commits on branch to for you can do it requires some as mentioned the usual use case is to merge everything from a but sometimes it happens that you made a change to a release version that be integrated back that been superceded in master so how do you represent here suppose maint has had 5 changes and one of those is not to be merged back into although all the others should you do this in three actually merge everything before that tell git to mark as merged even when it and then merge the the magic git merge git merge ours git merge first command merges everything your troublesome maint commit onto the default merge log message will explain merging second command merges the troublesome but the option tells git to use a special in works by simply keeping the tree you are merging into and ignoring the you are merging but it does still make a new merge commit with head and as the so the revision graph now says that is so in fact you probably want to use the option to as to explain that that commit is actually being final command simply merges the rest of maint into master so that all synced up

 you want to take the and challenging i would suggest the you want to take something and challenge i would suggest taking the suggest skimming a short anecdote about my c programming experience that i wrote i learn the past 3 years i have been doing c only development as an electrical engineer and i have found the experience to be a c programmer you will find for performance and designing lots of low level building blocks that are taken for granted in higher level coding for doing some coding for performance and developing i will have to say that i am i find it really exciting and i find to be one of the most challenging and interesting implementing lots of low level building first i was very annoyed at having to implement my own low level but as time progressed i realized that it takes real skill to successfully implement something like a circular buffer that is fast and in the if i need to implement some fancy data structure with lots of dynamic memory usage and pointers i will easily be able low level implementation work also makes using any of the higher level work very very easy because once you have done low level work the high level stuff is memory almost forgot to mention this because in c you are forced to make decisions about memory every couple of and you even realize it after a basically this is probably one of the best parts of c because it forces you to think about how you are using memory always and as a result you become much much more proficient in using consider blocks to be more interesting and challenging than the higher level explain my opinion of higher level languages using my experience using higher level has been and because feel like a child who is given a box of legos to build something can build many things with legos and they can be very but you are to the tools in your lego resultant output sometimes a tendency to look similar to other lego process of building your lego output is not as challenging as building your own lego pieces and then building your project from your own obligatory warning about metaphors and how they are useful for getting a point across but not for completely explaining

 you would have one comprehensive domain model for the you can use the domain model in your service layer or the controller if it is a small for your you can use presentation objects to make the views easier to these are sometimes also called dto or view model basically what you do is create an object that contains all the data from the model that is necessary for the view to be model may class public string class public string want the view to output the name and model of the car and you would have to pass both the car and driver model objects the than sending the two model objects directly from the controller to the you can create an object which contains just the data you class public string public string would populate this object from the domain data and pass that to the and the view would you have to worry about lazy loading issues or complicated view logic to deal with model more work to create these view model objects but they really help keep the view clean and provides an easy way to do formatting before sending data to the are projects and conventions you can use to help automate the creation of the view if you want to look into is an

 you you may have 100 steps but each of those steps will take a different amount of time depending on what they approach would be to group tasks by what doing changing registry copying and for each assigning some key monitorable metrics apply unpacking an average rate for that you need to build a list of what going to be doing for the whole a 100meg file out 120megs registry values up from that you can work out an overall based on your preset average values but the key to accuracy is updating each metric multiplier as you learn how fast can do each took microsoft a decade to get it right so be too distressed if it work at first

 your business logic can vary depending on what method returns and thus it is ok to your method to return empty list then go with an exception if your business logic has no intend to have an empty if it is because of wrong passed go with assert or logic if it is because of external data problem like database connection or filesystem error then ggo with runtime go with it will be very hard to understand this behavior	
 your business objects are as clean as suggest maybe looking at an orm mapper such as hibernate or rather build your own data access suggest making these classes as as for instance in i would have a integer field which would represent the foreign instead of having a returning a object in the business methods such as would probably be better placed in a different class such as etc which contains your data access really matter from an efficiency point of view which approach you go but always good practice to have

 your looking for a project that templates a rest correct in saying there is no out of the box restful web services are possible using the key part is to use several attributes when defining your service functions that let the framework know that the function is not expecting the main attribute to use is the is an example from uritemplate post above code will actually be defined in an interface for your web the interface is created automatically when you create your wcf web service the actual code for the function will be placed in the class used to implement the web out the article on for a full it might seem overwhelming at first if your new to but after you dive into sure start to pick things up here is the link for the answer all of your in you should be able to build restful services using but if you have the option to use i would strongly recommend going the route of wcf since it is much easier and is designed with rest in converting your project be hard at just a matter of targetting the new version of the framework in your project converting a web service from a service to a wcf service will be a bit trickier the easiest way to do so would be to copy the code from each of the different web service functions into the class where you implement the new version of the shinanigans not sure what this starter kit is that referring restful web services should be fully supported in wcf which was fully released as of it would be helpful to understand wcf at least a little before but not crutial to understand it completely in order to get i would recommend just reading through the article on at least and then begin sure you will come across other questions as you but you can look up those parts as you come across i hope this information good luck to improvements have been made in the rest as darrel miller mentioned in the wcf was not in fact built with rest in i in fact the framework is built with soap in mind and the webinvoke attribute fills the although there is a lot of debate around the topic api vs wcf web api is a new option for building rest services in i would strongly recommend that anyone who reads this post and is able to use in their project look into it as an
