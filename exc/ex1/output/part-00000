 150k rows per the size of a these rows contain redundant data that you might be able to minimize by just keeping generall always a good thing to keep tables small so that index updates go through as mentioned by ben s above your queries should be optimized at least so that no access to columns with missing you can find some possible issues using explain and in the slow query log of your mysql server if got it thing that might help you with performance issues is the memcached using it you can delay writes to your thereby taking out some of the steam and still suffer from dirty caches and though depending on the application framework using any at it requires some work to implement this into your archiving and statistics purpose i suggest you take a look at infobright an open source mysql drop in replacement on designated purpose is to be a data warehouse you can use it for all sorts of data analysis got a very nice compression that in our case reduces of raw data to about compressed i guess needless to say that querying specific rows of compressed data be quite but for statistics pretty darn so if not querying specific rows but instead analyze things like many rows got updated with value foo bar between dec 08 and feb it will give you very good in as you use the db it will analyze your usage and create a knowledge grid that will optimize data for your specific next question that would come to my mind if data that keeping for a or some is a relational db the right tool for the knowing the exact nature of your application i could imagine some sort of sessions could reside in a terracotta cluster for that write a transaction log and commit their data every so often might be better but as i that depends heavily on your nature and the ammount of data in

 2 years of building highly optimized java code that to be optimized that i would say that there is a rule that governs on the of your development because you have to do it countless times single time you have to amend your just when you have had it of your development time do it only back to it and optimizing when too of your development because you have to plunge yourself back into the i would come to the conclusion that there is a right time and a right way to do it entity by entity by if you have classes that have a well defined job to and can be tested and test make sure the logic is optimize just and forget about that implementation details

 5 is almost completely backwards compatible with java the only change you make when you migrate is to rename any usages of the new keyword in the java 4 full list of potential compatibility problems is listed only other one that run into in practice is related to the change in the jaxp in our it simply meant removing from the far as refactoring i think that migrating your collection classes to use the new generic versions and removing unnecessary casting is a good but as another poster pointed changing to generic collections tends to work best if you work in vertical you end up having to add casting to the code to make the generic types compatible with the feature i like to use when migrating code is the it helps to catch inheritance problems when refactoring new concurrency library is very useful if your code uses for you may be able to replace thread pools with a would definitely take the approach of updating the code as you change it during normal other than the compatibility i think there is a compelling reason to use the new java 5 features unless already changing the code for other

 a codebase in which one particular text string occurs the string may be some kind of message for or an xml tag of these examples are usually accompanied by another repeated representing the message footer or the closing as the codebase you notice the string popping up more and more until the bell goes what to turns out all been taught the create a manifest constant or a static final string or depending on the thereby giving the common string a and replace all instances of the string by use of the even a name for this refactoring in martin replace magic number with symbolic duplication duplication in the repeated text of the but in the repeated use of the the resulting code still contains the original by hiding the string behind a my feeling is that made the code less readable right approach after using inline constant to put the original strings back into the code is to look at the context in which each of those strings chances are there will be only a small number of kinds of use of the string perhaps every time a reply message is for if the message has a header and a for look for ways to create an object that builds the with a hook to a function that supplies the message ninety percent of the time that kind of approach but on the odd occasion when it look for ways to encapsulate the string in a simple and then push the surrounding code onto that in either case the result after is that the string is present inline in the but the behavioural context in which that string exists now has a name hopefully a name that is also meaningful in the domain and the domain knowledge or policy represented by the associated code is no longer

 a different you need to be very careful to distinguish between encryption and https is nobody in the middle can see the message in plain is a mail transport protocol that encrypts the message while the but the message is unencrypted when sitting on a mail server ready to be delivered to the next system in the that protects you from wiretappers but not bad actors or people who have compromised that the valid argument is that the mail server needs to see the message headers to know what to do with the but a lot of people think that the message is always is another a lot of people had heard that the messages were encrypted between but realize that the message encrypted on the first and last it not unless you could guarantee that the endpoints were running the necessary it take long for some actors to realize that they could run tor gateways and capture a lot of traffic from people who run their own encryption need to be very careful to verify the type of encryption offered by your a lot of the time your protocols already support encryption channels and it may be easiest to just force people to use them even if that way covered if somebody is and accidently turns off if some node is given a court order to eavesdrop on your

 a few you either get an inefficient or you get poor code with xss not met a bbcode implementation yet that fails to and it better in this to only match using a validation is it better to use and a then ascertain whether or not the input is a valid would take the you need the callback anyway to do the not possible to be secure with only simple string drop the sanitisation in whilst doing about functions like within a actually you need is about encoding query which what you need it be safer to write a is not really amenable to regex because a recursive language which regex also cannot many bbcode holes are caused by nesting and misnesting for come out as something are many other traps that generate broken code to an including xss on various bbcode looking for principles and best you need a language that you can you need the number of possible tags that can be put inside other arbitrary nesting really possible to special characters for and html tag to distinguish them from real angle brackets that should appear as such in the i use ascii control codes previously filtered any control characters out at the user input the string being processed on these control characters on content between these two control so that you never end up letting a bbcode span reach inside a tag or over a tag you have bbcode spans reaching through tag boundaries work from the outside doing large block elements first and working inwards to links and finally bold and process a block at a if starting a new on a no bbcode tags can span between the two separate still damned hard to get a proper parser is much more likely to be

 a line of code in language that line is written once and likely to be read many more times potentially of so proficiency in a language in large reading for a corpus of programs written in how quickly can you read the programs and understand what they are of the available i think since there is an arbitrary number of commonly used libraries that are created while you are learning even the libraries for many languages today have thousands of distinct concepts and tens of thousands of how the features of the language are a property of a given implementation of the language rather than the language but i think it does knowing that regular expressions are often implemented as state machines knowing the theory for is pretty relevant to understanding of regular expression though knowing how java byte code works has never had any relevance in java applications worked i guess some languages have a cleaner separation from their possible implementations than this may be a key difference between high and low level you have a particular language in a good test is to look at serious examples in for the case of reading the linux gnu os postgresql or and out how they is not only an indication but can be good there was that one assignment about static analysis of but the actual solution could have been written in

 a look at reactive there are a number of frameworks for this in haskell know about other most of which are based around the basic idea is to represent relationships between values and so for example you would write haskell arrow notation using no particular velocity expression of gravity position integrate second line declares the relationship between position and the arrow operators are syntactic sugar for a bunch of library calls that tie everything later on you might say something groundlevel getgroundlevel altitude getaltitude crashed lifta2 altitude declare that if your altitude is less than the ground level at your position then you have just as with the other variables is not just a single its a stream of that is why the function is used to the comparison operator from simple values to is not a problem in this inputs are time varying values such as joystick x and while the image on the screen is simply another time varying at the very top level your entire simulator is an arrow from the inputs to the then you call a function that converts the arrow into an io action that runs the you write this in lisp you will probably find yourself creating a bunch of macros that basically so it might be worth just finding out about arrows to start

 a proxy server is setup properly to avoid the detection of proxy you be able to proxy servers supply headers as others but those are not present on proxies meant to completely hide the will need to employ several detection such as proxy header and perhaps ip heuristics to detect such check out for some information on this also consider using a proxy blacklist they are published by many nothing is you can employ the above tactics to avoid most simple but at the end of the day merely a series of packets forming a and the protocol was not developed with ideas on in mind that many corporations deploy company wide proxies for various and if you simply block proxies as a general rule you necessarily limit your and that may not always be these proxies usually announce themselves with the appropriate headers you may end up blocking legitimate rather than users who are good at hiding

 a python there is no only purpose of ssmtp is to wrap the smtp protocol in the sendmail that it provides a program that accepts the same and inputs as the sendmail most of the options do but behind the instead of processing the email it sends the message to an smtp this is for systems that need to have a program perhaps because they understand smtp for i think older versions of php had this and even in recent versions it might still be easier to configure php to use the sendmail interface the program than to use smtp used php in a little not sure about the current in python the situation is you have a builtin library that makes it easy to use smtp whereas using requires you to invoke the module which is somewhat clunky and also very dependent on things that are not part of so basically there is no reason not to use

 a release build is typically much harder that debugging a debug in general need some understanding of x86 assembler and likely spend some time looking at the disassembly this tends to be the only way to figure out what line of code you are really on since in a release build with optimizations on the compiler may do significant inlining and instruction in addition i find the debugger frequently fails to correctly report values of if you need to know a value and you are not sure the debugger is go into the disassembly window and find the memory location or register it is located pdb files can be stored in a symbol check out up a symbol for a good every product we build on a build machine publishes the symbols to our symbol so we can always debug any crash dumps we receive from

 a series of incoming i want to assign each one to a bucket as it comes the bucket can either be a new one that has never been used of which there are an infinite or it can be an existing if i look at the number of buckets with one the number with the number with i want those bucket counts to follow an exponential i hope saying that correctly if of the buckets have 1 then should have should have in the number of buckets of size k should be as many as the number of buckets of size and the fraction of buckets that are size 1 should be to make the math work out i knew the number of items in it would be know how many buckets of each so i can just pile the the items into as many buckets of each size as i or if i were just generating bucket be easy even if i know the total in each new bucket has probability of being size of being size size size i am processing so as i get an item i need to choose a either an existing or a new if i make a new then i get one more of size but if i choose an existing one of size then i get one more bucket of size and one of size so what should the probability of choosing a bucket of size k be k can be zero to indicate making a new and how does it relate to am doing this to generate test data where i only know the mean number of items per bucket it turns know the number of items in and think that the exponential distribution of bucket sizes is realistic for my probably making it more complicated than it needs to but i was surprised because i thought it would be maybe it but just missing i figure out how to google exponential distribution of bucket

 a tree is just a special type of graph called a directed acyclical so first and depth first traversal both work on a could write out a detailed explanation of the differences between breadth and depth first but probably get it wrong not a heavy guy it to say that the only difference between breadth and depth first traversal is the order in which you process the breadth first you can think of as adding vertices to a depth first you can think of as adding the vertices to a when it comes time to process the vertices been added to their respective data you dequeue or pop the stack to get the next vertex to clever versions of depth first traversal use recursion to process the vertices instead of adding them to a have no idea whether this was helpful or quick google search know whether it was breadth or depth finds which seems pretty good at describing the differences between bfs and i can also recommend steve algorithm design if you want to get a more in depth

 a type parameter is one which is allowed to vary down as the class is subtyped vary with hence the more is a subtype of because is a subtype of this means that you may provide an instance of when a value of type is this is really a very intuitive way for generics to but it turns out that it is unsound the type when used in the presence of mutable this is why generics are invariant in brief example of unsoundness using java arrays are erroneously arr new just assigned a value of type to an array of type for reasons which should be this is bad type system actually allows this at compile the jvm will throw an at type system prevents this problem because the type parameter on the class is invariant is rather than that there is another type of variance known as this is very important as it explains why covariance can cause some contravariance is literally the opposite of parameters vary with it is a lot less common partially because it is so though it does have one very important def the variance annotation on the type this declaration as a whole means that is contravariant in and covariant in we can derive the following that must be a subtype the same of whereas it is the opposite for and in this can be read as the function is a subtype of another function if the parameter type of is a supertype of the parameter type of while the return type of is a subtype of the return type of reason for this rule is left as an exercise to the reader think about different cases as functions are like my array example from your knowledge of and you should be able to see why the following example will not def problem is that is while the function expects its type parameter to be is varying the wrong interestingly we could solve this problem by making contravariant in but then the return type would be invalid as the function expects its return type to be only two options here are to make losing the intuitive properties of or add a local type parameter to the method which defines as a lower is now you can imagine that is varying but is able to vary upward with respect to since is its with this method we can have be covariant and everything works that this trick only works if we return an instance of which is specialized on the type if you try to make things break down since you end up trying to assign values of type to a variable of type which is disallowed by the whenever you have you need to have a mutator of some which requires a method parameter of a certain which with the implies covariance works with immutable data since the only possible operation is an which may be given a covariant return

 about to start creating a new website that has standard user management login and handling customer details my own looking for the most efficient way to do i know quite have looked into drupal as a starting point and found it too cumbersome for my and phpcake seems not to be efficient because spend time learning the platform instead of developing i would love to but not seems that what i need is a skeleton of php site that simply handles users surprisingly i find you recommend a starting point such as an open source website code that i can easily cut the user management part or another option which is more streightforward than learning a new starting point for a website with user management

 access to git and i need to incorporate a repository into two separate project repositories while minimizing the overhead of people on either project need the ability to easily branch off their mainline trunk while also branching off the the user modifies the repo and ready to their edits into their mainline trunk their edits will also be regressed against the other mainline to ensure that their edits are compatible with both know this is relatively easy to do with git except for the mechanism that does the continuous integration into a mainline which is homebrew scripts but is there an easy way to do this in both subversion and almost solves my subversion but what if the external repository in there an equivalent to or for can this be done with post clone i think i figured out how to do if you need to pull the common repo into both subversion and you need to have the common reuse repo in subversion so you can use like emk for bitkeeper you need to create a trigger which knows to do a checkout command from a subversion do you incorporate shared ip into multiple projects while still allowing easy

 adding the nsurlrequestreloadignoringlocalandremotecachedata parameter you are instructing the local cache and any proxy servers which may handle the request between your client and the target server that they are not to return their own version of the response i think the here is that the remotecache is likely to be a proxy and you are just identifying that the request should always reach the real server and not a proxied the parameter you are inferring that your application already has a previous copy of the request and so is only interested in actually receiving data from the server if it has that is why you are getting a response of not from the behaviour does seem as you are explicitly instructing the client not to use its own which would imply that you would want to discard anything in there and certainly not use it as a reference for any subsequent i believe the advanced cache parameters are provided to allow the developer to handle their own level of be notified if data been updated on the server so they can avoid needless

 advice do only even consider beta on a brickable development a few reasons beta in the traditional sense the google so not done but not all the new features are complete or functioning right and all subject to a one way you go now clever hackers have figured out difficult ways to downgrade and you may be able to work through or all software in the app store is ready to run on there seems to be some bugs in mediaplayer at the in other not completely backward compatible so reports are that facebook and other popular apps are there will be more beta releases so be prepared to spend time with more bug and potentially a dead in the beta cycle there was a period of time where the beta expired and there was no new release available shutting down devices for a upgrade your only device to unless you love skating away on the thin ice of a new that in the dev program and have on a touch and it will make many many happy developers and ever more happy and only scratched the surface of the new	
 advice is sound if you are you need to worry about freeing the memory since the system will reclaim it exception to that is shared memory segments at least under system v shared those segments can persist longer than the program that creates option not mentioned so far is to use an memory allocation built on top of standard if the entire application uses a single your cleanup code can release that and all is freed at apache portable runtime provides a pools feature which i believe is david interfaces and provides an memory allocation written one that you could use if you wanted you can think of this as garbage a general memory every time you allocate memory you should understand which code is going to release it and when it can be there are a few standard the simplest is in this released before this function this keeps the memory largely under control you run too many iterations on the loop that contains the memory and scopes it so that it can be made available to the current function and the functions it you have to be reasonably sure that the functions you call are not going to squirrel away pointers to the data and try to reuse them later after released and reused the next standard pattern is exemplified by and a function that allocates a pointer to some which can be used by the calling and then released when the program has finished with this often becomes very similar to the first case it is usually a good idea to call in the function that called of the remaining are somewhat

 agree with everyone so in that there is no native css namespace capability and that if you have control the to edit your html then the best way to automate the process would be to write a script to parse the html pulling in and replace any existing or classes with a modified becomes could accomplish this with some creative regular although it would get trickier if javascript code that would need to be modified as far as performance this would be a big hit depending on the size of the file and probably want to cache the or rewrite the original me know if you decide to go that the idea actually sounds a bit intriguing and could have a place in my

 all in a gui queue are best done by a single thread as there is an implied order in the events thus they need to be done which is why most gui apps have a single thread to handle though potentially multiple events to create them it does not preclude the event thread from creating a job and handling it off to a worker pool on a socket can potentially by done in parallel as each request is stateless and can thus by done independently i know that is over simplifying jobs were each job is independent and placed on this is the classic case of using a set of worker each thread does a potentially long operation independently of the other on completion comes back to the queue for another

 all sound like discrete actions and thus not particularly restful in typically i will have a list action with filtering this filtering could be done via ajax since what it is returning is basically the same clicking on a particular item might bring me to a details view with an edit i might also include an edit button in the in which case clicking it would bring me to an details page in edit and edit would all be different and have different clicking the list button in view or edit would return me to the list clicking the save button in edit would return me to the view for that item this provides confirmation that the item has been errors in edit render the edit view with appropriate rule of thumb is to use ajax when the context of the view but a full request when a new action is this helps to keep the interface of you can do it any way you but mvc makes doing restful urls easier and restful urls make it easier for the user to bookmark a page to get back to it easily precisely because they map to a particular action on a particular data

 all you need is a source of it have to come from the same or even from a database at i would use because it is free and you have a single web a sql express database on the web server with a single table with a single autoincrementing field insert a record into this get the and pass that onto your database layer as the pk of the table in you have multiple web a pain to but you can use the same trick by setting appropriate increment and seed for three web	
 all your data are of constant then you need any separator between so you could directly send the binary for the be sent 0x0b 0xc4 0x14 bytes for float am assuming one byte representations for sensor and two bytes for time and 4 bytes for you need to send the row will be now be of constant length and the receiver will have to do the convertion the embedded device can easily send data in this there is also the problem of encapsulating the data in a so that the receiver when a message you usually do this by adding a header and a message ascii characters stx and etx are used and 0x03 i the problem is that these values can also appear in the message so you need to add another layer in your when the byte 0x02 or 0x03 is to be send it on the receiver a single 0x02 byte denotes the start of the additional 0x02 and 0x03 bytes within the message body must be if the communication link is you also need to add a techniques are typically used by serial protocols like	
 all your javascript into one external file can do this dynamically and save the cached that that file use the mtime of a preconfigured file for the file if the client supports a far futures expires header on the referring to ajax libraries is another way to handle this that falls under the heading of a cdn delivery the idea being that the file is stored in multiple plallllces and the client will download the closest that result will be hard or just awkward to combine with other techniques and found that doing multiple external loads this way completely erodes any perceived benefit your only external so i use the method listed above	
 allocated any space in your output array to put the copy need to use malloc to allocate some space before using sprintf to copy into that char char stringsize use strlen etc to calculate the size you and for get space for the animal forget to call on that allocated memory when you are done with	
 allocation simply means not allocating a resource until it is actually this is common with singleton but strictly any time a resource is allocated as late as you have an example of lazy delaying allocation of a resource until you actually need you can decrease startup and even eliminate the allocation entirely if you never actually use the in you could a resource you expect to need which can make later execution more efficient at the expense of startup and also avoids the possibility of the allocation failing later in program following code provides an example of a class widget private widget public static widget if singleton new return private note that this code in most access to the method should be synchronized in some similar perhaps more concept is

 allows you to create structured containers of called which can be of one this can help with building an application as it is easier to maintain and if done properly reduce code oop does add a bit overhead but it really noticeable and is outweighed by the unmaintainablity of procedural if your writing a big def go especially if it is going to be worked on by many say you are designing a simple you could create a page the page object is responsible for going to the database and getting various settings for the such as meta title or even the number of certain on the page and their type as a calendar a you can create another say that extends index would be the index or home if you had a catalog of you could have catalog class extend since both your catalog section and your homepage need to get data from the database concerning the metadata of the page and the basic construction of the having 1 object that does it already for you in both of these page does all the work and gets the page data from the loads it into which are then accessible in both your index class and your catalog you have to write code to go into the database and get it again in each page you there are other ways to do this such as with an you will find yourself making less mistakes and for you can define an abstract method in your page this means that this method must be defined in any object that extends so say you created a function as abstract in your page when you do this you create an empty when you create your index you have to create a function the intent on filling it such as accessing the variables defined in the page class and using it to set the actual elements on the or view you are or you get a php you are working with other people to get your project abstract methods will tell the you need to define these functions in any code you this forced the application to be you cannot go to frameworks such as mvc formats if you do not do while it is not necessary to go to mvc and there is some it does separate out all the components of the application and is necessary in environments where many people marketing work on the same

 alone is not because users will still be able to edit it if they really you should use that will ensure that try to populate the element from and double check that you have to make sure the values you are getting into the databases can never contain this if you would like your element to be displayed in a different way than just with you can do that by changing the element	
 alone the code that at least for you can find a code generator that really makes it to develop new then i see how it could pose a risk or be hard to to the better to generate repetitive code than to write it really just a you should find a way to extract the repetitive aspects in a way that allows you to manually write use for data access so that you have to write crud operations for each domain object and instead just specify how mapped to db

 also a big fan of using process of ruling out variables tremendously simplifies the debugging often the very first thing that should to be really effective technique is to roll back to your last working version if possible and try this can be extremely powerful because it gives you solid footing to proceed more a variation on this is to get the code to a point where it is with less than not working with more very important to not just try this increases your despair because it never rather make 50 runs to gather information about the bug rather take a wild swing and hope it

 also worth noting that some programs behave differently when run by a user at the command vs being part of a batch from another the actual difference is whether a terminal attached to the spawn part of the expect extension to sets things up so the executed program sees itself as run by a and then adds functionality to allow the tcl program to interact with the external program in a convenient way matching output via regular expressions and branch off those things run via spawn are run exec command is a core tcl command that runs the other returning it does not do any of the complicated setup that spawn but can be very handy for just running a program and seeing output return things run by exec by run but an ampersand at the end of the command causes it to be run in the background like traditional shell open while generally used to can also be used to run external by preceding the command name with the pipe you tell it to run an external and gain access to file descriptors to interact with the resulting this is sort of a middle ground between exec and with much more interaction with the process but without the complicated environmental setup that spawn it can be extremely handy for interacting with programs that require input but are still fairly well setup for	
 always best to load as much as is reasonable on the initial if your requires that you add stuff dynamically via ajax then i can see you what i you are wondering what the practice would be to keep your javascript concise and in on file and not scattered throughout your you are saying that currently your scripts are scattered throughout your page because when you are loading in or whatever they have the js along with them so that when they load their script is run the problem is that you want specific events to be triggered instantiating a lightbox or sorting a when these views are loaded by using the one omnipotent super global js if that sounds then what do any views being loaded in assume you have the code you you loaded some content into the div a when the page is fully and then you wanted to sort that table without putting the script to do so in the html that is returned from you could have the following code in you main or whatever your sorting method uses jquery custom events and the i tested this out but it should work in i tested this and it works perfectly using jquery

 am starting to explore linq to objects but want to know how application design can best accommodate linq to an example an application displays female employees only and the employee table in the database contains data for both male and female the application builds a sql statement to retrieve only the female employees from the database and places them into an object which is then passed around the application for display get the greatest leverage from linq to i assume you would first have to obtain all the data for employees and then apply linq to filter the object to only display the female the benefit is that you can continue to query the employees without touching the database is a basic example but the point i am trying to make is where does the line between benefit and efficient execution time if the employee table has can see the benefit of linq but in my i am convinced that you first need to put all the data into an object from which you can then use linq to all the data may be too costly to make it worthwhile when i can just query the database again each time i need a different subset of to objects philosophy of

 an interesting but like bobince you can only process one attribute per this regex will match everything up to the attribute interested you use as your replacement string to plug back in everything but the approach requires you to make a separate pass over the string for each of your target and at the beginning of each pass you have to create and compile the not very but if the string too large it should be a much bigger problem is that it catch duplicate if there are two attributes on a only catch the first i were doing this in i would probably use the regex to match the target then use a matchevaluator to remove all of the target attributes at but if the string really is no excuse for not using tools to process is what xml was

 answer depends on the order you need them you pretty much have a choice of and thus have obvious analogues in breadth first and depth first and in general have trouble beating if you constraint the problem a there are a number of old fashioned algorithms for storing trees of arbitrary data as we used them a lot in the fortran one of them had the key trick being to store the children of say a2 and at the problem is that if your tree is sparse you waste and the size of your tree is limited by the array if i remember this you get the elements in order by simple do a look at knuth volume there is a ton of that stuff in

 answer is when a closure captures a variable in is what is happening when your lambda refers to the variable the compiler applies a pretty precise rule about how to do the if the captured variable is within the same as determined by the surrounding and then the value of that variable will be captured as it if it is outside the then only a reference to that variable will be in your original the variable had already cycled through the entire loop to its last but if you make the modification mehrdad then you are capturing a variable in your same so the individual value of the variable will be embedded into your giving you the results you the you may but the variable is in the same but not because under the the compiler turns a into something like this is very just to show what happens with the var iterator your loop code your iterator for a will always be in a scope outside of the one where your loop code

 answer question 2 start or stop you just need to use the and the example code is right in the msdn question could have it poll a web service periodically if you want to do an you can set up the service for remoting and have it just listen on a tcp port for function then write a windows app that can use remoting to call the had to do this for a legitimate business app and it works very i would be very irresponsible if i include this setting up a computer so that it can execute arbitrary code is a idea and should be done very just because it be done mean it be if you go the web service how are you going to ensure that someone tamper with the web service and get malicious code to how do you know someone mess with your and point the app to their own web in the remoting how to you ensure that some other developer just create a proxy of their all amazed that microsoft even allows the to be used in a you can literally do anything you want with including launching the cmd shell and executing system urge you to seriously consider if this is truly necessary to you may be better served installing vnc or using remote or another app for remote other question you need to answer is the application be visible to the user on that remote if then you need to ensure that the service is set up to run under that you for launch word using the local system and it would never be visible to the person logged into that

 answer your last two by no memory leaks in managed there are two kinds of leaks that can are released when no references to the object are if you still have a reference to an it will not be this happens for instance when you throw away a reference to an object that has registered for an event if you manually unregister the event handler use a weak the event will still reference the so it will not be released although you have no obvious reference to it resources can be a wrapper for unmanaged resources implements idisposable and will free the resource when you call if you just throw away the it will not release the resource and therefore leak two rules of thumb any event handler when you release an or use a weak reference for that on explained a class exposes a dispose call if you use the object only use the using if you have members that implement implement idisposable yourself and call the dispose in your

 answers address the way the reference count is stored is stored in a shared memory for all that hold the same native but most elude the problem of easiest way of leaking memory with reference counted pointers is creating as an a doubly linked list where all the pointers are with at least two elements is guaranteed not to be even if external pointers are the internal pointers will still and the reference count will not reach that at with the most easiest solution to the cycle problem is mixing counted with weak pointers that do not share the ownership of the pointers will share both the resource and the additional when you use weak the reference count is there is a shared pointer reference count and a weak pointer reference the resource is released whenever the shared pointer count reaches but the information is left alive until the last weak pointer is the doubly linked the external reference is held in a while the internal links are just whenever there are no external references the elements of the list are deleting the weak at the end all weak references have been deleted and the last weak pointer to each resources frees the is less confusing than the above text try again	
 answers by and are mathematically but i am wondering if you are doing too much you just have to make certain your array is big calculate with 53 weeks with 5 working ergo 265 since a year is always 52 and a fraction weeks just rounding up to the next full integer will always give you enough your array elements are not enourmously big in memory you can live with the small amount of waste because of elements that you will never be good enough is good you will have saved at least 10 minutes working out the exact solution what i would probably need at least which you can spend	
 answers given are but i do mine a little you might want to consider a couple the batch end it will keep all your to be only valid during the current and will not leave vars left around named like or any other variables you set during the that could interfere with the next run of the batch you can do something set other trick is if you only provide or 2 use the shift command to move so the one you are looking for is always at process the first shift and then do it this you are not windows batch processor is more powerful than people give it credit done some crazy stuff with including calculating even across month and year boundaries including leap and you really want to get you can call functions in the batch but really for a different and name your batch files they are this

 any of the currently popular browsers have particular problems xmlhttprequest responses that i need to be aware like to be able to include xmlhttprequest queries on every page as a method of dynamically loading content or behaviour relevant to the type of but wanted to make sure that the resources it receives from the server could be if the server sent the right was concerned to read article which that browsers such as firefox do not cache any content obtained via and that it always requests new data is sent completely and no regardless of headers sent by the that article is very old i even remember a firefox so what are the considerations i need to make for current popular browsers and is there any trick for when i specifically responses to be clarify my by i mean where the server issues freshness information the form of a directive or an and the browser stores a copy of the response in its cache along with an expiry so that future requests for the same resource issued from subsequent pages can be satisfied from the browser cache without the need for any contact with the server at all major browsers do this correctly for most but heard that firefox cannot do this for xmlhttprequest what asking is if anyone knows of cases where any of the modern browsers do not cache responses according to the spec when using browsers have problems caching xmlhttprequest

 application delegate is not an application it should inherit from not that is a its method always returns the first nsapplication or any throwing away any subsequent objects you the nib may be calling you ended up setting your application object as its own the object you intended to make the delegate died in the second call to and the application object took its the application object to be an instance of your subclass would also have but still have the application as its own which is unclean and possibly dangerous may privately implement some of its delegate methods as just notification handler the only correct solution is to make your app delegate class not inherit from

 are 2 main approaches to building an rcp app you are using rcp just for the platform features the application code will be isolated from rcp conventions and libraries as much as possible for the actual app biz your app is completely immersed in you try to reuse rcp wherever possible have tried out option in this the experience is very similar to java you might want to try this option the advantages are swt is very well integrated into you dont need to run into hoops to get it i would recommend swt over swing any day as it is very easy for an average programmer to create a responsive and swt app while it takes a swing expert to create a decent swing app with a client the ability to is very eclipse automatically offers this stuff you still need to learn how the eclipse classloader this is to ensure you can explicitly load resources from your jars in the correct way it is not you will need to package the jvm along with the and invoke the jvm on startup using relative naming

 are 3 options for creating a chat and sockets for the frontend and a programming language for the for the recommend java or because they are multithreading and possible to do it with php php really do efficient multithreading and is generally not really suited for this is an option if you need high and probably not what looking ajax and this case all clients are constantly example ever 2 polling if something new has it feels strange because you only get responses at those it puts quite a strain on your server and you know an application uses this technique because the browser constantly this is a suboptimal ajax and works with and has long running scripts in the not the best but most of the time better than pulling and it works and is used in several well known chat this technique is sometimes called if you need a chat app for production install an existing programming chat applications is not you just want to learn start with a simple then try to program one using ajax and most probably need a tough i successfully implemented a very simple solution that works with text files for fun i certainly use it in is my but pretty not possible to create a chat app without a backend just frontend javascript you want to know how the data pushing is look at the source async multipart is what you want var httpreq new sync multipart sync wait until data false null event if 4 else error is called data not just once like in regular not using jquery or prototype so the a bit obese this is really old the server side 1 print print print print first part of request print 3 print print print second part of request print the if got a architecture like in the you need kind of external storage like databases or you could rely on memory by writing your own http server with but not recommend it for serious not really but probably a bit out of the scope of your question made a got everything mixed because been a long time i actually did something like here are the responses only work with mozilla browsers and therefore are of limited comet mean traditional singlepart but held an infinite loop and until there is data so the browser has 1 for every action the worst not one request every x even if nothing

 are a couple of features mono has that is highly you can break it apart in tiny little pieces and only deploy those parts that you want is you can host it inside your to allow users to script it from a safe managed sandboxed the most famous example of this is which hosts mono inside the apache and is how is implemented in for this feature goes great together with the modularization mentioned has already been static goes great together with as a service is another anders hejlsberg has been talking about it for a and just maybe it is going to be ready for mono already has and actually had it for de lead developer also has an initiative that he calls and which extends the cli in ways not possible with other cli implementations so embrace and has three which gives safe and controlled access to the simd instructions of the underlying cpu sse on intel or altivec on used for games and bit array which are allowed by the ecma but mono is the only vm that actually provides used in most this is actually the first time that mono strays outside the realm of the long array indices are perfectly valid as per the and also works on every cli compliant implementation but needs special support from the vm that is not part of either cli or this is used for game logic and in second

 are a number of ways you can do in your main thread to wait in a blocking fashion for each thread to in a polling fashion generally discouraged to wait until each thread has for each thread in call to call a method in your and program each thread to throw an uncaught exception when it locks or synchronizers or mechanisms from create a listener in your main and then program each of your threads to tell the listener that they have to implement idea one way is to first create an interface threadcompletelistener void thread create the following abstract class notifyingthread extends thread private final new public final void threadcompletelistener public final void threadcompletelistener private final void for listener public final void try finally public abstract void then each of your threads will extend and instead of implementing it will implement thus when they they will automatically notify anyone waiting for in your main class the one that starts all the threads at least the object waiting for modify that class to and immediately after creating each thread add itself to the list of thread1 new add ourselves as a start the as each thread your method will be invoked with the thread instance that just completed that better would be to rather than for as extending thread is usually discouraged in new but coding to your if you change the class to implement then you have to change some of your code that manages which is pretty straightforward to

 are controls look at the inheritance and a form itself have a whole lot of overhead in and of it creates a native but about should drive your decision is how you use and display your ui elements in your forms are conducive to many ui and what most developers are familiar the designer supports them and hiding and closing forms is a well often used paradigm that works just you have the load penalty whenever a form is created as it creates all of its contained but going to pay that even if a the child controls have to be created in either might argue that forms require that you recreate them every but not if you use showdialog or hide instead of you can reuse your forms and pay the price the advantage here is that the form holds your controls in teh collection and manages all of that for so you have little to worry about with the gc and remembering what roots you have usercontrol paradigm is more complex you have to manage loading and unloading controls yourself to keep memory pressure complexity also increases cost cost to cost to and likely cost to however there are some clear advantages to usercontrols in some scenarios if you use an pattern and some form of framework that handlesyour a usercontrol makes a really good view with the form becoming the workspace for the is a classic example of and so is the for the which is it depends on how and where using the how your team is already doing and how architected the solution plugging in in the is no one right

 are correct to be a good rule of thumb for design is that whenever you use a construct like instanceof or you should start thinking about moving methods up or or extracting new and john have both presented good ideas on very different directions you could but both right in that you should definitely move in some object oriented design is there to help your code become more legible by making branching for different sorts of behaviors more examining what sort of object looking at and determining what to do based on that can defeat the purpose of using should also warn you that an interface exactly an empty there are some significant differences between abstract classes with abstract methods and instead of thinking of an interface as an empty think of an interface as a by implementing an your class promises to provide each of the methods listed in the	
 are current for systematic build numbering and version number management in java to manage build numbers systematically in a distributed development to maintain version numbers in source available to the runtime to properly integrate with source to more automatically manage version numbers repository to integrate with continuous build are quite a number of tools and ant build system has a task that will maintain a build but not clear how to manage this with concurrent developers using or good and helpful partial or specific answers have appeared so summarize a few of it sounds to me like there is not really a strong on rather a collection of overlapping find my summaries and some resulting questions that folks might try to answer as to please provide comments if doing this you are using versioning of a specific checkout comes along for the build numbering can exploit this to create a unique build number that identifies the specific which we are using for legacy provide quite this level of manual intervention with tags gets you part way you are using maven as your build there is support for producing a version number from the as well as a release module for automatically producing use for a variety of but this helps those who to you are using as your build the following task description can help produce a java file capturing build which can then be folded into your build in a number of expanded on this idea to include thanks and maven hudson and cruise provide easy means for getting build numbers into a or into a is this enough to keep it from being tampered with intentionally or is it better to compile it into a class at build build numbering should be in a continuous integration system like to we have taken this but it does crack open the release engineering how does a release are there multiple buildnumbers in a is there a meaningful relationship between buildnumbers from differing what is the objective behind a build is it used for is it used primarily by developers to disambiguate between multiple builds during or more for qa to determine what build an if the goal is in theory this is what a release version number should provide why answer this as a part of your answers it will help illuminate the choices you have is there a place for build numbers in manual is this so problematic that everyone should be using a ci should build numbers be checked in to the if the goal is reliably and unambiguously identifying a particular how to cope with a variety of continuous or manual build systems that may should a build number be short and sweet monotonically increasing so that easy to stick into file names for easy to refer to in or should it be long and full of machine please provide details about how the assignment of build numbers fits into your larger automated release maven we know this is done and but not all of us have drunk the quite really like to flesh this out into a complete at least for the concrete example of our so someone could build a complete strategy based on this mark as anyone who can give a description for this particular case cvs tagging relevant ci config and release procedure that folds the build number into the release such that programmatically if you want to for another particular configuration link to the question from 23 oct accepted the answer because i think a reasonable while several of the other answers also include good if someone wants to take a crack at synthesizing some of these with consider accepting a different the only concern i have with is that it produce a reliably serialized build number it depends on a local clock at the system to provide unambiguous build which jul now include a class like the this allows the version numbers to be compiled into the final different forms of the version info are emitted in logging archived output and used to trace our analysis of output products to a specific final class svn should fill this out with the latest tag when checked private static final string private static final string 325 private static final pattern private static final string private static final string private static final string private static final string static matcher m if svn svn else if this necessary in this so but it is since we call it trunk in the real else public static string return answers a formatter string descriptor for the app version string public static string return svn public static string return public static string return public static string return public static string return public static final string stringbuilder sb new return comments if this deserves to become a wiki and version numbering for java projects

 are defining the bar two things are there is no parametric type involved in that the foo and t members have a single say that is fixed for the if passed a foo that you expect to assign to it must be a if this is all then not part of the public interface everything has a specific not sure what you mean by as there are no free type if you mean universally how do you reconcile the fact that bar has no parametric so must have been given a concrete type for each of there is a parametric type involved in it may not be obviously in the public but perhaps you pass in a so you want to have a bar class be instantiated with more than a single as this is in the public and you need to make bar parametric in t with this gives you some form of universal quantification for the all types this definition is

 are some reasons related to schedule and resources of implementation of properties and understanding all of the ramifications and intersections with other language features is a large task similar to the size of various java 5 language i think the real reason sun is not pushing properties is the same as there is no consensus on what the implementation should look or there are many competing alternatives and people who are passionate about properties disagree about crucial parts of the perhaps more there is a significant lack of consensus about whether the feature is wanted at while many people want there are also many people that think necessary or useful i think people see properties as far less crucial to their daily life than swing history

 are two one from ssms and the other using sql server 2008 books move an existing index to a different filegroup or object connect to an instance of the sql server engine and then expand that expand the database that contains the table the specific and then the table in which the index belongs and then expand the index to be moved and then select the index properties dialog select the storage the filegroup in which to move the cannot move indexes created a unique or primary key constraint using the index properties dialog to move these you need drop the constraint using alter with the constraint option and then the constraint on the filegroup using alter with the add the table or index is select the partition scheme in to move the sql server to place an existing table on a different filegroup expand the database containing and then click the details the and then click design any and then click the tables in the table filegroup select the filegroup on which to place the in the text filegroup select a filegroup on which to place any and text more effective way is create a clustered index on if the table already has clustered you can use create index clause to recreate clustered index and move it to particular when a table a clustered the leaf level the index and the data pages of table essentially become one and the table must exist where clustered index so if create or recreate a the index on particular moving table to the new filegroup as can create the clustered index specifying the new filegroup for the on clause and that will move the table but if you have nonclustered indexes and want them on the other filegroup you must drop and recreate them also specifying the new filegroup in the on

 are two roles commonly described as assurance folks who assure that the quality plan is being developers who your question was focused on that the quality plan is being then then developers work that meets the quality plan and qa audits that the quality plan was your question is focused on who then you have a much of a quality plan in the first in this the developers need to integrate the testers into their create a quality and work according to that plan may involve some independent this can be done by having developer a write tests for developer it can also be done by having developer a write tests and peer review those tests before commencing idea is that developers write and check and test their own one development everyone codes some more than makes sure the developers really are doing that consistently and see who as a viable these are really you can either leverage them to grow some additional technical or squander them in a position where they spend a fair amount of time being beat up by users and arguing with way to leverage who is to start them out writing the then use them to fix the broken then code from someone then do design work on their are many ways to discourage these who one is to leave them guessing what the users do this by narrowing their knowledge of the process to just what they find in business analysis another is to put them in a position where they have to argue over the interpretation of business analysis documents with

 are valid choices depending on architecting for extensibility say a plugin model for different imagereaders then your factory class cannot know about all possible in that you go the route asking each implementer until you find one that can read that sometimes ordering does matter you may have a genericimagereader that can handle but a jpeg2000imagereader that is better at walking the imagereader implementers will stop at whichever is you may want to look at sorting the list of possible imagereaders if a if the list of imagereaders is finite and under your then you can go the more traditional factory in that the factory decides what to already coupled to the concrete implementations of imagereader by the so adding rules for each imagereader increase if the logic to pick a imagereader is mainly in the imagereader then to avoid duplication of you can still go the route but it could just be hardcoded which types you

 been experimenting with the remotesoft linker and mini deployment tools to create a single native executable need the framework from my managed one of the configurable features it has is if is available for the final the documentation for it says that typically only needed if using xml serialization modified my build process to use sgen to create the serialization and added the result to the references of each project in the solution that uses my xml the serialization classes are making it into the linked executable dlls combined into a single managed so i assume i have that configured my app still attempts to execute csc when it am i doing something wrong with the serialization resulting in it being recreated at or is my app doing something else that requires and how do i determine done some testing with a modified to keep the serialization files visible if generated by undoing the build time and it appears that i did have them properly created unless a different part of the framework that invokes csc at runtime and which has its results unhidden using a different flag i think the remotesoft tool is probably to i be certain though because the output executable leave any temps it creates visible even if the file it injested told it i used was elsewhere i saw examples using a value of but been able to find any difference between their is my application using csc during

 been observing some strange behavior with the following i use instead of the directly so i can the variable separately for each form if return return upon calling on a it will disable normal submit and then make an ajax post strange thing is that the form gets posted multiple as the alert will as you can preventing this by using a saved on the form and checking that variable to see if the form has already been further it seems that the culprit is the script returned by the ajax let me explain a bit what doing so more form gets posted to the and a script the script shows the form but this time with error messages for some note that the form is completely upon showing the new executes have to do that because when you click on the submit button the form is submitted no say a user submits the form and returned back with the appropriate errors alert is not then he submits it this time the alert is shown now he submits it one more and this time the alert is shown and so it would seem that the callback is being appended again and again with each but it be that by using the original form is kept as a ghost or in case the script returned by the form and other stuff submitted multiple times when using the callback and to post

 believe missed on some basic idea behind starts with reusable units of with an emphasis on creating the case of the rtf memo it meets the above criteria by handling a given set of data in such a way that your program and other objects within your program care how it does purpose is to show an accept manipulate that specific and pass that data on to another part of your idea behind being is simply that you can replace that memo control with another control which meets the same interface that you can instantiate let the user interact with and pull the data out when loosely coupled goes hand in hand with the idea of of which is the process of breaking a program into distinct features in order to reduce overlapping functionality and make easier to but they are not the same this was also one of the main drivers behind moving away from the procedural style of programming into as oop forces the programming to think in terms of related and discrete sounds like you are really asking about are many ways to achieve sometimes it involves keeping the processing and persistance layers separated the mvc design pattern for sometimes it is simply keeping related functions together in order to reduce which the rtf control already does by containing all of the functions necessary to manipulate the data so that you have further hope that

 best approach to migrating to a usable willing to break every application that currently uses the your options are because you change the existing structure very you think carefully about your motivations if you have an existing issue bug to an enhancement to then go ahead rarely worthwhile to monkey around with a working production system just to achieve an improvement that nonone else will ever note that this can play into your favour if an existing you can point out to management that the most way to fix things is to alter the database structure in this means you have management support for the changes and their backup if something turns pear practical thoughts one change at a and one make sure each change is correct before you move the old proverb of cut is automate never ever make the changes to the production system using sql server management write sql scripts that perform the entire change in one develop and test these against a of the database to make sure you get them use production as your test server you might accidentally run the script against use a dedicated test server the database size is under use sql server express running on your own the first step in any script should be to backup the so that got a way back if something does go if someone comes to you in twelve asking why feature of their application is need a history of the exact changes made to the database to help diagnosis and first good step is to keep all your change usually a good idea to keep the primary and foreign keys within the database and not revealed through the things that look like keys at a business level your work order have a disturbing habit of having introduce your keys as additional columns with appropriate but change the definitions of existing

 best to use a scripting language for this i find that powershell is well suited for situations like 1 is to find all of the actual files that are inlcuded in your csproj the following function will search a directory structure for all csproj files and return the set of files that are included in those param a gci foreach in foreach in if all you need to do is wrap that into a dictionary and then do a search in the directory gci

 best you would have to use rather than an explicit unless you want to restrict all multiple return values to be of the same type likely you would also be limiting the scope of the currently you can declare a variable at a higher scope and initialize it in an out with this the variable would go out of scope in the same block as its obviously this is usable in some but i want to enforce this as the general obviously you could leave the option in but chances are people are going to code for one approach or the

 birch has already answered my question original confusion was due to not understanding that can be used to find the character of a but just in case others are an explanation of what these functions are trying to is a upload behavior for using you can set any field in your model to behave as an upload like the above meioupload will treat the field named as an upload this model happens to be named so the upload directory would be the above configurations also specify that 2 thumbnails should be so if i were to upload an image named the following files would be saved on the thumbsizes labeled do not have their key appended to their the default images are also stored in the same since we want the default or thumbnails to overwrite one the author has created the following pair of are used to prevent filename conflicts when saving uploaded is used to add new reserved words when the default image is named something	
 bit more detail might be you have your program you then create an event the function call to use is that event has two signalled and choose the state it starts you can now on that which is to you can for example give that event to an operating system function call and then wait on that when the operating system is it will change the state of the event to signalled and your function call will if only one this much use you could just call the operating system function and wait for it to but if you have multiple threads and you want to communicate between them you make function calls to other what you do instead is communicate with the other tell it to do something and give it the and then until program can have called a which is a thread which reading the programs message you can send a message to a thread and it will automatically be read by that so one use is if you have a number of threads is to issue a termination message time to another is to let the thread know you want it to do something and a message can take two integer values as so you can pass over the handle to an so the thread can signal you when its you could have it send you a message when its it all depends on how you want to organize your code event based or message

 bloch deals with this topic extensively in effective his suggestions are illuminating and should apply to as well for the exceptions should be used for exceptional the reasons for this are for a given method to be maximally its input and output conditions should be maximally the second method is easier to use than the adds two positive addend1 greater than addend2 greater than additionexception if addend1 or addend2 is less than or equal to int throws addend1 0 throw new is else addend2 0 throw new is return addend1 adds two positive addend1 greater than addend2 greater than int int addend1 0 throw new is else addend2 0 throw new is return addend1 either you need to check to make sure that the caller is using your api but in the second you require it the soft exceptions will still be thrown if the user read the need to document need to test for it upon how aggresive unit testing strategy require the caller to handle three use point is that exceptions should be used as return largely because complicated not only your but the api as the right thing comes at a of the cost is that everyone needs to understand that they need to read and follow the hopefully that is the case

 bugs are fairly easily and easy to what do you do when you run into ones that are hard or impossible to repro under of app is a app that is furthermore complicated by the fact that it communicates with multiple clients via remoting and sometimes bugs that can take weeks to track and sometimes we even be sure that the problem is fixed because of inconsistent it could be that just coincidence that the issue been seen for a already have an error reporting system so if lucky and the bug throws an exception get a stack but even not always enough because not obvious from the stack for instance how a certain value turned out to be null this is especially true when an exception occurs in a worker thread is the case most then you have ones that even throw just unexpected but it only happens a small percentage of is in so some of the work is hidden but we have many 3rd party components that managed code and a fair amount of com interop so it still gets a little no straightforward answers since not asking about a specific bug but what are some general concepts principles and tactics to go about tackling these kinds of is some advice for debugging really hard to track down

 cannot assume that the parent constructor has been called because you have overridden this in your you would need to call as you if you change the class you are inheriting from you would obviously need to change you are using php5 then you can name your constructors this has the benefit of letting you easily call a parent constructor by doing in any derived class without specifying the parent class you can then rearrange your inheritance with less hassle and less danger of introducing obscure

 co workers are if one thread locks a resource and another thread attempts to use it then your thread pool goes not very good most people resolve this by creating new objects and passing them into paramaterized if you absolutely need to use the same object then you must implement some code that first checks to see if the resource is being used by another thread and then waits a little while before checking an example would be to create a isinuse bool that you always check then your thread sets it to true if it is using that then false when it is preventing other threads from attempting to use the underlying resource i hope this

 code is still not cart cart new new is because two threads can both get a of create new shopping cart and insert them into the one of them will meaning one will set the object used by future but the other will for this request use a totally different make this you would need to do something like following the idiom from the article you shoppingcart cart if cart new if the above if two threads using the same enter the loop at the same there is no data race that can cause them to use different address the part of the problem that brian goetz address in the namely how do you get the into the session in the first an easy and not way to do implement a session listener and put the empty objects into the session in its class sessioninitializer implements httpsessionlistener public void httpsession session new public void no special action method will be called once for each only when it is so this is an appropriate place to do any initialization that is needed for a the servlet spec does not require that there is a relationship between calling in your listener and calling your so this is apparently not guaranteed to be thread and can potentially vary in behavior between different servlet if there is even a chance that a given session can have more than one request in flight at a this is not safe in this you need to use a lock of some sort to initialize the you could do something like session ensure that the session is cartref if cartref new the above code has your session is the is guaranteed to be in the and in a you can either update the shopping cart object in the same synchronized block dispense with the all together just put the cart itself into the or you can update the with code shown earlier which is better depends on how much initialization you need to how long it will take to perform this on whether doing in the synchronized block will hurt performance too much is best determined with a not with a and so in my own i just use a synchronized block and use if i ever determined that synchronization was causing a liveness problem in my then i would potentially move some more expensive initializations out of synchronized blocks by using tricks like the httpsession thread are attribute thread safe	
 code look like that you should lock on the as otherwise threads fetching data may not get the most recent for complicated memory model i know of any ways around you could do odd stuff with lambda expressions and extension but it would be overkill should also strongly consider whether you want the individual properties to be it may be the right thing to do but i find that usually i need most types to be only a few types need to directly know about and they then take out appropriate locks while using the rather than the object doing the locking it does depend on what doing alternative for some cases is to use immutable types nice when you can do although if you need one thread to see the changes made in another need sort of volatility or

 coming across a weird design pattern using the repository and service the application constists of and some windows my repositories are using linq as my application evolves finding myself passing references to iwhateverservice service for i have iaccountservice which defines methods such as plan it seems like iaccountservice is the best place to put this method since servicing accounts the changeplan method needs to know several things before it can actually change the it has to know the current the list of available an instance to an ecommerce service interface for thought having changeplan method accept all of the required services in the iaccountservice but the requirement of these other services is a matter of implementation and be part of the interface now i find myself creating a huge constructor for accountservice taking an instance of and this feel right at take this obviously iaccountservice contains a simple method to retrieve a account by account there are several times when i just need to call this method i go to create my and it wants instances of all these other services not needing validation for this feels i could pass but only becuase i know the implementation use them for just this to avoid instantiating the services everywhere i need i created a static class called which has static i call these methods around the the seems ok but i shake the feeling that this is my disconnect anyone got any code is riddled with service

 common and simple solution to this problem that feels like a hack but is fairly portable is to add a randomly generated query string to each request for the dynamic for example the point of view of the the same file is but from the point of view of the browser no caching can be random number generation can happen either on the server when serving the page make sure the page itself or on the client will need to verify whether your can cope with this

 company develops and sells a saas application that has hundreds of some of our customers have asked us to support ldap integration for authenticating user accounts against their existing systems instead of having to create another login account for each of their seems like this is referred to as single sign on in many naturally our system already has a mechanism for maintaining user account profiles and authenticating those user accounts from our login a bit ignorant about ldap and are confused about a few please excuse the possible use of wrong terminology a little ignorant about think we understand the basics of how this might customer configures their account to the feature for their they provide the remote url that will authenticate their come to our login page and attempt a login using their username and password provided by their ldap login page will securely forward the login credentials encrypted and hashed in some agreed upon to the url provided by our script will authenticate the user and then redirect them back to our site with the page will analyze the and either accept the user as logged in or the above information is even still need each user to have an account in our we need some way to synchronize our user account profiles with the user profiles in the ldap is this simply an that references the id in the ldap would it then be required that the script must provide that id to our system so we know which user account in our system to associate the login are we our platform is and sql server to build ldap integration for my web

 compared to mysql is as any other pair of dbmss what they have in common is specifically the consequences of each being open in terms of and strengths they are no closer to each other than postgresql is to oracle or db2 is to on to your real you are a albeit one who has not yet had experience with this is a completely realistic task for and a good one since expand your understanding of the varieties of dbmss and gain a perspective on mysql that you get from working solely within its someone who was once in exactly the same my guess is that quickly pick up postgresql and might even hesitate to return to mysql	
 compiler is completely within its rights to optimize and into the same it has been many years since compilers generated code for one stack operation at a these days the whole stack frame is laid out at one few years back a colleague and i figured out a clever way to do naive stack layout probably puts each variable in its own even as in your their lifetimes you might get different results with or	
 compiler might consider that the object is useless besides its use in function and hence inlines the whole that the linker would never see that either class even existed just an linking between testa and class would be done inside there would be a conflict if linker was looking for class foo but the linker simply does not look for it you have linking errors if compiling in debug mode with no optimizations enabled	
 compiler will take any member intialization that you do inline and move it into the constructor for in other words object o new compiled to object public new am not sure how compilers for other languages handle this but as far as is concerned it is a matter of style and you are free to do whichever you note that static fields are handled this article for more information on	
 compilers courses usually focus on how the code is analyzed and translated into machine very but not more important to understand what is this machine code that is generated by the compiler so that you understand how a computer works and what is the cost of each language rather say that you should know an assembly language mean a limited subset of assembly language for one to understand how a computer works and the latter is definitely required for a competent programmer so that he understands what segmenation fault when to optimize and when not and other similar

 condone using a language in a manner that suited for being able to write code in a given language the same thing as being able to write code in the style of that your style match the language then a good indicator that you are making things much more difficult than need there is a certain amount of validity to maintaining ways when dealing with a mature application which is built in a backwards consistency provides maintainability and if a team works on a project and everybody injects their own style or approach then the project becomes a maintenance have to carefully balance the cost of adding a new coding style to an existing however if you are starting a new project then you have a clean slate to implement enforcing coding standards is a good but you have to be able to get a mediator to on the requirement before you can demand it of your

 constructor is a function too why an object implies that all the integrity checks have been perfectly reasonable to check parameters in a constructor and throw an exception once an illegal value has been all this simplifies when your program throws exception in a constructor you can observe a stack trace and often immediately see the if you delay the check then have to do more investigation to detect what earlier event causes the current	
 constructor is declared as which means that it be used for implicit type implicit conversion to could easily lead to undesirable situations since the is taking ownership of the if would allow implicit conversion from a pointer and you accidentally passed a pointer to a method taking an the pointer would be silently converted to an and subsequently deleted when the function even if that the but by marking the constructor as explicit conversion can no longer happen silently and by calling the constructor you clearly express the intention of passing ownership to the thus avoiding any potential assume implicit conversion is do stuff with new normally this

 controls are a form of custom that gives you a visual they are ideal for use when you want a reusable control within the same web is possible to create and package user controls as seperate assemblies but that is beyond the scope of this question and i know has been asked on custom control is typically used to refer to a web or a composite control which is specialized form of a web these controls have no designer and are usually implemented in seperate projects from your web allowing them to be reused accross many your second ascx and aspx are two different ascx is the extension for a user where as aspx is an you cannot use an ascx by itself it must be placed onto an aspx or master way i like to use user controls is i have for example a very complex page which have 7 5 of those have of those grids three of them are well what i can do is create a seperate user control for the content of the this now reduces the code i need down significantly three grids are identicle except for the more it allows multiple to work on various parts of the and it helps me keep everything straight since i am reducing the complexity of the you do not use user controls instead of you use them in conjuction with a do not use ascx over you use ascx to for example on my site every page has the same but i want every page to derive from a single master i can create my footer as an acsx control and put it in each of my master i have a form that lets a user enter three different date we have other so i put the logic to enable a calender and a text box that when clicked on opens up the in a user i can then reuse that user control in all my aspx

 copy of my answer at is the best and safest way to store user email addresses in the just for the sake of the general i agree with others saying not worth the i disagree that anyone who can access your database can probably also get your certainly not true for sql and may not be true for backup copies that are somehow lost or forgotten and i feel an email address is a personal so i care about spam but about the personal consequences when the addresses are when afraid of sql injection then you should make sure such injection is and backup copies should be encrypted for some online communities the members might definitely not want others to know that they are a member related to mental financial medical and sexual adult in those storing as few personal details as possible and encrypting those that are required that encryption does not prevent the details from showing using sql might not be such a bad treat an email address as such personal many sites the above is probably not the and you should focus on prohibiting through sql and making sure visitors cannot somehow get to someone personal profile or order information by changing the

 craig a no two ways about if going to develop iphone going to do it on a the whole toolchain is you do it in visual studio or eclipse or anything else that runs on think that this is some evil plan by apple to make you use a no more nefarious than microsoft requiring mac developers to purchase visual studio in order to develop windows versions of our a mac can be an expensive if just getting started and on a shoestring some advice on doing it on the a used a lot of perfectly good hardware can be found on new models of the mac book pro were recently so many people are selling hardware after they this older hardware is perfectly fine for doing iphone the apps going to develop are small and compact and need a lot of processor power to build and a mac even though buying new save money because supplying your own keyboard and other if like you have plenty of this stuff lying having a hard time justifying the hardware remember that you can run windows or any other x86 based os on this only thing to keep in mind as buying make sure that the mac has an intel the development tools run on the older powerpc others have a powerful machine is of little benefit for iphone compiling is fast enough on the slowest mini and not going to be writing huge programs for such constrained to the simulator does not do processor emulation so it will always be way faster on whatever intel mac hardware than a real live so buy a more expensive mac only if you have some other use for it that would justify the as of if you are buying hardware make sure you buy that supports mountain as the ios development tools generally require the latest mac os x or at best its

 create a data class for each kind of data i i do not use and except within those data my data classes have meaningful and are used in contexts where the particular constraints are if you have a field that is only meaningful with values between 1 and then you have storing it in an whose range is to if you do have fun trying to validate it redundantly everywhere you pass and have fun figuring out when and where you need to validate and have fun when you forget a spot and let invalid data sneak into your and have fun trying to explain to me how a bug not the fault is possible in software written for deterministic digital to you are accepting a score from a text field in a perform on it at the point of giving error messages appropriate for that particular user the preliminary validation can be complex as you need it to to provide meaningful feedback to the performed the initial stuff the data in an appropriate meaningful data class like where the constructor will perform the this authoritative validation should be as simple and efficient as but absolutely sufficient for guaranteeing the value is a boolean the data is either valid or an exception is thrown appropriate for a programmer to if your data validation code for simply a regular expression consider including the data class the regular expression and the data itself in the error all basic data classes should be like the string class once it is guaranteed to be valid and remain preliminary validation code may or may not leverage the data validation it depends on how detailed the data collecting and how much feedback you want to send to the more complex classes you which contain data classes as should not be constructable unless they are so you may need to write code that validates or attempts to construct each individual data catch the construction and handle them by providing more appropriate feedback to the this feedback can involve coloring a field red and displaying an error message next to so as you can there are two kinds of and one is clearly more complex out of

 create the which can be links or images or now hook a javascript function up to each click on the function fires a request to the server code that more or or code takes this will vary wildly depending on what framework you use and a bunch of other connects to the database and runs a query to or the how this happens will vary wildly depending on your database but be something like posts set where id on what the database the server returns a success code or a failure code as the ajax request gets sent to js response function updates the score if a success displays an error if a store the code in a but this is complicated and depends on how well you know the semantics of your runtime it eventually needs to be pushed to persistent storage so using the database is a good initial when the time for optimizing performance there are enough software in the world to cache database queries to make you feel woozy so not that big a

 cursory examination of your code reveal any obvious though you seem to be using a lot of variables with global scope so always possible that got some conflicts that we one potential problem may be that reusing ids since you rely on the same variable to generate the ids for you could test this by having your textboxes named instead of than my recommendations would be to use firebug in firefox and set some breakpoints in the code to see what values are being beyond you might want to think about how you could simplify your code by refactoring to reusable functions for creating a creating a using parameters to provide the attribute since it appears you are using some sort of framework the is idiomatic of several you might also want to see if your framework has a way to handle creating dom elements in a more elegant

 database structure is more since it provides the structural framework on which your code is in general ymmv quite refactoring your db structure after completing a phase of development is significantly harder than simply refactoring code which depends on a stable the reason is refactoring your db structure usually forces code the reverse is rarely your code depends on your database more than your database depends on your this is not the you may need to rethink your address your i think a lot of folks writing blogging about this type of issue tend to come quite strongly from the side of these types of folks tend to consider database design to be and less interesting than coding interesting to someone who likes to solve tends to be the people who blog the coding side is more interesting than the fundamental design and while the fundamental design issues extremely important database design is a very fundamental design

 dealing with a large regex like this you should use the option i think is called in is not so all you need to do is put around the parts you another benefit of the option is that you can comment the regex with comments start with you may also might need to be careful with and they may match more than you expect matches all not just spaces at least in perl and matches all unicode digit not just exp new first je ub yo capture of first second capture of second

 decent compiler will put out the same code and have been as mentioned so optimization questions are think ever seen outside of a bigger conditional where it is clearer to not use but i guess i could see it as a way of emphasizing that the two values really should be identical and something deeply wrong if however a honking big on the next line would be even than these two situations i have to agree with the camp since clearer when you skim the the can be easily especially with some formatting	
 decide where you want to put your programming for better to use some other tree view control use table and javascript framework to handle click i recommend using plain old ashx handler files for ajax they have less overhead than aspx and calling page ajax calls and results must contain only json or xml formatted not the oher rad tool like vs and treeview control offers quick production of web but of course with some you need to go back to server to handle every which draws issues with whole page life cycle processing and huge amount of data transfer for ajax calls along with html are transferred from server to client for every ajax if you want to stick with i css friendly control they greatly reduce size of generated html my from 100kb to 20kb of and replace table layout with wrap treeview inside ajax but just and use conditional updates of be afraid to use several keep viewstate

 decided to look at the problem and see if i could break it into 5x5 solutions with the ending of a solution one jump away from the corner of assumption was that 5x5 is it is and i ran and looked at the i drew a 10x10 numbered grid in excel with a 5x5 numbered grid for then i just searched the results for that would be a jump away from the start of the next for the first i searched for x 10 grid 5 x 5 grid 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 5 6 7 8 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 10 11 12 13 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 15 16 17 18 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 20 21 22 23 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 is a possible puts it a diagonal jump up to 5 the first corner of the next 5 x puts it with last square of 25 in the which is two jumps away from puts it with last square of 97 in the which is two jumps away from square can be any valid because end point the mapping of the solution from 5x5 to 10x10 is as the square is starting on the opposite instead of ran and picked one at should be possible to all do now that 5x5 solutions are know to be valid with endpoints legal moves to the next 5x5 number of 5x5 solutions was which means storing the solutions for further calculation and remapping is pretty i did this this gives you one possible solution above 5x5 solutions as one through four if i return 5 col5 50 row5 if i return 5 5 col5 50 row5 if i return 10 5 col5 50 row5 if i return 15 5 col5 50 row5 if i return 20 5 col5 50 row5 for i in for i in for i in for i in some one double check the i think this is a valid solution and method of breaking up the	
 deciding what dimensions to make a i usually consult major high traffic sites like usually decent indicators of what an acceptable layout dimension right google news has a layout which autosizes to but has a minimum width of has a fixed layout of you may want to do your own survey of but the site working on at the moment has an 800px fixed it is a reasonable dimension for displaying the type of content we are and it will not alienate a dimensions should be specified in or relative to the no reason to define the width of your layout according to the height of a just because a bigger font size is used does not mean the screen resolution is automatically unless you are working with fonts where you can define the number of characters on each row of there much point in making your layout dimensions proportional to type text will automatically wrap around the column width i use frameworks like yui or jquery to shorten development these frameworks also largely conceal inconsistencies between different jquery masks inconsistencies in ecma scripting implementations between different yui largely does the same but also provides advanced ui components and css resets that work across most major beyond i no longer worry about supporting browsers like layout seems pretty if you understand how to build layouts and separate presentation from then you should be is the current w3c i think xhtml is supported by any major browsers ie still does not even fully support xhtml so it is best to write css1 is fully supported by most major while css2 is planning to launch a separate version of the site with a format specially tailored to mobile as tvanfosson mobile users will likely be interested in different content from desktop things like and other images will have to be removed or scaled navigation interfaces and website flow will have to be altered as

 definition of has no parameter named you need to pass the type and variable name to the you only passed the if you use the name grid for the that name has nothing to do with your declaration of you could have used any other name as you pass arrays as to easy way to fix this is to pass a pointer to an array to the function and type safe variable created on the stack comes out of scope when the block it is declared in is a block is anything within an opening and closing for example an i said variable and not for example you can allocate memory on the heap and that data will still remain valid even outside of the but the variable that originally pointed to it would still come out of

 designing i often end up resorting to the following which i like as it results in lots of basic pattern code using the library hands an object to the the library then hands the object back to the calling the calling code is forced to cast the as the library hands back a generic code example library defines the following objects and function creatething procedure processthing doeverything calling code then uses the library by overriding the objects and calling as follows x xsum function creatething procedure processthing result xsum xsum as is the the caller is forced to cast to do processor class is also a tthing the library guarantees that it will only pass tthings to the corresponding tthingprocessor that created so it but while the code above is a bit stupid in that it really do it shows why processthing simply be shifted to tthing and be polymorphic the xsum variable needs to be can i restructure the code so the cast is i need to keep the library code separate but be able to accept any the to an due to suggestion so it will at least throw exception instead of crash in the case of mismatched casting when passing objects through library code

 development i mean on a small boat rocking up and down and someone is holding a gun to your i are the tools at your disposal making the problem is typically a cycle of observe the in some environments this is a very quick and painless but in others very we end up using little tricks to help us observe the result and run the code was thinking of this because i just started using ssis tool included with sql server been quite challenging for me to make mainly because no guidance on what all the dialogs mean and also because the errors are very cryptic and most of the time really tell you what the problem think the easiest environment had to work in was vb6 because there you can edit code while the application is running and it will continue running with your new you even have to run it this can save you a lot of in netbeans with java you can do the it steps out of the method and the method with the new sql server 2000 when there is an error in a trigger you get no stack which can make it really tricky to locate where the problem occurred since an insert can have a cascading effect and trigger many in oracle you get a very nice little stack trace with line numbers so resolving the problem is very of the things that i see really help in locating error messages when things go a stack trace when a problem environment where you can then output the value of variables and step to follow the execution graphical debug environment that shows the code as screen that can show the current values of variables so you can print to to turn on debug logging on a production is the worst seen and what can be done to get around these really intend for this to be flame really just looking for ideas to improve systems so that if creating something think about these things and not contribute to also looking for creative ways around these limitations that i can use if i find myself in this is the most challenging development environment ever had to work in and what did you do to get around the

 difference between and that nobody has pointed is really something much more than a more elegant equivalent of is much richer and deeper than because know what code will be applied on the nodes selection in the general case this code will be different nodes of the code that will be be written way after the templates was written and that do not know the original on the other is in no way harmful if one knows exactly how an is trouble is that a lot of newcomers to xslt that have experience in imperative programming take as a substitute of a in their favorite pl and think that it allows them to perform the impossible like incrementing a counter or any other modification of an already defined indispensable use of is to change the current document this is often needed order to be able to use the function on a different from the current source xml for example to efficiently access that resides in its own xml	
 difference between cocoa touch and cocoa is in the area of memory you happen to be learning for the very first time possibly any language for the very first i would start with cocoa reasoning is that the iphone does not support automatic garbage and you may find it easier to learn the certainly less way then as you migrate to os x development appreciate the shortcuts that the os x platform gives you learn cocoa development on leopard you may be frustrated at the seemingly more primitive memory management available in the two are very line is if you want to learn to program for the go ahead and jump to the mac os x development is not a just a very similar	
 difference is that the value of a static readonly field is set at run and can thus be modified by the containing whereas the value of a const field is set to a compile time the static readonly the containing class is allowed to modify it the variable declaration a variable the static constructor if not readonly is typically used if the type of the field is not allowed in a const or when the value is not known at compile readonly fields are also that for reference in both cases and the readonly modifier only prevents you from assigning a new reference to the it specifically does not make immutable the object pointed to by the public static readonly test test new static void test new a static readonly field cannot be assigned to in a static constructor or a variable public string difference is that static can be modified by the containing but const can never be modified and must be initialized to a compile time to expand on the static case a the containing class can only modify in the variable declaration a variable in the static constructor constructors if not keyword in const string abc only at is evaluated at compile time and can not be changed at run attempt to change it will cause a compilation is already kind of classes and structs are initialized at run time with new you set a constant to a class or it has to be one of the integral keyword in readonly string be initialized in declaration code or consturctor is evaluated at run be declared as static or instance level read only field can hold a complex object by using the new keyword at run kumar	
 difference is when you say you are through the you actually looping through the iterating over integers between 1 and and adding to the collection at those this has no effect on the fact that the numbers between 1 and 50 still you enumerate the you are enumerating the not the so when you add items while you invalidate the built that way to prevent cases like what you are where potentially you could enumerate to item 6 in the list at the same time as inserting an item at index where you would enumerate potentially the old or the new or some undefined for a list if you want to do but be prepared to deal with the inaccuracies of at the same time

 difficult to fully answer your question without specifying a programming answer with respect to because for all i know the answer might be is a then a server first binds to a port by calling this creates a socket in server it is prepared to catch data on port one calls this throws the socket into server this means that a request for a connection will be received by this socket to 10 pending requests at a the time we get to the operating system already knows listening on port merely says what going to do with the requests we in will return where connection is a connection through another in this is not very different from the socket object that the client has reasonably symmetric from here on	
 directive in not a using directive to use the types in a namespace without having to specify the a using directive does not give you access to any namespaces that are nested in the namespace you somewhat closer behavior with scope of the elements made available by an imports statement depends on how specific you are when using the imports for if only a namespace is all uniquely named members of that and members of modules within that are available without if both a namespace and the name of an element of that namespace are only the members of that element are available without if you be able to just say

 do have a pretty sticky situation even if you do find a way to get your query to fetch the columns based on which database version you are using you now have to figure out which database you are using everywhere in your bussiness model or ui so that you reference columns which do not would recommend using two subsonic providers and then having the generated class each implement an interface that contains properties for the columns that are common to the two classes as well as the subsonic methods that you plan on using to interact with your database such as when you want to customize something to work how you want it to work you need to write some custom code

 driven architecture is the idea that you create models which express the problem you need to solve in a way that is free of any at least implementation and then you generate implementation for one or more specific the claim is that working at a higher level of abstraction is far more powerful and in your models outlive technologies you still have something when your first language platform becomes obsolete that you can use for your next generation another key claimed benefit is that much of the boilerplate and can be once the computer understands the semantics of your it can help you claim this approach is 10 times more and that it is we will all be building software in 10 this is all just i am wondering what the outcomes are when the rubber meets the the version of mda is from the and seems very it is heavily based on which might be considered good or bad depending on who you ask leaning towards in spite of those it is hard to argue with the idea of working at a higher level of abstraction and the computer to understand the semantics of your problem and imagine a series of er models which simply express and then imagine using those to generate a significant portion of your first in one set of technologies and then again in another set of love to hear from people who really are doing mda right now or what tools are you how is it working how much of the theoretical promise have you been able to do you see a true 10x effectiveness you doing mda driven right if what tools do you and how is it working

 equality comparison of a type overload these would correspond to if such an interface do this for each t you want to compare bool operator t bool operator t comparison code should be done in one the interface method comparing to another type implement as and put the field comparison code for that type in overloaded methods and operators should forward the equality comparison task to the main instance such that an clean dependency hierarchy is maintained and stricter guarantees are introduced at each level to eliminate redundancy and unessential if is this for each you may return to return is null or cannot be compared to this therefore it is not if to object for reference equality or use return performance only if object instance is frequently compared to otherwise just an extra useless return type fields to determine static bool operator t t y if to object for reference equality or use return y to equals on instance if return was y is not return static bool operator t t y if return y to equals on instance if return was y is not return preceding implementation centralizes the field comparison to the end of the implementation for the and operators have a parallel but opposite i prefer this over having one reference the such that there is an extra method call for the dependent if the operator is simply going to call the rather than offer an equally performing then you may as well just use and avoid the extra method is left out from the equals operator and the because it can introduce unnecessary overhead in some inconsistent performance depending on how often an instance is compared to itself vs other alternative i but should is to reverse this centralizing the equality code in the equality operator instead and have the equals methods depend on one could then use the shortcut of to check for reference equality and null equality simultaneously as philip mentioned in an earlier but that idea is it seems like killing two birds with one but your actually creating more work after determining the objects are neither both null nor the same you will in still have to on to check whether each instance is in my you check for any single instance being null exactly by the time the equals instance method is already ruled out that the first object being compared is so all left to do is check whether the other is so after at most two we jump directly into the field no matter which method we use as i if you really are comparing and object to itself the majority of the then you could add that check in the equals method just before diving into the field the point in adding it last is that you can still maintain the hierarchy without introducing a check at every

 everywhere hired contractors to work on the legacy stuff that our employees have forgotten or otherwise want to work nobody is going to hire you in order to teach you things you be around long so they will only hire you for your current quite a few contractors complain about having to keep their skills up to at their own also get less time spent in meetings maybe be there to be told what they expect of but also have to manage your own and invoice the and then chase up think contracting is a magic route to fun coding with the latest its probably the opposite of what you want is a different

 exactly the way you said polygons render faster but have a high cpu namely the triangulation in my experience it pays off to triangulate the polygons if you have to render it at least size of the polygon makes a difference very small polygons cost much less if you use the stencil buffer method than large polygons because you can restrict the size of the second rendering pass to the boundary box of the	
 exactly what you are looking similar be done with code coverage tools they do not do static inspection of the source but instrument the bytecode to gather metrics at of you need to drive the application in a way that exercises all usage and might miss the rarer code the static analysis maybe these tools can help you apache project uses them to check for api compatibility for new seems like that task is somewhat related to what you are trying to is a tool that checks java libraries for binary and source compatibility with older basically you give it two sets of jar files and clirr dumps out a list of changes in the public is a javadoc doclet which generates an html report of all the and fields which have been added or changed in any including their when two apis are

 example shows how to trap the f1 key in wndproc and then show the help from one method idea in that article is to implement an interface exposing id and then show context help based on that the f1 handler then checks if your control implements that and if then it the parent until it finds an implementation of that an even simpler approach you want to add an id to each is to modify the f1 handler to show context help based on a static type dictionary which would contain topic ids for every supported whenever you need to associate a topic with a specified you would update the it would be wiser to add more abstraction to this approach by adding some sort of a provider or to that for you might need additional logic to show topics based on or some other

 far i have been exiting and reentering the interpreter because re importing the file again is not working for just saying again gives you the existing copy of the module from can say to update and get a new copy of that single but if any other modules have a reference to the original module any object from the original they will keep their old references and very confusing things will if got a module which depends on module and you have to followed by if got two modules which depend on each which is extremely common when those modules are part of the same you reload them if you reload get a reference to the old and vice the only way to do it is to unload them both at once by deleting their items from before importing them this is icky and has some practical pitfalls to do with modules entries being none as a if got a module which passes references to its objects to system example it registers a or adds a warnings you reload the system module without confusing the rest of the python for all but the simplest case of one module being loaded by one standalone is very tricky to get as you you are using a you will probably be better off continuing to cycle the

 feature was in they defaulted to nullable references and used to indicate this was because they wanted backward my dream language which probably be the only make the same choice as by would also make it illegal to use the operator on a nullable reference anything else that would dereference how would you use have to convert them to how would you do by testing them for java and the statement can only accept a test extend it to accept the name of a nullable reference in this myobj is so can be special syntax would be unsurprising to prefer a special syntax like this to make it clear that we are doing a check that modifies the type of the name within the add a further bit of into anotherobj is so can be just gives the name to the result of the expression on the left of the so it can be used in the scope where it is do the same kind of thing for the message into m m message that is but so are the two possible results of the test so the assignment is then maybe a bit of sugar for the presumably common case of substituting a value for message or message would only be validly applied to a nullable type on the left and a on the right also have a notion of ownership for instance the compiler would generate the method and the syntax would be used to augment exactly as in had another syntactic extension related to due to the problem of ensuring that had been initialized correctly during private public other you have to initialize fields in the same way as call other constructors with or unless of course you initialize them directly next to the field

 figured out what caused the problem but i still know why it happened when i started using and it must have something to do with how the linker decides to bring in and execute static libraries and my code under test is a static it refers to another static which at some point i know not decides to load in its is in the same directory as everything so i know why it find as far as i the code under test absolutely does not call the fmod initialization but maybe fmod has some static global initializers that initialize themselves and load in the and that code only gets pulled in if code in a module that uses it testing unmanaged code using the visual studio test framework and when i started using fmod it stopped every even tests that do would report for to get type the specified module could not be from a lot of trial and excluding files and i discovered that only one of the test files elicits the and it only does if this line is the tests start failing with that message if that line is in the is a function that does very instg new static does nothing beyond the default static void static return is a pretty vanilla class with no just various for its matter how i run the tests test run run run from the command from the test i get the to step into the test with the debugger fails the test fails before the debugger gets to step setting the debugger to break on system exceptions did nothing as code under test is a static clr support is and this just if i call a static entity member same if i move said static function outside of the same if i move that function to another i set the debugger to break on any i do get something exception at 0x7c812aeb in microsoft hrexception at memory location no source code at that of the call below may be incorrect no symbols loaded for the stack trace that mstest reports i get anything useful out of to get type the specified module could not be from at string evidence assembly boolean boolean at string evidence assembly boolean boolean at evidence boolean at evidence assemblyhashalgorithm boolean at at string at is fmod doing implementing fmod visual test strange behavior all tests fail unable to get if certain line of code in one

 find it helpful to launch the offline msdn library separately rather than have it appear within visual this makes it easier to browse at a decent size without interfering with your actual coding window and often look up documentation without having visual studio open at usually use the index pane on the left then if i need to know about in a particular namespace or i can just start typing the of that only works if you know which namespace to look so i would thoroughly recommend taking half an hour to just browse the most important namespaces to get a feeling for in have an idea of web windows need to really learn anything there by rote just try to get the gist of so you know where to look also find that when searching the including helps a of course plenty of great content but nice to be able to filter it

 finding all descendents of a row with mptt is finding all children can be however you should be able to fix that by adding a field to your table that records the parent of the then the search contains redundant potentially denormalizing your table but since any already requires global keeping much extra to you could alternatively use a field that records the vertical level of the although that is in fact likely to change under certain types of transformations moving a subtree to a different point in the plain old representation just having and no or is of course faster for but the only queries it can answer efficiently are the parent of and the children of most workloads involve much more reading than so usually mptt is faster overall but perhaps in your case you need to consider moving to

 fine folks over at have gnu make for as a native it works but does have a few minor quirks due to a hack that tries to equate a target named with the file the gnuwin32 package does include a nice pdf of the use it on xp alongside gcc from the as well as with several different embedded systems cross compiler mingw also provides a native build of gnu do use cygwin for a couple of in particular one where the vendor provided a working toolchain and build environment hosted in moving it to a native windows shaped build would be prohibitively and would make it harder to accept updates from the you want to use mostly native windows but need to start by running configure on an existing source then take a look at this started as a fork of cygwin by the mingw and it intends to provide a minimal set of tools with a bash shell so that configure can be used on it as complete as but it is a lot lighter will find that the manual for gnu make is mostly you have to keep in mind that the content of a makefile is not written in a single the stuff that defines variables and lays out the dependancy tree is one each line of an action is a miniature shell script that is in the language of the default shell might be rather than on and each command has options and you are comfortable with your build then cygwin might be the path of least but msys is often and there is something to be said for adopting the native tools of the target platform so that you have a sense of how your users see in which case mingw and gnuwin32 are handy resources to know

 first not all callers have to use the same repository this is especially true of an external is interface this means that you need to some logic it is possible to use to inject wcf rather than a dal using the same by using assembly it sounds like this is what you are this works in many but not fundamentally based apis often need to be designed differently in order to be it also pure from an soa but it gets the job and allows more intelligent domain so in an intranet scenario it is perfectly external caller would just use the apis than assembly but anything is

 frequent uploads of small the fastest way would be to implement your own proprietary but that would require a considerable amount of work and also it would be meaning future integration would be difficult unless you are able to implement your protocol in any client if you choose to do it this is my suggestion for a simple 1 byte to identify be for upload 0x02 for download 0x11 for upload 0x12 for download can be or prefixed with a byte for the length the name is less than 255 md5 for instance upload request or download size upload request or download upload request or download could be implemented on top of a simple tcp you can also use avoiding the cost of establishing a connection but in this case you have to deal with retransmission deciding to implement your own take a look at http libraries like you could make your server use standard http commands like get for download and post for this would save a lot of work and be able to test the download with any web suggestion to improve performance is to use as the file repository not the but something like you can create a single table containing one char column for the file name and one blob column for the file since sqlite is lightweight and does an efficient most of the time avoid the disk access assuming you need client although is your preference to give you raw native code rarely this is the major bottleneck in this kind of most probably will be disk access and network mentioning this because in java probably be able to make a servlet to do exactly the same thing http get for download and post for with less than 100 lines of use derby instead of sqlite in this put that servlet in any container and

 general rule of thumb here is that server roundtrips are expensive to how long a typical query so the guiding principle is that you want to minimize basically each join will potentially multiply your result set so the way i approach this is to keep joining until the result set gets too large or the query execution time gets too long seconds on your platform you may or may not be able to execute queries in this is a key determinant in what you should do because if you can only execute one query at a time the barrier to breaking up a query is that much worth keeping certain relatively constant data in memory for or doing them as a separately query but this in my reasonably more common is having to fix up systems with awful performance due in large part to doing separate queries correlated instead of

 generally use an output parameter and define the possible integer an insert new row id integer known possible error missing zero missing zero becomes a bit tedious to define but it can be extensible and it is a way to get meaningful results back to your clients and for a data access layer to pass back to a business objects layer an exact reason for failure use enums in the business objects layer for different status is also possible for a data access layer to throw exceptions if desired but i believe from a performance perspective you are better off not throwing errors when you could just check an enum or integer are other techniques this is just one that i have used with some measure of success in the

 generated using and used the function and a local function to color which is working have results from a statistical test that indicate if a set of nodes the cluster of and in the corner of the are significant or also have a local function that i can use with that finds the exact node in my dendrogram which contains significant would like to either the the edges that join and a around and have the following local function details of the condition but that it highlights significant function if a leaflist for in clusterlist if i now have a node that contains significant like to use a call to another local which colors the edges that run down to the a around the within this i have tried calling but this did not function a my ideal the edges connecting and would be dashed and of a red have also tried using within this h x border the result does not work with horizontal dendrograms dendrograms with horizontal is an the red stripe in the something is not correct about the dimensions of what and i know how it to be able to write my own appreciate any advice for getting or to work or to be able to write my own asking this i used to get the functional code that calculates parameters and draws the i wrote a custom version of this function to handle horizontal and vertical and call it with there is some kind of clipping effect that removes part of the for horizontal leaves that are drawn on the right side of the the rightmost edge of the either disappears or is thinner than the border width of the other three sides of the for vertical leaves that are drawn on the bottom of the the bottommost edge of the suffers the same display i had done as a means of marking significant clusters is to reduce the width of the such that i render a vertical red stripe between the tips of the cluster edges and the leaf eliminates the clipping but introduces another in that the space between the cluster edge tips and the leaf labels is only six or so pixels which i have much control this limits the width of the vertical worse problem is that the that marks where the vertical stripe can fit between the two elements will change based on the width of the larger tree which in turn depends on how the tree hierarchy ends up being wrote a better a hack to adjust this value and the width for horizontal it always work but for the trees i am it seems to keep from getting too close to edges and a better fix would be to find out how to draw the so that there is no or a consistent way to calculate the specific position in between tree edges and labels for any given so as to center and size the stripe would also be very interested in a method for annotating edges with colors or line do i color edges or draw rects correctly in an r

 good situation that sparse branching is suitable for is when you have a complicated product potentially made up of lots of say the build takes a long time for the whole and perhaps the sync takes a while too lots of data but your development only needs to modify a small subset of the whole source base maybe a module or with possibly some linkage code this doing a sparse branch can make a lot of it means you have already synced to the bulk of the and probably already built but you do have to be careful that any files you modify are branched first otherwise you risk breaking the certainly it requires more care by the case where sparse branching may be the only practical way of doing branched development is if it is hard to have more than one version of your app on a development in this case it would be tricky to have both a mainline build and a development build building and running side by obviously not but some products are like that either by necessity or

 great for interfaces you can add behaviour which only uses existing methods on the linq to objects is the prime example of also useful for creating fluent interfaces without impacting on the types that are being my favourite example is probably inappropriate for production but handy for unit birthday anywhere that you want to or add behaviour to the type but you want to make it easier to the extension methods are worth if you find yourself writing a bunch of static methods to do with a particular think about whether extension methods make the calls to those methods look

 guessing its while hashset implements isreadonly has no meaning for in if you reflect the property always returns implementing it explicitly hides this method from the public reason is because the icollection interface may be implemented because of incidental reasons to support xaml rather than because its necessary to the primary use of the so implementing it explicitly can keep the clutter out of the

 guideline we use prefer const over you tend to use const you get used to using only constant operations on the objects you get and that is as much as using as much as has a once you get to use it propagates to all your your methods become and that requires using only constant operations on the and passing constant references that itself forces only constant the performance advantage of using constant iterators over non constant iterators any at is much less important than the improvement in the code operations meant to be

 hacky little algorithm that works great for large numbers uses the relation how to do it in base 10 you can trivially convert to any other logarithm the number of decimal digits in the the integral part of your is since 123456 has 6 can stop here if all you need is the integer part of the just subtract 1 from the result of step get the fractional part of the divide the number by of then compute the log of that using use a simple series approximation if nothing else is and add it to the integer to get the fractional part of compute and add it to the result of step which is note that basically just tacking on a decimal point to the front of the large there is probably a nice way to optimize this in your use and for really big numbers you even need to bother with grabbing all of the digits is a great approximation to

 had a similar requirement on 1 of the projects where you had to send huge number of emails each and the client wanted complete control over html templates for different types of to the large number of emails to be performance was a primary we came up with was static content in sql server where you save entire html template mark up with place like which are replaced with real data at run for different types of we loaded this data in cache so we dont read the html templates over and over again but only when they are actually gave the client a wysiwyg editor to modify these templates via a admin web whenever updates were we reset then we had a seperate table for email logs where every email to be sent was this table had fields called emailsent and simply ran a job every 5 minutes for important email types new member sign forgot which need to be sent ran another job every 15 minutes for less important email types promotion news way you dont block your server sending non stop emails and you process mails in once an email is sent you set the emailsent field to

 had an issue similar to this where a code bug was silent in msvc2k5 but if you had the msvc2k5 sp2 runtime installed it caused an error which point at valid of the problem when you start executing data as code you could be doing anything and so the crash location becomes useless as you cannot even get back to a valid stack had this happen to us when the new runtime install installed a newer version of the msvc runtime in the sxs the end our method to resolve the issue was to make the crash happen frequently and add as much logging as necessary to localize

 had the same issue and it was absolutely what the docs say on the mysql website the driver try to stale dead enabled the driver will throw an exception for a queries issued on a stale or dead which belong to the current but will attempt reconnect before the next query issued on the connection in a new the use of this feature is not because it has side effects related to session state and data consistency when applications do not handle sqlexceptions and is only designed to be used when you are unable to configure your application to handle sqlexceptions resulting from dead and stale connections investigate setting the mysql server variable to some high value rather than the default of 8 my it seem like the on the next functionality worked but i was using mysql which may have been the reason for ended up writing a that catches the checks for that specific and attempts to reconnect and retry the query if provides a bit more and indicates that autoreconnect will probably be removed in the future

 have a database that i wish to build an ef model however i do not want to include certain columns from the database as the columns concerned are maintained exclusively on the server and should not be manipulated by any of the columns are datetime this makes any one of the columns is nullable and is maintained by a trigger on updates and the other is not nullable and set using a default value in the table guess i am looking for something like the option in but i cannot find such an anybody tell me how to work around have been trying to introduce business object modelling at my place of work for some years and it has always been rejected because of the amount of additional code that has to be ef is currently being seen as a viable solution because of the designer and code generation therefore any option that involves the xml will only turn the rest of my colleagues away from i am therefore looking for something that can be done either using the designer or using guess that what i am looking for here is a way to create the model without ef referencing the columns in the store and therefore not looking to manipulate it in any a way to programatically set the attribute against the property when i create the objectcontext easy answer is to manually manipulate this in the but this would then be overwritten if i refreshed the model from the database and i cannot go down the route where the are ignore

 have two questions regarding a how to escape potential apostrophes or any other characters that would cause an not worried about sql how to use in with and include results that have a i seem to find any advice for the first option since every one says use parametrized that a queries which pretty sure you do with the the situation is like i know what the values are going to be ahead of time since the list is retrieved from a i know i could parse the string before passing it to the select but sure there is some ansi built in away of doing it which afraid i aware that two apostrophes in a row would escape the character if i knew where it was going to be located but i know the exact location when i receive now for the actual select what looking to do is allow the user to free form type into a text this text field will use 4 different columns to filter so the user could type in several items separated by space which would then perform a query per their the itunes search box which allows you to type free form album song etc or you could be specific and only search by one type of know how to do an in or a like by themselves but not sure how i could put them together escaping the apostrophes and including results that match but might have a null in one of the and of course do something that is supported by the in like the user in the case above provided lu which should return a record for the more information they provide would further refine the any is the technical specs regarding my expression using in and

 have used parts of poco now and again and found it to be a very nice i largely abandoned ace a number of years ago but poco contains some of the same patterns i have never had any problems with it so i have to assume it is aspects that i is a pretty well integrated oop hierarchy so the components work well with each it has a much more cohesive feel than something like boost which is rather source code is available and very you need to devote large blocks of time to understand what it is doing at least last i looked at the or be a template wizard stick close to standard exceptions are derived from they reinvent is surprising there is a lot more there than appears at first matter of personal preference but the authors stick pretty much to a one class per header file model so you end up including a lot of different mostly doxygen type api pages and a couple of pdfs pointing to source usable but considering the size of the lib it is initially difficult to figure if you are making the best use of the there is an active community built around i never found the package is maintained by some european based company and they had a wiki but i find it that active or things the downside is pretty i think it is a very good library and would definitely recommend

 have worked for quite some time on a project that does essentially what you are looking to we split it by folder is the only so and the pages share a common for it works pretty with a few sure the files are always updated together this is necessary because of the shared code if you update the code all the referenced controls had better exist on the careful about your control references run into some issues where controls were referenced from the wrong resulting in some interesting sometimes hard to i would recommend splitting it into folders instead of using the file naming structure because it also very easily allows you to provide locale specific images and css also it allows you to override the common behavior of a page by just adding the appropriate code behind could do this but then your class names will be strange due to the periods in the file as opposed to

 hit the nail on the head you want your as modeled using a state to be decoupled from your domain your domain entities probably have direct knowledge that they are being used in a state which will manage the job of transitioning them from state to state based upon certain but they understanding the business meaning of each state they are and be able to enforce or apply business rules related to those your domain entities that are appropriate for being managed by a state machine will have some kind of status that acts as a state for the state and will raise events which can be used by the state machine to determine when a transition is if it is indeed true that your states are sequential they always go or backwards and forwards exactly one not sure a state machine does make sense because there is no special context needed to choose the next state you can only go backwards or so any ordered list of states as an coupled with logic should suffice but real world processes are rarely that strictly even though they may appear to be at first	
 honestly surprised at those a computationally intensive product i would place a large wager on c to perform you might write code that leaks memory like a and has interesting threading related but it should be only reason i could think that java or would be faster is due to a short run length on the if little or no gc avoid the overhead of actually deallocating if the process is iterative or try sticking a wherever you think done a bunch of setting things to null or otherwise removing if dealing with terabytes of my opinion is going to be much better off with deterministic memory allocation that you get with if you deallocate roughly close to when you allocate your heap will stay largely with a gc environment you may very well end up with your program using far more memory after a decent run length than you would just because of me this sounds like the sort of project where c would be the appropriate but would require a bit of extra attention to memory my bet is that or java will fail if run on a full data

 i believe the misinformation strings being immutable have nothing with if someone already has access to the objects in a running application would have to be assumed if you are trying to guard against someone a string in your they would certainly be a plenty of other opportunities available for a quite novel idea that the immutability of string is addressing threading hmmm i have an object that is being changed by two different how do i resolve synchronize access to the naawww not let anyone change the object at all fix all of our messy concurrency in make all objects and then we can removed the synchonized contruct from the java real reason out by others is memory it is quite common in any application for the same string literal to be used it is so in that decades many compilers made the optimization of storing only a single instance of a string the drawback of this optimization is that runtime code that modifies a string literal introduces a problem because it is modifying the instance for all other code that shares for it would be not good for a function somewhere in an application to change the string literal to a would result in being written to for that there needed to be a way of guarding against code that attempts to change string literals make them some compilers support from the would accomplish this by placing string literal into a special readonly memory segment that would cause a memory fault if a write attempt was java this is known as the java compiler here is just following an standard memory optimization done by compilers for and to address the same issue of these string literals being modified at java simply makes the string class immutable gives you no setters that would allow you to change the string strings would not have to be immutable if interning of string literals did not

 i call does it call should take any required actions to dispose of the which should be if not identical calling is an implementation detail and not necessarily guaranteed we can expect that the bcl follows this i want to use an object but then use it again in another code should i not call which also means to omit the using you want to use the object you definitely should not dispose you should typically use two separate connections if going to the database two separate generally not a good idea to keep an around an longer than is needed to grab your needed to if a filestream is wrapping a streamwriter and i call dispose on the this will call and on whether calls on the if i call close on the this will only call and on the an object that wraps another disposable object should call on the interior calling on a will call its method under the so it will also act on both checking il a good way to answer these questions about what is happening under the il will definitely answer most of these questions as you can also just try debugging your own dispose there is of msdn documentation to start with before you try to figure it out and reflector if you want to muck around in

 i finally figured out a working the for updating this is mainly because must run within a you can try running it within the existing but that is probably tied to the same persistence context of the entity what this means is that after you update you have to find a way to the the easy way is to call but this results in all sorts of side effects about it in the jpa the better solution is to get the underlying delegate my a hibernate and call this will probably work on simple domain but mine were very i was never able to get to work correctly with my existing jpa like i also tried manually passing my domain graph a and having each parent entity evict its this also work for unknown was left in a situation where only would but i accept the side i then tried creating a separate persistence unit specifically for entity i figured i could localize the operation to only that pc in charge of i set up a new a new corresponding a new transaction manager for and manually injecting this transaction manager into the repository for manual wrapping of the in a transaction corresponding to the proper here i have to say that i know enough about container managed because it ended up being a nightmare trying to get the transaction for to play nicely with the container managed transaction getting pulled in from the service this point i threw out everything and created this class jdbcuserconversionrepository implements userconversionrepository userservice jdbctemplate user user final class update the user set where new before we try to load our converted user back into the we need to remove them from the pc so the try to load the cached one in the keep in mind that of the child entities of this user will remain in the this normally cause a problem when the pc is throwing a entity in this specific we return a new reference which replaces the old this means if we just evict then remove all references to the pc will not be able drill down into the children and try to persist reload the converted user into the persistence return public void datasource new are two important parts of this method which i believe make it marked it with should suspend the container managed transaction coming in from the service layer and allow the conversion to take place external of the trying to reload the converted entity back into the i evict the old copy currently stored in the pc with the code for this is simply getting a instance and calling see the comments in code for more but basically if we do this any calls to will try to return the cached entity still in the except that it will throw an error about the type being my initial tests have gone this solution may still have some i will keep this updated as they are

 i first posted this question i had strong coupling between my web service and application controller where the controller needed to open multiple threads to the service and as it received back data it had to do a lot of processing on the returned data and merge it into one i did not like the fact that the client had to so much processing and merge the returned data before it was ready to be used and wanted to move that layer to the service and let the service open the asynchronous threads to the suppliers and merge the results before returning them to the challenge i had was that i could not wait till all threads were complete and results were i had to start receiving data as it was that called me to implement an observer pattern on the service so that it would notify my application when new set of results are merged and ready to be used and send them to the was looking for how to do this using either on asmx webservices or wcf and so far i have found implementing it using wcf but this thread is always open for suggestions and observer pattern using

 i notice that you go into some detail about the problem but mention the information provided in section 4 of specification for the deflate compressed data the format used in which leads me to believe you might have missed this basic approach is a chained hash table using sequences as as long as the chain is not all the entries along it are scanned to eliminate false eliminate matches that are too and pick the longest match out of those that their recommendation is shaped by the factor of it may be that they knew of a more effective technique but could not be sure that it was not covered by always wondered why one find the longest matches by examining the matches for the sequences that start at the second byte of the incoming the third and weeding out matches that match if your incoming data is and got hash matches for at offsets 302 and 416 but your only hash match for is at offset you know that unless you have two entirely coincidental overlapping hash matches unlikely then 302 is your longest note their recommendation of optional ironically does more instead of automatically taking the longest match that starts at the first byte of the incoming the compressor checks for an even longer match starting at the next if your incoming data is and your only matches in the sliding window are for and for better off encoding the as a literal byte and the as a

 i recall there is a vector table in the beginning of memory space that points to the routine to call when a specific interrupt i may be hitting at too low a level here x86 assembly but at the base level you get your vector installed in that table then your routine is not got any of my old reference material with me so give you the actual calls but be surprised if the official method operated outside of the these days of guis sure there are more appropriate that allow interrupt sharing and all that good ignore much of just seen that you are looking at interrupt 16 and above which are outside of the hardware i moved away from that level of programming before there were any interesting bits of hardware in that space so i only ever dealt with the first 15 irqs 16th being the cascade between leaving it just in case of interest to anyone else

 i see what having essentially duplicate c and functions buys suggest keeping the c functions as basic as defining an api with all the primitives exposed and nothing then define the classes at a much higher so a uart would have a meaningful that sort of it would have all necessary data the classes would not expose all possible in order to do something write a new member function or class or calling the c the approach in systems like occi oracle call and mfc and and it works

 i started my switch from vbscript to javascript i was immediately enthralled with after a short while i started to really understand how javascript and jquery interacted with each other and i became a little confused and my issue was with the desire to use the simplicity of jquery but i felt like i was cheating myself by not learning javascript turned out that i learned both at the same as i wrote jquery routines i found the need to learn javascript in order to understand why things worked the way they did and to help make certain jquery routines work am still learning javascript and jquery but i am much less concerned about becoming a master of javascript as i know my understanding will grow as it needs it definitely helps to have some basic understanding of javascript but i would say you should focus on learning how to accomplish specific tasks and not on learning javascript before

 i strongly recommend that you use getting a syntax check that your parens are balanced as well as your in your you have an the but no you can fix that be just removing the you fix likely get some more errors like not in an aggregate or group because you have several columns that are not in you need to add to your group by or perform some kind of aggregate on is all assuming that there are multiple records with the same threadid not the primary if the then the purpose of the group stumped on the syntax i worked around it with a couple correlated sub i guessed at your table structure so modify as needed and try table threadrating int not userid int not rating int not table thread int not rating int not voters int not trigger on from threadrating i where from threadrating i where inserted on what you then we can check the plan and modify as we might be able to get it to work with the group by to you are updating data that impact ratings in only a few select recommend updating the ratings directly factoring the logic into a trigger is nice but provides lots of problems this can be aided by a your trigger will execute every single time someone touches that things like view last updated will execute this you can add logic to short circuit the trigger in those cases but it gets complicated

 i tend to be in the restful programming is being identified by a persistent uris are the ubiquitous choice of identifier these being manipulated using a common set of http methods are the commonly seen case the venerable becomes and actual representation retrieved for a resource is dependent on the request and not the use http accept headers to control whether you want or even a java object representing the the state in the object and representing the state in the the relationships between resources in the representation of the the links between objects are embedded directly in the representations describe how the representation can be used and under what circumstances it should be in a consistent usage of http last one is probably the most important in terms of consequences and overall effectiveness of most of the restful discussions seem to center on http and its usage from a browser and what i understand that fielding coined the term when he described the architecture and decisions that lead to his thesis is more about the architecture and of resources than it is about you are really interested in what a restful architecture is and why it read a few times and read the not just chapter next look into dns read about the hierarchical organization of dns and how referrals then read and consider how dns caching read the http specifications and in and consider how and why the caching works the way that it it will just the final revelation for me was when i saw the similarity between dns and after understanding why soa and message passing interfaces are scalable starts to think that the most important trick to understanding the architectural importance and performance implications of a restful and architectures is to avoid getting hung up on the technology and implementation concentrate on who owns who is responsible for then think about the and

 i the anonymous checkbox in so as to password protect a by restricting read access to designated windows does the resulting password dialogue which is then presented to all anonymous http represent a security risk in that it offers all and sundry an unlimited number of attempts to guess at any windows account not much joy with this so so attaching a just 50 points i am a man of modest to clarify what does disabling anonymous access in iis offer a password guessing opportunity to the public which did not exist or is it the case that the user credentials dialogue can be simulated by including a username and password in a http request and that the response would indicate whether the combination was correct even though the page was open to anonymous users are incorrect password attempts submitted via http subject to the same lockout policy enforced for internal and if so does this represent a very easy opportunity to deliberately lock out known or if is there anything that can be done to mitigate this unlimited password guessing disabling anonymous access in iis create a security

 i think found what you take a look you must define a webmethod on your server and then you can easily access it using an exellent working example is under the link and here modify it to show how you can pass your page use this class to class public string name public string color this is your in my case partial class public static string return name is on your this is what we want to send to the var dogitem and this is how it should be sent in serialized var dogitemserialized dogitemserialized here you fill textboxes and then your data is sent to the server which understands it as a dog pay attention to arguments because this is the most confusing you should pass them in json which is a little bit so i use here script which helps to convert usual javascript object into string it is available but it is still rather ugly it is important that i pass argument called which value is the serialized because this is exactly what the server expects to get for i change the argument this dogitemserialized the last pay attention to the following you are working with prior to then need to write just instead of only encapsulates all the data under member for some in the above article you can find useful links inside the article and in so you can read more about and so hope this

 i think intellij gets it version for 30 you be any more restrictive than part is if your unregistered version is so crippled as to be how do you expect people to decide to buy they have to try features before they decide they like them and want them but the notion some vendors have that people will buy something on the promise of features they been able to try is is at the most liberal end of the you can basically download a version of their software and just use they treat licensing as a social problem and a lot of merit to that should never nag or otherwise annoy your potential customers possibly expiring the software after a predetermined the most notice you should give is expires in n on say a splash screen or other thing you can and should do is provide a low barrier to entry for your a cheap not academic or personal marketing is also a good by this i mean take offered free to approved open source for the technical aspects of be too concerned about the technical never choose any scheme that annoys your users worse slows down your software some schemes or violates the security of the operating system like the sony rootkit your enforcement is not meant to be if people want to steal your software they the enforcement system is there as a gentle reminder nothing for a social not a technical	
 i think it is a good idea to do it if this resources are actually user even if there is a set of it does not belong to a embedded assemblies you would have to resign them after your private key is exposed and everyone can sign your so not worth to sign it and you have a security risk your resources to an external you can still embed the first time your application you create the external file and copy the embedded resources to the external if the external file you care about the embedded resources	
 i think much about but always on my biggest problem always had with parallel processing is determing what should be easy to a thread to background process a but can the file processing itself be think the questions of what can and should be parallelized are answered with complex architectural decisions layered on top of the already complex architectural decisions of the application in my belief is that this complexity will be solved either by the os or by the programming the traditional thread model of parallelization found in c and its descendants is not the final

 i think this is it works for dram and the pagefile since that is an os managed cache is managed by the cpu os could do a tight timing loop of a memory read and try to see if it completes fast enough to be in the cache or if it had to go out to main memory this would be very error there are coherency that are used between processors to determine when to they need to invalidate each i suppose you could have a custom device that would snoop this protocol that the os would are you trying to if you want to force something into current x86 processors support prefetching memory into the cache in a for instance with visual you could use to fetch a line into the done this so use at your own to determine cache misses for you may be able to use some appendix a gives tuning this be used to determine if an individual address is in the cache or when it is loaded in the but can be used for overall i believe this is what vtune phenomenal profiler for this

 i understand indexing scheme when the same long string is indexed as a field in many this really bulk out the index compared to if it were indexed just i create a single term make it and then add it to many does the full string data get duplicated for each document in the if this is the am i just best off putting the actual storage of the into far as i can the only info that comes back in query results is the documents themselves ordered by to determine which fields satisfied the query for a matched must i do separate queries on the fields for each or lucene stores a dictionary mapping strings to numerical so the memory consumed is only to store the identifier several think you are safe storing the tags and attributes in do not need separate queries once you hold a document you can use to get the relevant field you are concerned about lucene i suggest you read lucene and which covers lots of performance

 i was too late on the answer for this but i was working a little test scenario that seems to have worked very well for i used a but and regular expression to locate all the words for the expression is as here with line breaks for formatting my method was to execute this regex with a library like and then read back the named and it worked on all of the different examples listed in this minus the as i add them but as you can it be hard to do this addresses a lot of for it addresses the following items in the original question and other or and spelling that it does not explicitly address that would be something want to do before you passed the string to this this parser sees this example as 2100 one and also thousand and one hundred fifty but also or and also is not totally as what is this code finds this number as simply rather than store this monster of a regular expression in your i was considering building this regex at using something like the so easy part here is we are only storing the words that in the case of notice that there an entry for because just normal number with th tacked but ones like twelve need different so now we have the code to build our now we just execute it on our number thing i would is to or eat the word not and only leads to other what you are going to want to do is setup a function that passes the named matches for into a function that looks at all the possible magnitude and multiplies your current result by that value of you create a function that looks at the named and returns an int whatever you are based on the value discovered value matches are added to your while magnitutde matches multiply the result by the mag two hundred fifty thousand becomes then then then ending up with for i wrote a vbscript version of this and it worked great with all the examples it support named so i had to work a little harder getting the correct but i got bottom line if a add it your if a magnitude multiply your accumulator by this will provide you with some pretty amazing and all you have to do to adjust for things like is add them to your put in a code marker for and handle i hope this post helps someone out if anyone i can post by vbscript pseudo code that i used to test this not pretty and not production i what is the final language this will be written or something like a scripted greg source will go a long way in helping understand how all of this comes me know if i can be of any other i only know so i help you with the other

 i work primarily on intranet apps this been too much of an issue with i often do apps for other departments and especially when the project is we do sign a memorandum of understanding with regard to the project and since i work in an agile none of those things are which is often hard to explain to other departments that worked this way typically i will include a description of the process itself a couple of paragraphs explaining how the project is a cooperative venture between them and that together we determine when the time the mou is actually already invested a number of hours in the project discovering what the requirements are are handled at a standard hourly based on that coupled with an estimate of my velocity and similarity to previous i give an broad estimate of the amount of time and cost for the required features again that the real cost is determined by which features we actually implement and how long it really this takes a fair amount of but since been working together to develop the requirements i usually have that with the individuals that dealing with i often try to leave the actual estimate out of the but will include it if their i do try to give them a budget experience is that once the project starts and you start delivering value to the they are rarely they ask for pay more than the original project we both agree that some of the original features are not but i always expect after they really have no way of knowing for sure until they actually see things in operation what it is that they really more often than we drop some features and add others based on the actual i suppose if we there be any point to using agile think the key issue is suggest working with a new customer on smaller projects or explicitly breaking a large project into smaller projects to develop once they and you know that you can trust each other to build the right product with the right i think the risk and there always is one of the customer pulling out abruptly is

 i would step in since i write email software for a are two common scenarios for smtp to server and to to public server to server email communication takes place over port if you want your domain to receive email from other then you have to accept smtp traffic at port this is sent as clear there are ways of encoding the specific but as far as the it is sent as ascii text in binary it is not sent over is also some private server to server communication that can take this might take place in large where they might have the internal corporate server that every one when you send an it is sent to the corporate but then this corporate server forwards the email off to a public facing that public facing server sends the email off to a receiving that receiving server is accepting email at port to has more on the server you can configure different submission ports ports you will accept email these can be anything you want them to you just have to remember to tell your users to configure the client software the most common ports are 25 and a lot of isps will block outgoing port 25 that is what spam bots use to send to public mail they have 587 open so you can send email to your smtp the common port for smtp over ssl is this can get a lot more and left out a good bit of but it in a

 idea is that given a specific input to the somehow i want to automatically through the complete program and dump its control flow along with all the data being used like classes and their is their a straightforward way to do or can this be done by some scripting over gdb or does it require modification in the reason for this question is because of an idea regarding a debugging what it does is given two different inputs to a one causing an incorrect output and the other a correct it will tell what part of the control flow differ for what i think will be needed is a complete dump of these 2 control flows going into a diff and if the two inputs are following similar control flows then their diff would many give a good idea about why the bug can be made into a very engaging tool with many features build on top of complete control flow through	
 idea is that you create a unique number for the and when the form is posted you save this unique number in the database in the record that you are before saving you check if that number has already been in that case a form that has been reposted by you are updating a you only have to check if that record has been saved with the same unique but if you are adding a new record you have to check if any other record has that guid is a good number to use as very unlikely that you get a a 31 bit random number that the class can produce is also pretty unlikely to give but the 128 bits of a guid makes it a lot more have to create the guid value in the just use in the code that initialises the you can put the guid in a hidden field in the in the database you only need a field that can store a guid either a guid data type if available or just a text field large enough to hold the text representation of the can use the method to get the string representation of a guid value that you can put it in the using gives the most compact 32 hexadecimal digits without using gives the more recognisable format to get the guid back from a string you just use

 ideal rule is that each of your layers should be a black box and none of them should depend on validation of another the reason behind this is that the db has no idea of the ui and vice so when the db throws an the ui must have db knowledge to convert that into something the ui layer can so it can eventually convert it into something the can making validation on every layer is also my either put the validation in a single place the business and make the other layers really they check anything write your validation in an abstract way into the model and then generate all validation from for namedesc new new new you can write code which examines the description stuff code or even at and do the validation in each layer with little cost because one change fixes all for you only have these some some error you should be able to get away with these exception classes which have value plus special info like the limit that was so wondering where your many exception classes come your other this is uh by the phase commit i say because there are situations when the protocol breaks down and in my much better to give the user a dialog or some other means to fix the problem rather than investing a lot of time into

 if you want to simplify i would look at using an orm to do the look at entity framework or one of the other billion or so out it will remove a lot of noise from suggestion would be to continue the refactoring you were i like how you absrtacted if you look at your a person have a previous what your doing is leaking a requirement to track previous within your domain i would move all of that and define a which would have two class public person public person think this cleans up a lot of the i also like to handle the multiple phone numbers using a dictionary essentially we class phonetype string string string people might make phone have so i want to debate or you could just have a single string like you one thing to keep in mind is internaitonalization if this on my person i would have a this allows you then to break your four inserts into a single loop as you loop over the phone i would use a simillar model if you have a billing or ship to you go with an one way to help adhere to dry with your sql params is the following code is not meant to be compiled but just to show you a pattern to again minimize class public void using public void using add the id since we have it in updates but not in private void sqlcommand all the code to add params which exists in both insert and what done is consolidated so when you add a new property to a person you only have to modify one function when dealing with more thing to insert your current and previous you are not being you could do void int addresstype from your insert person routine you would call this method course if you take my earlier suggestions this might look very totally missed this but i wanted to highlight what chris said i you but felt it was such a good thing i had to repeat use

 if your build file is large and complex then this is a clear indication that the way you have your code layed in terms of folders and it complex and too i find that a complex ant script is a clear smell of a poorly laid out code fix think about how your code is laid how many projects do you do those projects know how to build themselves with a master build script that knows how to bundle the individual together into a larger you are refactoring you are looking at ways or breaking things down so that they are easier to smaller methods and classes that do one you need to apply these same principles to your code base as smaller components that are functionally cohesive and are very loosely decoupled from the rest of the use a build script to build that component into a do this with the rest of your now create a master build script that knows how to bundle up all of your libraries and build them into your if you have several then create build script for each app and a master one that knows how to bundle the apps into should be able to see and understand the layout and structure of your code base just by looking at your build if is not clean and understandable then neither is your source

 implementing a custom controller in mvc and want to be able to use a colon in the so that i can identify names and their like apparently or iis allow colons in i did some digging and apparently considered a security using mvc and am handling url paths manually treating them as and not relating them to the file so pretty sure this also heard some talk about implementing a custom http handler or thoughts or ideas would be much why break that you investigate building a web wcf is a nice technology for and it hosts well in happen to like and wcf is way too complicated for my i want it to be like but capable of more than just navigating or doing well the problem i have with is that it is interpreting hierarchy where there is in my system is a not a means the instance of the user class with the value of and that is a single that has the potential of having so for would like to display the name of that if i did this with your it would look like problem is how do you know the class and the it could be interpreted my and that make see what getting to give a slightly more complicated suppose we want to select a child of the user entity out of multiple so a user might have several email to select we might it is in fact not a file more like an xpath maybe similar to jquery based on what little i know of it that more of a query selection than a hardwired file it gets evaluated on the no not building a typical web site or even web service a colon in a url with	
 implementing a event various pieces of code will post events to a central place where they will be distributed to all the main problem with this when an exception happens during event i tell anymore who posted the my question is there an efficient way to figure out who called the constructor and remember that in python the simple way would be to use the traceback module to get a copy of the stack in the constructor and remember i only need this information so wondering if there was a way to cache this or whether i could just remember the topmost stack frame and work my way back in the rare case that i actually need this the invocation of a constructor in	
 implementing any sort of metrics ask what is it you want to measure productivity are you not listening but why is this important humans in metrics will innevitably try to optimize it for their own knowing you should be able to use this optimization in your yourself then if someone optimize the what will they be concentrated on direct your metric in measuring someting that will positively effect the thus instead of measuring bugs per programmer which only gives amunition to management to fire if things go try to measure where and why the bugs not who made bugs per bugs per bugs per code bugs per feaures would be much more productive metrics and will help identify of course you can always tie it to someone as there is always an indirect link to a but before you place a programmer on the forefront of the blame war you better be darn sure is the yourself what kind of environment you want to create what will the reaction of the directors will be when faced with the publication you measure and make them look bad then you are asking for if you peasure product then the focus will not be on making themselves look good but making the product look this in turn will be a much better motivator and will foster positive team your metric any sort of information hiding will cause adverse reaction and thus if you publicize your metrics be carefull on what they if you really isist on measuring people then measure them directors veryone should have the same then hide the knives and place metal detectors on the cause transparency with people ina company only works one from the top looking

 implementing tableview viewforheaderinsection where i return a nib loaded simplified it for the purpose of this header text depending on the return this is very slow because i sometimes have headers which all get loaded from nib all at once when the table draws even though those headers are not in there any realistic way of me being able to clone uiviews and thus clone the header in this or is the only way for me to just create the headers uiview hard can i use nib loaded uiview in tableview viewforheaderinsection without having a performance	
 implementing tagging on a particular using nhibernate on sql server the structure i have now like class entity public guid id class tag public guid id public string name class tagassoc public tag linkedtag public entity linkedentity an entity can be tagged multiple times with the same since the association also includes data about the user that tagged the entity and other trying to fetch a list of tags of a particular with the counts of how many times the tag has been something like this in tagassoc as tass left outer join as by generates the following sql as as as as bandtags left outer join tags on by looks but work in sql server because the name property of tag is not included in a to make it i have to manually adjust the group by clause in order to include all properties of the tag tagassoc as tass left outer join as by this depends on the properties of the tag class and therefore would have to be updated every time the class is there some other way to make the first hql query perhaps some hql syntax that automatically makes the properties tags and tag count using hql on sql server

 important difference between and is not will only accept a string but will accept if the operand is an it will be converted to a string by calling on a primitive will be converted as if by calling the appropriate method in the associated wrapper and a null reference becomes the string i know why even people see it listed in the api docs and assume there for a good being the most obvious but a red if performance is really a you should be using a as discussed in the thread john linked or is much more as for the issue of objects in the string i think misunderstanding what the string pool at the actual character and will be stored in a dedicated data and wherever you see the literals and in the source the bytecode will really contain references to the appropriate entries in that data the string pool is populated when the classes are not when the code containing the string literals is that means each of your snippets only creates one the result of the also some object creation behind the which is a little different for each of the but the performance impact is not worth worrying	
 important distinction between valuetypes and reference types is that value types have these a int32 and all other value types have no an int32 is essentially indistinguishable from any other int32 with the same value type exist either on stack or as a part of a reference type one special case is when you cast a value type instance to an object or an interface this is called and it simply creates a dummy object which only contains the value that can be extracted back on the other have an a does not equal any other because they are separate instances on the gc some reference types provide equals method and overloaded operators so that they behave more a string equals other string even if they are in fact two different when you have a it can either contain the address of a valid or it can be when value type objects are they are simply an integer a float boolean or if you need to distinguish between and you need to use either a separate boolean better use the class in which is simply the value plus a boolean also support in the clr so that boxing of a nullable with results in a null not in a boxed structure with as it would if you were to implement this structure

 in addition to my previous answer i suggest reading about the the pdf would recommend mvp pattern instead of you really need any special frameworks for just how you organize your approach i usually is to split each windows form into three class this is what you actually start with when developing a this is where of your logic should view interface which contains the properties and this interface is that the presenter knows about your the when you finish implementing the presenter and the view unit you can then create the actual form class and make it implement the iview then just a question of adding appropriate controls to the form and wiring them to the code simple just for string username string password event eventhandler void void public new private void we ask some service to verify the bool islogonok if private iview form public presenter new public string get return set public string get return set public void username or public void code for opening another private presenter

 in many i am designing a database that should keep record of previous versions of the rows changed in each standard solution to this problem is to keep a history table for each data whenever a row needs to be updated in the data a copy of the current row gets inserted to the history table and than the row in the data table gets disadvantages of this solution for of 2 tables instead of case the structure of the table needs application needs to know both of the tables instead of of the tables might need to be short to keep a convention of the table name and the history table name for am considering a different solution and would like to know if each we add the column a row gets inserted to the it will get inserted with a row gets a copy of the original row will be duplicated to the same table with the change of and the original row will get updated as needed keeping that in my rows are updated at an average of 10 assume that at least of the actions performed by the application happens only on the recent version of the database is an oracle 10g so to keep the table we can split the table to 2 the and the partitioning a good way of solving the history data keeping this solution limits other partition potential to these rows management in

 in process of migrating an old application to have a problem with the following type of sql as join child on by do i express something like this in i tried to map the children as a collection using and get the number of children from the collection but then hibernate has to load all for each parent results in executing around 1000 db queries instead of with all resulting performance there any way around in	
 in response to it is crucial that the database be optimized in addition to the hibernate when you think about after all the work hibernate in the end it is just querying the if the database perform well or missing poorly set up table it matter how much you tune on the flip side if your database is set up well but hibernate the caching is not set up and you are going back to the database a lot more then you need then performance will suffer as it is always important to tune the system end to but start at the foundation and work curious what you mean about do you mean columns have been added to tables that represented in the hibernate data tables have been i think anything like that would affect performance likely data integrity if you are not all the goal of the object model should not be match the database schema you want to abstract the underlying data complexity joins that is the whole point of using something like for example lets say you have things very and application code should be able to do something having to know that underneath it is a one to many the details in your hibernate code control how the load is done that answer your question then please provide more

 in the middle of reworking our build scripts to be based upon wonderful waf did use scons for ages but its just too hit the following situation and i cannot find a resolution to have a product that depends on a number of previously built egg trying to package the product using as part of the build build the dependencies i want to run pyinstaller to package the product that depends on the eggs i i need pyinstaller to be able to load those egg files as part of packaging sounds you work out what should construct a copy of setting the variable up and then invoke the pyinstaller script using passing the previously configured environment as the env problem is that setting alone does not seem to be enough if the eggs you are adding are extension modules that are packaged as in this it turns out that the embedded libraries are not able to be i unzip the eggs the directories to i can import them with no further settings but this is not what i want in this can also get the eggs to import from a subshell by doing the to the directory that contains the egg you want to import the path of the egg a python shell and using to locate the this has been the egg loads as this is not practical because i need to be able to run my python shell in a manner where it is ready to import these eggs from the dirty option would be to output a wrapper script that took the above actions before calling the real target script but this seems like the wrong thing to there must be a better way to do can i make a python extension module packaged as an egg loadable without installing

 is a classic example of trying to use a sledge hammer when a hammer is you want to extract some crazy reporting data out of a table but to do so is going to kill your sql what you need to do to track changes is to create a tracking table specifically for this then use a trigger that records a change in value in a product into this so on my products when i change the price it goes into the price tracking you are using this to track stock prices or something similar then again you use the same approach except you do a comparison of the price table and if a change occurs you save so the comparison only happens with new all the old comparisons are still housed in one location so you need to rerun the querry which is going to kill your sql servers	
 is a cocoa n00b question been programming gui applications for years in other but now i would like to understand what is for the following trivialized have a simple custom that allows the user to draw simple shapes within its implementation is like draw a white nsrect bounds is a nsmutablearray instance whose elements are each wrapping an for in nsrect in addition to drawing the shapes in the we draw the shape based on the current drag can see how simple this code the array instance variable acts as the model that the method uses to draw the new are added to every time the user performs a which also implemented in this custom my this were a cocoa what would be the idiomatic way for my custom view to update its other how should the custom view notify the controller that another shape needs to be added to the list of right the view tracks shapes in its own which is fine as an implementation but i do not want to expose this array as part of my custom public i would want to put and undo code in a centralized place like the controller rather than have it littered all over my custom in my past experience with other gui programming models are managed by an object in my controller and the view generally update them directly the view communicates when something by dispatching an or by calling a method on a controller it has a reference or using some gut feeling is that idiomatic cocoa code would expose a property on my custom and then wire the controller object another object hanging off of the document to the as its in the xib then the view can call some methods like on the but it seems like there are any number of other ways to do such as having the controller pass a reference to a model object list of directly to the custom view or having the view dispatch a notification that the controller would listen to and then the controller updates the should a custom view update a model

 is a pretty standard design and there really a true rule of thumb i typically follow is goes in files go in of the considerations to keep in a file is stored in the how are you going to serve it out via you need to set the content if a file on the the web server takes care of all that stuff for very quickly and efficiently even in kernel no interpreted code are typically big databases are certainly but they are slow and inconvenient to back up why make your database huge when you have like really easy to copy files to multiple say running a you can just periodically rsync the filesystem from your master machine to your slaves and use standard static http obviously databases can be clustered as just not necessarily as the flip side of if already clustering your then having to deal with clustered files in addition is administrative this would be a reason to consider storing files in the data in databases is typically you filter sort by or group by that lessens the value of storing it in the the flip databases understand you can use your standard model of transaction isolation to ensure that two clients try to edit the same file at the same this might be not to say you use but now got two things to understand instead of files in a filesystem can be opened with regular whatever you this can be how are you gonna open that word document out of a blob filesystems have and they can be a pain in the they might be useful to your permissions will really bite you if taking advantage of because almost guaranteed that your web server runs with different permissions than your sarah mei this plays into the http question above on the client side you going to remember to set lifetimes on the server side files on a filesystem are a very and optimized access large blob fields may or may not be optimized well by your and almost guaranteed to have an additional network trip from the database to the web server as people tend to use filesystems for files because they support idioms the no reason you have to do it and filesystems are becoming more and more like databases so it surprise me at all to see a complete convergence

 is a result of lacking parameter you can find yourself in situations these usually the one with the most parameters contains an implementation and the other overloads just call that one with default one thing to note is when number of parameters grows to number of overloads might grow to are so you have to treat them as they an object can only be constructed in ordinary you could call the implementation function as many times as you you have to call the implementation and that is also the thing to constructor chaining syntax points out these get back to the original even though these cases are not very you can overcome this issue by defining a new type using which will be used as the class public string p1 public int p2 public string p3 public double p4 public p1 p2 p3 p4 p2 we provided default parameters at the is this a solution for many will include optional and named parameters so we even need to define a new parameter you might think that feature as a syntactic sugar for however they we will this syntax for constructor

 is kind of hard to give you a good answer as there are lots of unknowns but i will give it show most often heard issue with and wf is that both use the threadpool and are not aware of each this problem depends mostly on your site are wf by default uses only a few threads in the threadpool per proc to execute workflows and another for the the problem is usually solved by using the manual wf scheduler as wf then uses the host ie the one used by now this can be good or bad depending on your first of all the threadpool size has been growing and is now up to 250 threads per proc so threadpool starvation is unlikely to be an issue unless it is a high load a downside of using the manual scheduler is that all ie the become if you need something from the workflow to finish the request but if it is fire and forget your request is now waiting for the workflow to finish or reach some idle so in some cases you will be better off with the default scheduler in you it all depends on what you are doing and the server thing to keep in mind is that iis will recycle the appdomain after a specific i believe 25 hours by or number of when that happens the wf runtime is destroyed with the next request i recreated in another if you are not using persistence all your workflow state will be lost and existing workflows will be depending on the amount of time a workflow takes this could be a problem or may not hard to tell from my

 is no memory leak but you should use instead of especially since your function is you ever want to to use a type which has a your malloc based function is broken since it call any replace with simply doing double new stuff with is functionally equivalent it can call constructors for other it is simpler and requires less plus every programmer will instantly know what is going on since it involve an extra use smart pointers to completely avoid memory stuff with many smart programmers like to say best code is the code you have to why do you believe that the code you posted leaks i saw your comment to another post saying code execution command top allocated memory may be completely normal may not depending on your allocation usually the way heaps work is that they often but often shrink is to favor subsequent completely symmetric allocations and frees should allow the application to stabilize at a certain amount of result in continuous growth because the heap is highly likely to give the same block for each my question to you does it grow or does it simply not have asked what to do about a 2d i would use a class to wrap the either use a library believe boost has a array or rolling your own be too something like this may be goes like is technically more efficient to use something like for indexing a matrix wrapper but in this case i chose to simulate native array if efficiency is it can be made as efficient as native another what platform are you developing if it is then i would recommend valgrind to help pinpoint your memory since the code provided is clearly not the know of but i am sure that windows also has memory profiling for a matrix if you insist on using plain old why not just allocate it as a single contiguous block and do simple math on indexing like p new to access an just do width way you do a on the pointer whether it is a 1d or 2d

 is not possible to use managedthreadid in this this is a completely managed concept and has no real representation in the native hence it make any sense to the passing it reason managedthreadid exists is because there is not necessarily a mapping between a native and managed the clr is free to use multiple native threads to run a single managed thread as long as the native thread is compatible with the one it cannot for be in a different com some ways a bit stuck there is no way to guarantee that you will have the same native thread for a given managed you can achieve a very high level of guarantee though if you are for instance running a winforms or wpf application and the call to native code occurs on the ui the reason being that both of these ui frameworks live in sta apartments which makes it very hard even for the clr to switch out from under if in a winforms or wpf application and running this on the ui you can assume a reasonable level of stability for this

 is nothing new or the just talking about native been able to do plugins for the only special thing about is that it allows native code and to talk to each other in a plugin and the little trick where dll can be seen as a singleton object that implements the interface you can use the supports function from the unit to check if the dll and all the methods are you want to do what the talking about in delphi for look at the getprocaddress and freelibrary windows api if you absolutely must have an interface like the article you have to write it either in the dll you wrote the dll by writing an exported function that returns an or in the calling by writing a function that uses getprocaddress to create an interface this requires mucking around with and is usually more trouble than best bet is probably just to do what tim sullivan use tjvpluginmanager from the if you only need native or if you have to talk to

 is quite easy to know the web method is called asmx of the file 4guysfromrolla about they have a technology makes you expose methods as a web service so you can connect it the from everywhere and use it the data between server and you can send big files in a clear you can protect the access to the web service using but it is a pain and quite normally in asmx we use username passsword to give access to a method in plain you are in the different world about web and this is the best technology in to expose services you see the not wcf does not need iis to it can run as a system service on the using a console ambient command in so we say that wcf is a not a web remember asmx need iis to run and will only run hosted in a web wcf you can use ssl to encrypt the communication do that in asmx you need to use web services and it is quite easy to implement you can send big files and securely do that in asmx you need to use message transmission optimization can set the transmission preferences just changing one line of or if you change the xml configuration the security is much etc you get a better general overview with but there is much to expose web services that you do not need to you can use no problem at but if you need to protect the communication do it in can read here some performance comparative between the 2

 is really a design not an algorithmic it turns out that most applications localize keyboard including most microsoft although there are some exceptions in certain not every keyboard shortcut is a only a few of the most common ones should note that this election not to localize accelerators is a rather recent prior to 2000 or it was still quite common to localize shortcuts in some products being for instead of in german and swedish but the pendulum has swung in the opposite perhaps as a consequence of mui and similar few localization tools will help you on i saw this feature as a bullet point on a product never used called visual not sure how useful automatic assignment as a fairly hard problem to automatically decide which character is the best mnemonic representation without domain knowledge of a particular it only makes sense to localize the underlined mnemonic characters on and maybe in most localization service firms are familiar with this and some have tools to detect duplicates in any resources before handing back the localized resource you might actually want to invest in locating or building a tool that can do this duplicate check at and run the tool as part of acceptance regular menu items or keyboard command it can be more confusing than unless you have a fully baked keyboard to command mapping customization

 is really intended as a web server as a framework that fits into a web not as an email i suppose you could put some code into a django web application that starts up an email using the kind of code shown in that question you linked but i really recommend an abuse of the capabilities of dynamic web normal practice is to have separate email and web and for that you would want to look into something like sendmail or for pop3 you would also need something like dovecot or i certainly possible to have the email server notify your web application when emails are received so it can act on if what you want to in response to your yes you are trying to make at least an email an email server is just a program that receives emails may be capable of sending them as but you need could definitely write a small email server in python that just receives these emails and saves the images to the filesystem or a database or be worth asking a new but make it part of your django web keep it as its own separate

 is really only a follow up to john great it can be safe to make stateless methods are pretty much it can sometimes lead to coupling that is hard to consider you have a static method as class staticclassversionone public static void you call is all well and and very until you come across a case where you have to modify the behaviour of the static and find that you are tightly bound to possibly you could modify the code and it would be but if there was other callers dependent on the old need to be accounted for in the body of the in some cases that method body can get pretty ugly or unmaintainable if it tries to balance all these if you split out the methods you may have to modify code in several places to take account of or make calls to new consider if you had created an interface to provide the and given it to now when the behaviour has to a new class can be created to implement the which is more easily and more and that instead is given to the in this scenario the calling classes need to be altered or even and the changes are may or it may not be a likely but i think it is worth

 is slicehost using to serve options are things or called passenger phusion or like are dedicated servers plugins to which run an instance of your rails your host using then probably defaulting to rails comes with a simple cgi script that will serve the but it reloads the app for every i suspect that this is the most likely that your app is running off of the cgi in which would explain the this tends to be a default deployment on many since it require extra configuration on their but it give good your host supports rails supports that fast cgi will open a cgi and keep it open for multiple so you get much better but not nearly as good as mongrel or is it in or the easy way to tell is to go to a page in your app that gives an if it shows you a stack in development which is slower than production mongrel and have startup options to determine whether to run the app in production or development if your database is slow for whatever that will be a big bottleneck as if you do have a good deployment in production try looking into

 is the beginning of another possible solution in perl works as is but could probably be made more sophisticated if it sounds as if all you are concerned about is removing duplicates across the corpus and really care if the last part of one article is in the file for the next one as long as it duplicated if this solution will strip out the duplicate lines leaving only one copy of any given line in the set of files as a can either just run the file in the directory containing the text files with no argument or alternately specify a file name containing the list of files you want to process in the order you want them i recommend the latter as your file names least in the sample files you do not naturally list out in order when using simple commands like on the command line or in the perl thus it necessarily compare the correct files to one another as it just runs down the list or generated by the glob if you specify the you can guarantee that they will be processed in the correct order and it take that long to set it up script simply opens two files and makes note of the first three lines of the second it then opens a new output file file name for the first file and writes out all the lines from the first file into the new output file until it finds the first three lines of the second there is an off chance that there are not three lines from the second file in the last one but in all the files i spot checked that seemed to be the case because of the journal name header and page one line definitely enough as the journal title was often the first line and that would cut things off should also note that the last file in your list of files entered will not be processed have a new file created based off of as it will not be changed by this the open close else glob if ne print open my close my if my my open my close my open my my while 1 and if else print out close added a check for parenthesis in the first line that goes into the regex check for duplicity later on and if found escapes them so that they mess up the duplicity

 issue was reported as a bug to the vs team was closed as not reproducible since the original poster reply i i added my validation to the but i still find a workaround to fix just started all references to any assembly outside of the solution fails to with referenced component could not be when trying to this happens for both 3rd party components 15 or so of as well as all framework basically anything that another project in the same to load some other solutions produced the same creating a new winforms project worked without a problem it worked before reinstalling now that work created new winforms app as well as wpf app and the designer load the assemblies tried targetting and and no visual studio vs with restore to 2 days ago when it was known to be vs and checkout from anyone have any experience with this and knows of a way to get this working my strongest has failed so asking can mark community wiki if windows the same since i see a repair option for vista and still no reinstalled everything that seemed so far looking like just gonna have to backup and reformat i guess unless a solution comes up some time before just backed up data and so no long able to verify any ideas i tried so just leave the bounty to expire on own to top voted answer and as a reference to anyone else who may have this problem referenced component could not be any other component for that

 issue with ssd is that they make real sense only when the schema is normalized to 3nf or thus removing redundant moving a for mess to ssd will not be the mass of redundant data will make ssd too cost that for some existing application means redefining the existing table to encapsulating the normalized tables behind the there is a time penalty on the cpu to synthesize the more denormalized the original the greater the benefit to refactor and move to even on these denormalized schemas will run due to the mass of data which must be retrieved and logs on ssd is not this is a sequential under normal physics of ssd a company named texas memory systems has been building ram based for a long makes this conventional rust duly will do the anandtech the intel drive was the only one which worked that will likely change by the end of but as of now only the intel drives qualify for serious

 it comes to navigating through an html form by hitting the tab internet explorer 7 treats an element with as controls msdn for the first time you hit tab it focusses on the text and the second time it focuesses on the browse this is invisible to problem is i want to use or something similar to allow the user to click what looks like a button and see the file chooser this works by placing an invisible element under the i have managed to change the script to allow you to tab to the hidden element and for this to trigger a css change so the fake button looks like it has the upshot being on browsers other than it looks to the user as if you can tab to the button and activate it as you would cannot work on ie7 because the first tab takes it to the invisible text pressing space adds a space to the invisible file name instead of activating the file i have tried adding an event handler for that calls the but when i do this the event i am depending on seems not to be am beginning to think the only accessible solution on ie7 i will be to replace the whole dialogue with a two part form the first part with a element and upload the second part with all the other form this is unfortunate because ie7 get a less slick user and i have to add all sorts of extra code to allow the form to be submitted in two i would be interested to know if anyone has a way to make element behave like a single to allow javascript to access both controls of the element the dom was not designed we make ie7 treat a file element as a single

 it is calling the function on a yet not constructed which is undefined you detect it i would argue you also should not try to detect nothing which would happen likely by compared to for example calling a function on an already deleted trying to catch every and all possible mistakes is just about the name declared is visible already in its for other useful consider is a common idiom in c and which still works in i like by herb sutter about null references are likewise the gist try to protect from cases that the language clearly forbids and in particular are in their general case impossible to diagnose you will get a false security over which becomes quite train your understanding of the language and design interfaces in a way raw that reduces the chance of doing and likewise in many cases are not explicitly but rather are left partially because some things are rather difficult to diagnose and partially because undefined behavior lets the implementation design alternative behavior for it instead of completely ignoring it which is used often by existing the above case for any implementation is free to throw an there are other situations that are likewise undefined behavior which are much harder to diagnose efficiently for the having an object in a different translation unit accessed before it was constructed is such an example which is known as the initialization order

 it will throw an i can think of two reasons for putting the extra checking you later go back and change the method to do something before calling and forget to put the check in at that you could end up with a side effect before the exception is which the stack trace will show at the and probably with a message with the parameter this could be confusing to the caller of who can see a parameter just to save me having to write it yet again call to will throw an a is another extension method and assuming the implementation in is being documented to throw an try it if you believe making this you do a lot of checks like this you may want to make it simpler to do i like the following extension static void t string where t if throw new example method in the question can then static bool return alternative would be to write a version which checked the value returned like static t t string where t if throw new return can then call it static bool return is also helpful for copying parameters in constructors int might want an overload without the argument name for places where not

 it works because it does not dereference anything through the implicit as soon as you do not but i think null pointer dereferences are done by rw protecting first 1k of memory so there is a small chance of nullreferencing not getting caught if you only dereference it past 1k line some instance variable that would get allocated very class a char int would possibly be uncaught when a is you only declared a which is allocated on

 java language is what it you find much to change the core language without moving to a new language getting from management might not be as hard as you think to move to i was in a similar position as you a few years you can start introducing groovy into a few areas of your software that make great place to start is to start using it for unit essentially when you write a class in it compiles down to java as long as you have the groovy jars on your others may not even know it is groovy by using it for you can demonstrate how it simplifies your code and makes things you should be able to sell that to keep introducing it in other new areas where a dynamic language would save you some groovy and java mix very well together since they use the same set of core

 java way is that you should consider what data most suits your remember that in java a list is an not a concrete data you should declare the strings as a and then initialize it using the arraylist strings new separation of abstract data type and specific implementation is one the key aspects of object oriented arraylist implements the list abstract data type using an array as its underlying access speed is virtually identical to an with the additional advantages of being able to add and subtract elements to a list this is an operation with an and that if you decide to change the underlying implementation later on you for if you realize you need synchronized you can change the implementation to a vector without rewriting all your the arraylist was specifically designed to replace the array construct in most if java was being designed entirely possible that arrays would have been left out altogether in favor of the arraylist arrays keep all the data in a contiguous chunk of memory would the use of an array to store thousands of strings cause problems all collections store only references to not the objects both arrays and arraylist will store a few thousand references in a contiguous so they are essentially you can consider that a contiguous block of a few thousand references will always be readily available on modern this does not guarantee that you will not run out of memory of just that the contiguous block of memory requirement is not difficult to

 know anything about but i can tell you about unit need to factor things for your server might run in a thread and do some where it does the work should be inside a you also probably have a request make the tcp take the request object as a then unit test as at the beginning of the setup the and pass it to the tcp server actually have the server open sockets or you are just unit testing the methods that do the and only testing the handling of the you are testing sockets or network reliability or anything like you need to test that stuff	
 know anything about flight and you listed anything in particular they consist so this is mostly a guess about writing a fs in excels at exploratory i think that since fss been around so and there are free and that it would not benefit as much from this type of sims are mostly written in natively compiled if looking for pure runtime in lisp this tends to mean type declarations and other if you get the performance you want with naive your might end up looking a lot like and lisp as good at c at writing lot of a is interfacing to a graphics library like which is written in depending on how your ffi opengl bindings this make your code look like you might not have the big win that lisp does a web app consists of generating a tree structure of plain which lisp is great took a glance at the flightgear source and i see a lot of structural boilerplate even a straight port might end up being half the use strings for keys all over the place have they use xml for config files have a runtime simply switching to native lisp constructs here could be big win for minimal looks at all even the simply a matter of keeping everything and lisp will be great at this because be a lot the neat thing about lisp is that you can use oo for organizing the and fp for computation within each i say just start writing and see where it takes

 know doing something wrong but figure out a better am developing a website which is going to allow users to setup their own like i have only 1 basic login and access to each mini website is provided via the way i am doing this right now a new mini website is created say i create 2 roles in my and user creating the mini website is given the role and every other user wanting to join this mini website is given the role can view data from any however to add one must be a member of that mini site have the role problem that i am facing is that by doing a role based having to do loads of stuff 2 controls which work on the property are basically useless to me now because along with the isauthenticated i must also check if the user has the proper guessing there is a better way to architect the system but i am not sure website is being developed in 2 on iis a for service	
 know exactly the full range of but i can tell you a couple of things off the apps is built on top of using is pretty much what google apps cheer and so expect it to integrate with google apps better than apps has restrictions built into it that you circumvent these limitations are not related to any particular rather they are built into the fabric of so to worry much about performance of the framework try to improve your it will certainly payback will eventually move to django and plus they are updating google apps do use memcache an so take that into consideration and utilize

 know i am not the only one who does not like progress bars or time estimates which give unrealistic estimates in best examples are installers which jump from to in 10 seconds and then take an hour to complete the final of the time programmers just estimate the steps to complete a task and then display as a ignoring the fact that each step might take a different time to for if you insert rows into a the insertion time can increase with the number of inserted rows or the time to copy files does not only depend on the size of the file but also on the location on the disk and how fragmented it i asked myself if anybody already tried to model this and maybe created a with a configurable robust i know that it is difficult to give robust estimates because external factors user runs other play their there is also a solution that uses profiling to set up a better or one could use machine learning anybody know of advanced solutions for this connection to i found the article the progress very it shows how progress bars can change the perception of time and how you can use those insights to create progress bars that seem to be can think of ways how to manually tune the time and even with a i will have to fine tune the but i think this problem could be tackled with statistical of the estimator would collect data during the process to create better estimates for the next i do now is to take the average time something took in the previous step grouped by type and normalized by file size of and take this average as estimate for the next steps counting in different types and i know are better statistical to create estimators and i wonder if anybody applied those to the time estimates for progress bars

 know if there is this modules implemented yet but what i can load balance is what i can argue random placing of jobs is best bet unless you know far more information how load will come in future and in most of cases you really what you the client connects all nodes are examined to see which has the least load and then the ip of the loaded server is forwarded back to the you know that all those least loaded node will not be highest loaded just in next how you know that all those high loaded nodes which you will not include in list will not drop load just in next you really know it unless you have very rare measure your performance and set probability be chosen depend of choose node randomly regardless of current use this as initial when you set it then you can try make up some more sophisticated i bet that it will be very hard work to beat this initial trust very to be more clear in one subtle i strongly argue that you predict future load from current and historical load but you should use knowledge about tasks durations probability and current decomposition of this work is so hard to try

 know if with newer versions of builder and some probably guess it probably but why on earth would you want end up with a version of mysql compiled in an untested environment instead of the distribution versions provided by mysql themselves that gain lots of testing i think of a single advantage of doing but i can think of plenty of your problem is that builder is the only development environment you have to be aware that you can compile using visual which ms will give you for you really want to go about doing be wanting build and following their instructions for visual studio will work to get you something you can start then need to hack around looking for appropriate compiler options and so

 let me first describe my i work in an it department for a sized and basically the only real developer a second guy joins in for his own i programm mostly in of course i only programm for internal need some mobile question is how should i document my a highly dynamic environment features and bug fixes i implement are tested by me during and go often within a if i technical documentation like msdn or even overview diagramms those would take me more time to sync than the whole programming i feel a waste of time because i would be the only one who ever read do understand that if i get or forget this documentation would be of course you are right the quesion is how much and try using the comments for the public exposed parts but as a believer in code the comments mostly restates in plain text what you can read from the itself using the remarks section is the key but if you have 30 lines of code with a 15 line in front it just looks for posting it here but our firewall rejects json should a development shop document their

 looking to allow a user to enter a date and time to send out a mass email through although thinking it might be best to use a command to trigger the php wondering if there is a way on to do this without adding a cronjob to run every 15 minutes to check if there is a mass email to be not that this is an intensive but just be much prettier with a cronjob to add and i thinking this would be somewhat similar to a windows scheduled task that has an end date and is set to delete if not scheduled is there a way to trigger a process at a future date	
 looking to create a new thread that is capable of creating and dealing with window then you can use the function on the thread object and set it to also likely need to call inside the method for this thread in order to create your message bear in mind that subject to the same that you have in any other thread you can only interact with the handle for a control on the thread inside which it was so you do anything on your other ui thread without switching

 looks like a good article on the the oom gist is that linux when a process asks for more linux will give it that even if it is claimed by another under the assumption that nobody actually uses all of the memory they ask the process will get exclusive use of the memory it has allocated when it actually uses not when it asks for this makes allocation and might allow you to and allocate more memory than you really once processes start using this linux might realize that it has been too generous in allocating memory it and will have to kill off a process to free some the process to be killed is based on a score taking into account runtime processes are memory usage processes are less and a few other including a value you can adjust to make a process less likely to be all described in the article in a lot more and here is that explains pretty well how a process is chosen with some kernel code the great thing about this is that it includes some commentary on the behind the various	
 looks like a pretty reasonable unit test to you are providing a simple test that checks the results of calling that it help you with any new properties as the existing test would still perhaps you could use reflection to iterate over all the properties of the object and check they are seems like a slightly odd why not just initialise a new to those values to start that way there is no risk that another coder will create an and forget to call

 looks like so i give it away but notice a few win when you have three of the same thing in a in a or along a not that you need to check whether there are three noughts or three crosses in a but rather that there are of the same in a could start by writing a function which determines whether a or diagonal has three of the same kind of thing that thing a blank then call that function once for each and

 looks like when you instantiate wmpsettings as a jacob is actually doing something funny to wrap the component in a new media player object instead of retrieving the settings property asking you tried wmpsettings also went back and read the original question that got you into using jacob and i can suggest a different approach in case you wind up spinning your wheels on this for too had setup a web application which interacted with a shoutcast server running from winamp on the desktop of a specific user that was currently logged in to the web app i use com to communicate directly with the instance of winamp from within the context of the web application so i setup a simple winamp bridge application that ran on the shoutcast desktop and allowed the web application to make a socket connection from wmp sure you can find some wrappers like the code for you can find if you do a text search on me know if you need any specific examples for setting this

 main reason i would avoid this typedef is that it allows the type to lie to the take vs both type names encode the size of the value into the this is not an uncommon practice in i personally use the size specific typedefs to avoid confusion for myself and other people reading my much of our code has to run on both 32 and 64 bit platforms and many people know the various sizing rules between the types like eliminate the i had not read the 4th paragraph of your question and instead just saw the type i would have assumed it was some scenario specific way of having a fast 16 bit and i obviously would have been wrong for me it would violate the surprise rule of if it had another distinguishing acronym in the name it would be less likely to confuse maybe

 main with c for writing reliable and easy to extend programs is that in c you can do the first step would be to write a simple framework that restricts just a most good programmers do that this the restrictions would be mostly to make it easy to define a within whatever level of isolation you has a reputation of being and threads also need significant time to so you might want to use a cooperative which can be far more and you could even make it preemptive think what erlang to get set a pool of threads and make all of them complete to run the important part would be to create an appropriate library of immutable data so that using them of the standard your functions would be just a matter of setting a good api for message passing and not but at least it seem like changing the language	
 mainly not a question of how to make service and communication protocol is not the main issue with wcf you can expose your application methods via spectre of merely a question of application question here is how do you like to implement if your application is normal windows then it have just because service should not have so need separate gui is standalone application that somehow communicates with your say via in this case plugins should also be implemented in two plugin for service and plugin for i it would be too complex to of 1st both service and gui are packed in one it looks in what mode started or and either monitors mail or shows since this is one the configuration is also the so you will have single registry for i that in gui mode application will search for started service and configure drawback gui could be run only make a sort of gui service sends gui to simple which shows in this case you have one place for all app code and but executed in part in in part in client but you also need such universal client a little more about variant 3 we see that solution already exists it is web it would be simplest to implement your service as part a web and gui would be another if you are unfamiliar with html and javascript you can implement gui using you can host right in your is the good but i afraid it adds unnecessary

 makes more sense to ask about a particular aspect of a bit like asking windows key parts of linq are for from a these are representations of code as for an expression tree could represent the notion of a string call the length property on and return the the fact that these exist as rather than as compiled code means that linq providers such as linq to sql can analyze them and convert them into these are expressions like x int x expressions are converted either into or these are expressions like are still statically just the compiler generates an immutable type for you with properties and these are usually used with which allows the type of a local variable to be inferred from its initialization these are expressions like person in are translated by the compiler into a form which use query overload resolution etc is applied which is absolutely key to being able to use the same query syntax with multiple data without the compiler having any knowledge of types such as the above expression would be translated these are static methods which can be used as if they were instance methods of the type of the first for an extension method like static int string return letter letter then be used like foo count that the implementation of uses another extension most of the relevant then there are the implementations of the standard query in linq providers such as linq to objects and linq to sql i have a presentation about how reasonably simple to implement linq to objects on the page of the in depth web way providers such as linq to sql work is generally via the at their they translate expression trees into other query and then construct appropriate objects with the results of executing those that cover everything you were interested if anything in particular you still want to know just edit your question and have a

 may be interested in something like or one of the other theoretical algebras for dealing with there are csp libraries for most but if the language designed for it requires a bit of discipline to use but every kind of boils down to some fairly simple avoid shared mutable and understand exactly when and why each thread may have to block while waiting for another shared data simply each thread process in csp is allowed to communicate with others through blocking since there is no shared race conditions go since message passing is it becomes easy to reason about and literally prove that no deadlocks can good which is easier to retrofit into existing code is to assign a priority or level to every lock in your and make sure that the following rules are followed holding a lock at level only acquire new locks of lower levels locks at the same level acquired at the same as which always acquire all the requested locks same global order that order will but that tries to acquire one locks at level must them in the same order as thread would do anywhere the these rules mean that it is simply impossible for a deadlock to then you just have to worry about mutable shared

 me if this has been asked i did a search but find anything that specifically answered this but be happy to be taking a peek at both the entity framework and linq to and while i like the systems of course the linq a little skeptical on the taken query results and inspected and they appear to implement the standard interfaces and more importantly leading me to believe that binding them to a grid anything is going to use reflection to my entity this seems like a comparatively expensive especially when all of the code is generated anyway and could implement the anyone have any insight into is reflection used to the value of the if does this have a performance impact and does anyone have any idea why they went this actually concentrating on whether or not is implemented somewhere along the as what has the capability to provide an explicit mechanism for defining and interacting with properties without resorting to while i have a linq to sql project i did inspect a simple entity framework entity query and it did not appear to implement does anyone know if just looking at something or if not why this is the accepting i thought it might be helpful for others if i posted some simple code i used to seamlessly implement his i put the following in the static constructor for my static type in if new this is for linq to sure an equivalent version could be written for the entity this will scan the assembly for any types with the attribute and add a custom provider for each of entity to sql data binding use	
 me it seems boost has the most traction for new libraries and the fact that many of them got accepted into the upcoming standard speaks for use ace and boost myself and the reasons i chose them are that they are mature have a large strong user community which makes sure they will be maintained and enhanced and that i can get good quality professional we use for our support and are highly ace is a much older library than boost and one of goals is to support more exotic platforms it does not use so much bleeding edge technology as i am using a mixture of ace and boost and am very happy with that quite know why you put wxwidgets in the as it is mostly a graphics ui but if i had to do some ui projects i would go with mostly because this is also a widely used library of the kde desktop is built on top of and therefore well maintained and i would have access to a large user base for questions and

 mention your if not sql the specifics of how to get the data might be but the advice is fundamentally the at for but the first thing to do is to follow advice and scan for execution plans using management studio if you are running sql guessing see is that for small date the optimizer picks a reasonable query but that when the date range is it picks something completely likely involving either table scans or index and possibly joins that lead to very large temporary the execution plan analyzer will reveal all of scan means that the optimizer thinks that grinding over the whole table or the whole index is cheaper for what you are trying to do than seeking specific you eventually want to do is get indexes and the syntax of your query set up such that you keep index seeks in the query plan for your query regardless of the date failing that the scans you require are filtered as well as you can manage to minimize temporary recordset size and thereby avoid excessive reads and

 most important thing is to understand why the choice was made and use the team to determine if this is something that you would want to team buying is important for these kind of decisions and the team is more than just the source control trees contain things such as so there is a legitimate chance that the structure was determined by multiple parties to find a common use tfs where i as we do have a common root folder called control that is the main folder that all team projects live this choice was made because of the extreme by all that the drive would get cluttered with various you have the option to map multiple so what you do on your local machine is dictated by the structure on the my personal and my as is to use a single workspace mapping to the source control given the shelving functionality in there is not a concern about having multiple copies checked since they can be shelved if something else needs to be worked build server has the same as this in no matches the deployment builds are dropped based upon the criteria of the the only time this presents a problem is when absolute paths are in configuration for since we are not using absolute paths definition in our developer this is a

 my experience going 2000 items per container indexed is not the end of the what is is if you start to use multiple lists that are linked to each other through then it becomes a big pain when you want to filter a child based on a value in its parent that is not part of the reporting on this data can be very slow if you have a lot of records involved in the inclination in the past has been to use 3rd normal but that work to well with sharepoint lists so i would consider a fairly flat if you have relationships mostly want to use separate

 my specific i am making use of a discriminator column this means that my jpa implementation creates a table with a special this column contains the class name of the for my table can have subclasses of and these class names would be in the column so that when the entitymanager loads the entity from the it knows which type of class to tried two ways of converting entity types and both feel like dirty a native query to manually do an update on the changing its this works for entities whose property constraints are a new entity of the target do a call to move over the save the new then call a named query which manually replaces the new id with the old id so that all the foreign key constraints are problem with is that when you manually change this jpa know how to this entity to the persistance it expects a with id not a with id it fails here i could probably do an and detach all the but since this is a service it would wipe pending changes for all users of the problem with is that when you delete the all of the properties you have set to will be deleted as this is bad because only trying to swap in a different not delete all the extended object the problems of have made it all but unusable for so given up on trying to get it to the more elegant of the hacks is definitely and i have made some progress in this the key is to first get a reference to the underlying hibernate session using hibernate as your jpa and call the method to remove only that single object from your persistance unfortunitely there is no pure jpa support for here is some sample make sure we save any pending user remove the user instance from the persistence final session session update the final string sqlstring user set where final query query problem here load the user with its new return the manual which throws this detached entity passed to can see that the of which has a onetomany is causing some i know enough about going on behind the scenes to crack this the only thing that works so far is to change dtype as shown in the above then call completely understand the ramifications of clearing the entire persistence and i would have liked to get working on the particular entity being updated to change entity type in

 needs to be explicitly told if the data you are grouping by is larger than 1024 bytes for so if your data in the fingerprint column is larger than 1024 bytes you should use set the variable for details about values and about how to set to a larger number so that the group by wont silently use only part of your data for certain that mysql will group your data the following query will set the duplicate flag so that the first fingerprint record has duplicate set to and any subsequent fingerprint records have duplicate set to update mytable join as minrow from mytable m2 group by m3 on set keep in mind that this solution does not take nulls into account and if it is possible for the fingerprint field to be null then you would need additional logic to handle that

 neglect the overhead of transferring the data among ethernet degrades pretty rapidly under load think the sustained transfer rate is something like of the your link will really only do 30mb of heavy once you saturate your link at the db adding more app servers because you be able to get the data out any on an app server also put you at the mercy of the slowest we saw performance tank at a client and discovered that the primary app server had and the recovery strategy was to have the machine fail over to a virtual machine running on one of the other kind of a neat but certainly not as also seen slowdowns when routers fail and suddenly all your peer servers are three or four hops away instead of being on the same

 never been a fan of the dogma of a single assertion per it just seem practical to me you end up with a lot of fluff around what interested if got multiple issues only have one test you fix the run it spot the next fix that and repeat until it no great not saying that you should be testing huge amounts of functionality in each test but going to the other extreme pragmatic would normally only go for one condition per test though so if your constructors would actually throw exceptions for null check each of those in a separate easy to accidentally miss something

 never heard of anything like you getting an error log file from vb6 when you load the form into the ide before it gets the log file has the same filename as the form file but with a filename for if errors occurred when loading visual basic would create a log file named the error messages you might see there are in the a in the windows event see whether it records any interesting problems against the vb6 you using any weird maybe one of them is somehow corrupting the frm or frm files are just text as you obviously know the format is documented in the vb6 can you see any corruption in the frm in a text if you remove any properties defined in the does it still think i would try creating a new project and a new and then use the ide to copy and paste all the control definitions into it no play with the new see whether it has the same maybe you can recreate the form this way without the if the new form does have the do the same thing but only take half the maybe you can find a problem control by

 no good it do what you were asked you were supposed to find the last blank after a nonblank before the output line your program even remotely try to do it seems to strive for finding the first blank after characters did the 5 came what if all the words had 9 however it do that because of your manipulation with the newls line probably because you check for a condition that never changes throughout the last but not storing the whole file in a buffer is not because of two buffer is bound to overflow on large if it would never people still like you for storing a gigabyte file in memory just to cut it into think you should start rethink your algorithm corner and only after start i suggest the file output the line in a buffer big enough to hold the largest output for the character break at in the print it you can terminate the string with and print with copy what you print to the start of the proceed from	
 no good solution to this that aware the ide seems to require a configuration for each set of command line arguments to the so if n different sets of arguments are required as it sounds like the case is here n different configurations will be just how the ide it but one rarely wins in a fight against visual so i personally have always given in and created as many configurations as a and and yes the ide should ideally provide some better mechanism for managing the combinations but just and it actually take as long to set up as it feels like at the i understand can take some of the pain away by allowing easy sharing of configuration settings between so those miniscule text boxes in vs are only used to set up the settings that differ between this may make them still worth this something used myself only discovered it delete

 not sure exactly what your representation problem so i suspect you have this question from a misunderstanding of a chromosome theoretically the chromosome string does not have to be recombined explicitly on integer boundaries if you take the extra step of demarcating your individual which would allow you to recombine on a this solves the problem of a such as your recombining genes is just a matter of adding another variant to the mutation specifically this element or nuke this in addition to the standard element from a or element from if your gene is breakable into discrete as your path

 not sure if the culture is really against scaffolding or but for love what i do know is that there was sort of a small backlash against scaffolding for a this was because basically every rails tutorial was basically just type scaffolding post have a not actually being the the community started to pull back on using scaffolding as that kind of because when you do not real power of and the reason that i love is for its rapid prototyping you can generate half of your web start coding the back and still have a usable interface to actually play around with how everything works without worrying about writing interface	
 not sure if this assists with your but one thing i learned rather recently and took to heart is to have your data unique identifier implementation not propagate directly outside of the data but to be wrapped in an for here is an interface which wraps a interface where t class a string representation of the domain the model originated string origin the model instance identifier for the model object that this refers this is a database file or some other unique expected data type of the keydatatype performs an equality check on the two model identifiers and returns if they are otherwise is all implementations must also override the equal identifier to compare if the identifiers are otherwise is bool business logic which may have in the past passed around as unique identifiers from a identity column in your database is now passed as public iperson retrieval logic data layer will then have a class which implements and populates its internal data type with the physical unique this insulates your business layer from any changes you may have at the data such as replacing your key identifiers with

 not sure if this is feasible or as i used the entity but have you tried running the update first and checking the rowcount inserting if no rows were this may be faster than catching generally a bad practise to use exceptions for control and often slows things down you can write the sql then the fastest way to do it would be to get all the data into a temporary table and then update what exists and insert the rests in andrea example you should get slightly better results by using a left join on the original table in the select in your and excluding any rows with values from the original table that are not into from join original on is

 not sure that there is a simple way to modify the behaviour of the existing udp code via a new would be simpler is to take the udp code and create a new module with a new ip protocol and modify this code to implement your reliable udp you will need to rename all the external symbols so the names dont clash with the existing find out where it registers the protocol number and change and then update the makefile to build your new module and probably put an entry in a look in to see what protocol ids are allocated it looks like that cannot be built as a you will need to look at some of the other protocols as or to see how to make your code into a

 nothing new to the data access code from your business but always on the for the to achieve have the following this is my business this is a list of user would fetch orange objects from the data store by calling therefore orangelist has to have a reference to the data access layer so it has the idataprovider will work for but the problem is that we cannot fetch a single orange by itself we always have to go via that or both orange and orangelist would have to descend from some common object that would hold the this a or is my approach way off the mark in the first are in light of the discussion i checked out the repository for my i think it is a good idea to separate still further the repository from the the repository is how i get and save but still know i delegate that to the which could be a number of those listed in the clarify orange does not know how to a pure business object and is that the case my is to support an old which accesses a database but this lets me wrap this up and keep it at from my new terms of assembly to prevent circular references it looks like gonna have a a and a all i got the idea of the repository data access layer from business

 noticed a few regarding stress testing but more interested in knowing a good way to establish a bench mark of what my physical web server can working on a production system right now that seems to be slowing to a near halt on a daily and no one can seem to figure out what is causing the this is your standard set up web db i have created some simple pages that can do a few simple things that using to establish a benchmark for stress testing that i can later user when comparing with the production system that is already in have already built a sample aspx page that simply returns back some web server statistics about the box nothing maybe a few lines of also created a simple web service that will test a db connection given the correct again nothing heavy just opening a db connection and a sample query that really do i would like to know is a good stress level that the following tests should operate in using web application stress and curious what most people would expect the and the ranges should i already know at what point the web server starts its around 20 stress level and 10 stress multiplier give or which results in about page requests trying to find out if that number is way too and if some sort of indication that an issue between the client and the web server or a hardware issue of some or if more of an indication that nothing wrong and that the system is just too since i originally wrote this post the code has been moved to a server running windows 2003 utilizing iis like to know now is if i set up a relatively simple such as a basic file that just serves up a small what would you expect the page requests sec i could achieve from a stress is a good benchmark test for load testing a production system running

 notion that would appear useful in your app is the concept of song a song source would essentially be an enumerable item that provides access to this could firstly be an way you have the abstract concept of a piece of code providing lists of the actual player would access any implementation of to get the next song to and play the playing i am afraid i help you if all else fails you could create m3u files from your song sources and start winamp via passing the newly created in this sounds like a neat version you want to code everything you may need a piece of code to read id3 tags from an mp3 file you are playing mp3 you should see this as independent functionality and chances are that there is already something the id3 tagging is not very if i remember well there are defined byte offsets at the head of the mp3 on this you should be able to implement song sources that consider id3 tags in order to decide what song should be part of the there is the that is a whole world on its especially if you would have a skinnable but with a decent wpf book and some proof of concepts you should be on your way to get something

 of for using balsamiq to mock up the would really have a think about make sure your users are happy with only seeing 3 or so categories on screen at offer as many alternatives as you can think and allow them to pick a couple to go forward to a for could you provide them with an aggregate and allow a drill down with the prototype they can make the final decision with mocked up offer anything you are unhappy you are going to be responsible for it working in the you are already past the prototype stage and happy with the as a rough structure i would start with a first of all see what 3rd party control library will offer out of the these control libraries always offer significantly more customisation than the base infragistics is one i would feel able to recommend generally but i confirm it will do the kind horizontal scrolling you would want to make a custom cell implementation for the title you are unlikely to get the look you want out of the this is pretty straight forward to scrollbar will be tricky unless a 3rd party datagrid offers only scrolling a portion of the columns assume you want the 2 columns on the right to be onscreen at all if you get a control to do this for i would start by trying to fake put the and columns into a completely new grid you can then put a horizontal scroll bar onto the left gridview and keep them visually together by dropping them both into a pane you will need to data bind them both separately to the correct columns so that they are kept in synch with the underlying subtotal controls at the bottom i would keep as simple text boxes and bind them directly to your domain model calculations for these

 of i would definitely for the worry about the time save using typed versus creating your own business that is usually not where you will spend most of your development i prefer using business objects situation i would want to implement a one that addresses all issues you may this should implement an entire use starting on the retrieving data from the database and returning it to the you should feel confident about your implementation before about choice of wcf is definitely a good choice for communication between your client applications and the service i suppose that both your clients as well as your service layer will become that makes things a lot easier since interoperability between different platforms for is still not trivial although it should work in most

 of is there a reason you do all this in assuming a lot about your but think at least might even be easier to do in hardware if your area of of you have instructions to do this in software that you must the ir sensors are already outputting variable you just scale the voltage output from the sensors to drive the assuming the wheels are driven by motors and spinning one faster than the other to get it to then you might even get a smoother driving pattern as you as opposed to the standard software which is you could implement a this could take care of the delay as just throw a between state 0 and state 1 then use the voltage output from the door sensor to trigger state 2 if you you can split it into two 2 and 3 with another timer between the the wheel motors are only active in state and release the missile trigger when state 3

 of the information about the of the class should always be as a side effect of manipulating the for example the count property is based on the internal storage of the data the array properties that depend on certain conditions of the state of the class may need to be for exaple a property might depend on orders in the for those properties you have to evaluate the use of the class and decide if the cost of calculating the value as you add and remove items from the collection is cheaper then scannig the entire collection each time the property is guidlines do suggest however that properties do not execute complex code and that repeated access of the property does not have any or performance so for properties that represent calculated data it might be better to use a method this indicates to the developer using your library that the calculation might take some time and they should hold on to the value for the duratino of their	
 of the largest pitfalls of code coverage is that people just talk about code coverage without actually specifying type of code coverage they are talking the characteristics of c2 and even higher levels of code coverage are so just talking about even make achieving full path coverage is pretty much if your program has decision you need tests depending on the every single bit in a value is a decision so to achieve full path coverage for an extremely simple function that just adds two you need 18446744073709551616 if you only have you already need achieving c0 coverage is important thing to is that code coverage does tell you what code was it only tells you what code was you can try it out take a codebase that has code remove all the assertions from the now the codebase has but does not test a single code coverage does not tell you only not w

 of which engine you there are some key concepts to you are dealing with so many the main one is that of level of detail make sure your objects have realistic lod associated with for you bother to render the model of the screw when viewing the whole when closer to it yet still far enough a version of the screw is good enough for you can do tricks like virtual earth and tile your data is related to culling is going to be very but probably dealt with any of those engines you have already you are dealing with gis check out still in early but backed by a lot of good and designed to handle large quantities of they even have ways to embed video as a you are dealing in as you i really would take a look at it is a 3d gis not a game it is which means you have to worry about rendering as you might have to with other have all the constructs you need fast which entity you classes with easy controls for conditional is integrated into the engine as part of the this means that you can even define what things looked like at a previous point in time and go back and forth on the difference between a 3d engine and a game engine can get pretty from what the key difference is that game engines are more worried about making things look good than for we used the unreal engine to render our but we had to make everything to different scales than it looked but not to this might make a difference when dealing with details down to screws as you are little i do not work for but i have personally met the engineers that are creating this they are integrating the latest gpu and rendering so it is by far one of the best engines it leverages knowledge and technology used by their main application which is used by many people for astronomical

 of you are rightfully concerned because circular dependencies between packages are problems that come out of it grow in importance with the size of the but no reason to tackle this situation on should organize your classes by placing classes that you reuse together in the same if you have for example abstractneuron and place them in the same if you now have implementations humanneuron and place these in the same package for example you might have only one type of for example baseconnection and many different the principle stays the you place baseconnection together with humanneuron in its own package together with humansignal virtualneuron together with virtualsignal a connection a neuron so it be in the this is not that nor correct to be say you placed all your neurons in the same neither this is unless you reuse all your implementations take a look at scheme i described either your project is so small you place all in the single or you start organizing packages as more details take a look at common reuse classes in a package are reused if one of the classes in a you reuse

 others have said you do what you are if you describe the problem you are trying to solve maybe someone can are you trying to uniquely identify your could you use a or the session id perhaps instead of the ip the address you see on the server be the as you say that would be a huge the address for a home user on broadband will be the address at their so every device inside the house will appear on the outside to be the but the router uses nat to ensure that traffic is routed to each device for users accessing from an office environment the address may well be the same for all sites that use ip address for id run the risk of getting it very wrong the examples you give are good ones and they often for example my office is in the the breakout point i to be on the is in another country where our main it facility so from my office my ip address appears to be not in the for this reason i access uk only web such as the bbc iplayer my employer is probably very happy about at any given time there would be or even thousands of people at my company who appear to be accessing the web from the same ip you are writing server code you can never be sure what the ip address you see is refering fact some users like it this some people deliberately use an annoymising proxy to further confound for security or privacy reasons they route their web traffic via a proxy so that you know who or where that user you say your machine address is different to the ip address shown on how are you finding out your machine if you are just looking locally using or something like that i would expect it to be different for the reasons i outlined if you want to double check what the outside world thinks have a look at link on will provide you some background on

 others perceive your code as being buggy then it is too perception is more important than it matter if you only had 1 to be perceived as buggy if it was only 1 that would mean you created some fairly visible someone else we really tell for your situation if 10 bugs is too many because we would need to know the type of i would suggest that you look at the types of bugs you are creating to see if there are any did you not understand the were there many off by one logic then evaluate whether these are bugs that you should have if figure out a way to not inject those types of bugs next errors are almost always cases that you should have requirements and interface errors are more understandable as words mean different things to different people no matter how detailed you write them if you understood what the requirement meant and still had the bug then that requirement error is not pointed out that 3 or 4 errors per ksloc is that seems high too but been on projects that were worse maybe it is those same projects did not have very good developers if it is not an obscure error or a misinterpretation then the bug should not be in the if it is then you doing your job so maybe 10 is too maybe it depends on the types of errors you are

 perhaps the best real world example in consider the lists implemented in this where the list chaining aspect is backed directly into the type rather than as a separate can be extremely powerful and they come however with a variety of trade obvious one is code you must bake this logic in each techniques such as extending a base class providing the pointer are messy lose strong typing without and often unacceptable from a performance point of is that you are limited to one implementation per you cannot make a singly linked structure into a doubly linked one without inserting an extra field in every instance and updating all the relevant

 personal ideal is to write enough commentary so that reading just the comments explains how and why a function is intended to be how it should usually come out from well chosen variable names and clear way to achieve at least on the comment is to use a tool such as from the start coding each new function by writing the comment describing what it is for and how it should be doxygen configured have document generation included as a build and read the resulting only comment template that might be helpful would be one that sketches in the barest beginning of the doxygen comment but even that might be too you want the generated documentation to explain what is important without cluttering it with worthless placeholder text that will never get

 php in the database is a bad design smell in even though in this case you are pretty sure it can never contain unsafe it is always good to minimize the number of assumptions or defenses like that you have to if you store php code in the then an attack in which an attacker gains access to your database quickly becomes a lot more turning into an attack in which an attacker can run arbitrary i know that having your database compromised like this is highly but nonetheless it is good security practice not to let even an unlikely situation compromise your system more than it needs people that should without be avoided in php always an this i think that i would have to say that using would be the best solution for because you are already storing php code in the so using is not going to increase your risk any further than recommend try to validate the code before you by being conservative in what you assume that somehow an attacker got into your database even thought that is at least give some serious thought to rewriting your application so that php code is not stored in a if you are storing complex data think about something like json or even xml safe parsers exist for sorry if this answer seems a bit i just happen to feel this sort of thing is very

 php version is out of php has been in the area for awhile and while there are not massive there are enough changes that i would say to test anything older is an unfair is on the verge of becomming final and you should include that in your benchmarks as there are massive improvements to php as well as being the last version of if you really want to split hairs php 6 is also in and a heavy overhaul totally different languages can be interesting but forget you are comparing apples to and the biggest bottleneck in any app is waiting on so the biggest factor is your database comparing php vs python vs purely on speed is pointless as all 3 of them will execute in less than 1 second but yet you can easily wait seconds on your database depending on your hardware and what you are you are worried what is taking the absolute wrong approach to choosing a there are more important such as in how easily can i find skilled devs in that how much do those skilled devs how much roi does the language how feature rich is the

 pretty much tried every python web framework that and it took me a long time to realize there a silver bullet each had its own advantages and i started out with and heartily enjoyed being able to control almost everything at a lower level without much but then i discovered and i have been using it ever tools like catwalk and the web console are invaluable to with turbogears 2 coming out which brings wsgi and after reading up on the religious debates between the django and wsgi really torn between it the right learning spending valuable time writing functionality that already exists in django and other as opposed to using django or some framework that does everything for the downsides with the latter that i can see are pretty not learning anything in the i ever need to do anything lower level going to be a overhead required for just a basic site which uses authentication is i guess my question which is the better or is it just a matter of and should i suck it up and use django if it achieves what i want with minimal fuss want authentication and a crud interface to my i tried and but authkit and repoze scared me as well as the number of steps involved to just setup basic i looked at but the documentation seems and when referencing simple features like authentication or a crud various wiki pages and documentation seemed to contradict each with different hacks for versions and to lott for pointing out that i clear my question which of the following is worthwhile in the long but not painful in the short some sort of middle learn or stick with a if the i would appreciate a suggestion as to whether i should give django another stick with turbogears or venture into some other i have tried but seem to find a good enough crud application that i could plop in and use right vs other python web

 problem i was working on recently got me to wishing that i could lop off the front of a kind of like a at if you truncating a file at the back end is a common we do without even thinking much about but lopping off the front of a sounds ridiculous at but only because been trained to think that but a lop operation could be useful in some simple example not the only or necessarily the best is a fifo adding new items to the end of the file and pulling items out of the file from the the file grows over time and a huge empty space at the with current file there are several ways around this each item is copy items up to replace the although it solution is very the size of the empty space and when it reaches size or percentage of file move everything truncate the this is efficient than the but still costs time are moved in the a circular queue in adding new items to the hole front of the file as items this can be quite if you mind of things getting out in the if you do the potential to move items but a circular queue is to implement and manages if there was a lop removing an item from the queue would be as easy as updating the as in as truncating a is there no such understand a bit about file systems and see any particular reason this would be it looks to me like all it would require is another word per allocation entry to say where the file starts within the with 1 terabyte drives under it seems like a pretty small price to pay for such other tasks would be made easier if you could lop off the front of a file as efficiently as you can truncate at the you think of any technical reason this function be added to a modern file file at

 process has its own memory it makes it more difficult to share but also makes the program safer need for explicit that being processes can share the same memory in thread is cheaper to create or but the main difference is that it shares memory with other threads in the same this is sometimes and in addition crashing the process would kill all advantage of using multiple processes over multiple threads is that it would be easier to scale your program to work with multiple machines that communicate via network you could potentially run 16 processes on 8 but would not have a benefit from more than 4 threads on a if the amount of information you need to communicate is multiprocessing may make more for the i would say that suggests if you follow mvc your gui should not also contain the model with you can then communicate to a work manager that can report what data is already

 processes are using the same each process gets its own private copy of that static all you need to do is make the list be a global variable in a and link to that dll from every that there is no need to pass anything additional idea of trapping the destruction of the list is fraught with due to the unpredictability of the order of destruction of objects in a would be a lot simpler to dump out the contents of the list at the end of your or not using a smart pointer class in a consistent then do it may be worth looking for cyclic reference counts object a has a count on object and vice this is a common cause of unreleased force all static destructors to run and release so you can then examine the entries in the list need to structure your application a certain you have a very minimal exe that launches the and loads a number of other dlls that actually do all the these other dlls are loaded with somehow by com or a the loadlibrary api works by either loading the dll into the or else incrementing an internal reference counter on the dll if it is already the freelibrary api decrements the counter until it reaches zero and then unloads the dll which point the static destructors for that dll will this we now add our diagnostic dll that holds a list of all outstanding reference counted all the other dlls use linkage to the diagnostic and the exe uses loadlibrary on it as is about to the exe goes through the list of dll handles it previously and calls freelibrary on all of by keeping the diagnostic dll it ensures still there at the the theory at in what order should the other dlls be if has static pointers to objects defined in then you better unload a so you need to have some idea of how your various dlls form a with higher layers depending on lower thus giving you a safe order in which to unload once unloaded all the any entries in the diagnostic list that refer to objects in the dlls will now be pointing to valid data on the but the vtable will be pointing at code that was defined by the dlls that have now been so you be able to call virtual functions on those you should be able to examine their data

 program does file loading and in the background while the screen is meant to be updated the idea is to have async loading of files the program will soon need so that they are ready to be used when the main thread needs the seem to happen in parallel with the main the main thread pauses during the loading and will often wait for all loads be up to 8 at to finish before the next iteration of the main main using so using for creating the worker thread keeps the list from being updated by the main uses waitforsingleobject is a list added to from the main while loadobj thread in a class that the main thread uses to the thread for loading a i used the commented code to see if main thread was ever but the print never so it looks like it never was waiting on the more notes based on function in the worker thread loads via win32 readfile function does this cause the main thread to reduced the worker thread priority to either and and that helps a but when i move the mouse around to see how slowly it moves while the worker thread is the mouse a bit lowering the it was much am running on a core 2 so i expect to see any mouse lag at code seem to be an issue since the never printed in my test code bumped the sleep up to but even 1000ms seem to help as far as the mouse lag being loaded is tiny 20k images they are they are small size since this is just test one single color in the so real data will be much is my thread not parallelized with the main	
 program is syntactically valid but it will produce undefined behaviour because you pass the address of a stack object to the heap typically this means that your program will crash when stack and the heap are two distinct areas of memory allocated to the process executing your the stack grows as you enter a function to hold its arguments and local and it shrinks automatically as you return from the the on the other is a separate address region where memory may be obtained on and must be released explicitly when it is no longer the address of a local variable is passed to it may attempt to free its memory and allocate it since the address is not from the and operates on the this will most likely will detect the address is not from the heap and abort the from the example program contains a few logical mystring declare a variable to hold a not a a string has type a pointer to the char is assigned the address zero which is conventionally assigned to invalid this compiles because the preprocessor replaces by the literal you store a zero byte in the which also by the terminator of a mentioned this is illegal because you pass the address of a stack object to the heap this problem remains in your second code you discard the return returns the address where the new memory was it may not be the same address as it may even be which is way of telling you it went out of is but the cast is is a more correct version of your allocate space one character terminator mystring some code using mystring omitted get more space mystring write to the string free the memory return it is better to avoid for you could use something like the some code using mystring mystring return	
 programmer culture seems to have a rampant infestation of invented where everyone appears to want to reinvent the wheel to say this applies to php but them doing this apparently far too of the time i believe its due to lack of and that combined with difficulty of hosting providers providing decent php makes getting a workable pear installation so much more and its worsened by design structure not being favorable to a modular this may improve with the addition of but have yet to see vast majority of php code i see in the wild is still classic amateur code interpolated with and the majority of cheap hosting that php users inevitably sign up for give you shell

 programming in using visual studio i often wish for code if like to achieve it by making my msbuild solution file call out to which would call ruby code for the code having the resulting generated files automatically appear in my one business example many possible examples i could where this kind of automatic code generation would be in a recent project i had an interface with some properties that contained dollar i wanted a second interface and a third interface that had the same properties as the first except they were with a business unit something like interface double totalrevenue double netprofit interface double consumertotalrevenue double consumernetprofit interface double corporatetotalrevenue double corporatenetprofit this there is a business and a business every property on iquarterlyresults becomes a property called on and likewise for make interfaces for rather than merely having an instance of iquarterlyresults for consumer and another instance for when working with the calculator object i was the user had to deal with of and it is much less confusing if he can deal with property names such as not get bogged down in this it is only an example and not the main main question is i love using ruby and erb for code and i love using rake to manage dependencies between to solve the problem what like to do is have msbuild call out to and have rake ruby read the list of properties on the interface and then generate the code to make all the dependent interfaces and their this would get triggered every time i do a because put it into the msbuild file for the anyone tried anything like how did it work out for what insights can you share about tips for have experience calling rake from msbuild for code gen and other how did it what are your thoughts

 quickly realized that doing this will create two variables inside the body class called x and two other variables in body called how is this even and why on earth does java even allow you are not creating two variables with the same obviously a compiler should not and would not allow you doing is shadowing the existing variables defined as and meaning that and are essentially overlapping the names for and making the latter two variable completely inaccessible from the body class to java language specification definition of shadowing is generally perceiving as a bad practice and a cause of and if you turn up the javac compiler the compiler will dutifully warn you about

 ran across some of these issues at work really have a chance to explore it there my issues should an application designer take into consideration when devising the error and exception handling ideal exception handling strategy would be a complete recovery and logging of the the if you could do such a you have written it in the code in the first as not really an per plus your implementation complexity goes the other side of this would be in the realm of autonomic systems and the i believe the most realistic strategy is to always try and force the system into a consistent state minimal you will always be forced to something loss or corrupted loss of resources resulting in reduced being in a consistent state increases your chance of staying operational at a diminished capacity rather than face a total formalizing a consistent state among the project team could mean establishing natural default values which would be used as a reset the strategy will differ depending on the software type business hosted web embedded is the software type think each type of software lends itself to different auditing and qos and it is reflected in the costs associated with downtime and or data the general strategy is the with the strategy is to minimize the appearance of the problem to the user and create you can achieve this by restarting the software quietly reset the with hosted web the session data from a crash can be dumped for later analysis and the user gets a new for a game for things like you invest in maintaining snapshot data to prevent gamers from losing progress in the event of a server server clustering and techniques are also very important in these political and legal is probably the most important part of error and exception which would come in the form of maintaining the end result of those issues is demonstrating the system failure any collateral damage is a result of an unpredictable chain of events which cannot be reasonably foreseen by the also important to demonstrate that whatever handling mechanisms in place had a positive effect by reducing keeping users in the loop in the face of a catastrophic failure is also important did my wow server but my main point is that transparency should be applied to disciplined auditing for the purposes of reconstructing the perspectives on error handling business a error handling should be totally if a server i still want my bank transaction to be completed as scheduled without having to call the bank and rerunning the a error handling is the most difficult part of the application to the number of things which can go resulting from both people and technology and how to classify them into cases which we can write code to handle is immensely we depend on the project budget and management to guide these but in the still like playing a game of russian business support i suppose error handling would be like the insurance paid during the software development phases which reduce the incidences of having to compensate customers who experience inconveniences or outages due to software also a measure of software quality and accountability they want to know which division group developer was

 random might be to and see if that texname1 is 0 after glgentextures you might not have an active opengl error checking i recommend writing a small function that prints readable output for the most common results from glgeterrors and use that to find the line that creates the another possibility would be to use something like or	
 random numbers in want an pseudo random number generator that can generate numbers with no repeats in a random there a better way to do it other than making the range of numbers and shuffling them or checking the generated list for i want it to be efficient in generating big numbers without the entire see everyone suggesting shuffle but if i want to generate large random number then that method would take alot more memory than if i just used a regular rng and inserted into a set until it was a specified is there no better mathematical algorithm for random number sequence with no	
 rarely write blocks most exceptions get thrown up to the top of the if i need a not sure particularly consistent between putting it inside the statement vs it really depends on whether you want the resource to be disposed before of after your exception handling code is asking about you should be writing statements any time you an object which implements directly or indirectly through and control its usually an object which uses an unmanaged resource like a file handle or network not always hugely but you learn through almost to do with io will be and windows handles fonts are

 rather than it should guide how you control and configure your if you have standard hardware and are often adding storing your built toolchain as images makes but the images have to be under version if you have 50 a configuration management system for your toolchain will cut if you have 5 it is more overhead another system to is git getting in the way of what you want to or are you getting requests because users are trying to say you should make your system more complicated because you your build tools are then the date of the build may be sufficient to determine the versions of the tools that were you can have your build script poll write a text file of your build tools and their similar to a dependencies you are using rapidly changing or versions of projects under active then there would be a good rationale for putting the build tools under version control but it would be solving the wrong why would you build with unstable	
 rather than trying to create two threads to draw to the you need to use the and make your model then you can have one thread that grabs the necessary info from the model each frame and throws it on and then two other one for the graphics and one for the which manage only the for you have a simulation class that has your 3d graphics and then a commandline class that has your command each of these classes does not use opengl at only manages the such as where things are in and in the case of the a queue of the lines then the opengl thread can query functions of these classes each to get the necessary so for it grabs the positions of the 3d draws them then grabs the lines to display on the command line and draws

 read before posting am aware of the multiply and add solution but since these are arbitrary length the multiply and add operations are not free so like to avoid if at all challenge is i want to be able to as a character pointer to a number in base 2 through 16 and as a second what base the number is in and then convert that to representation in base the integer can be of arbitrary my solution now does what the function but i was curious purely out of academic interest if a lookup table solution is have found that this is simple for and i can simply use a lookup table for each digit to get a series of for my problem is that i want to do this look up table method for odd like base i know that i could write the algorithm like atoi does and do a bunch of multiplies and but for this specific problem trying to see if i can do it with a look up definitely not so obvious with base i was curious if anyone had any clever way to figure out how to generate a generic look up table for base x base i know that for base you just give it one digit at a so the solution would likely have to lookup a group of digits at a ideas are greatly string to integer

 reading your question it sounds like your ui collects the information and then uses the factory to create the appropriate we use a different approach in the application i startup my applications uses the factory method to create a master list of of my labels have initialization parameters because they are variants of each for example we have three type of flat part while others have parameters that are user defined or not known at the first case the initialization is handled within the factory so i create three instances of flatpartlabel passing in the needed the second case label interface has a configure this is called by the label printer dialog to populate a setup in your case this is where the tracking reference and customtext would be passed label interface also returns a unique id for each label if i had a specific command to deal with that type of label then i would traverse the list of labels in my application find which one matches the cast it to the specific type of and then configure we do this when user want to print one label only for a specific flat this means you can be arbitrary complex in the parameters your labels need and not burden your factory with unessential

 reason for i find myself being asked to classes for classes in a commercial i am asked to test them against the boost makes absolutely no sense to i seldom see a license as there will be added functionality in the but classes are quite i really am am about to advise my employer against doing i wanted to do this in an informed only asked me for a few remaking boost seems be the but some selective parts of i see no 2 meetings i think i know what the only work as a freelancer so i am not briefed in every is really a mixture of distrust towards externally and not of boost if you really project bloat and some bad experiences with not fully compliant for embedded that may be targeted in the want something they can fumble around without being i am aware that there may be some other libs out will surely be able to borrow some os but iacta let there be yet another xplatform utility class framework reinventing wheels is for all your some of them where quite on the i think that i will not choose one of them as have given to everybody who contributed to my thought is just great and free is there a	
 reason is that floating point numbers are not a real representation of the number that you save in the to bcd coded can see the definition point the problem is that certain numbers are not expressable with a given set of could if you could add bits trick is that in most cases the difference between the saved number and the intended number are pretty in you have some corner cases where this may lead to is for example the reason why you should not build a financial software and use floating point numbers for money you can easily have differences that are which your tax office to compare floating point numbers you should always apply some kind of threshhold that is ok for your something as david mentioned in his you will still get into trouble with things like you can at least store numbers without loss in precision that you put into the as computers have limited memory you can always construct corner cases where you rely on exact saw your edit of the so here is the next somehow because you know whether just the number representation that is wrong or if just a real value that is close to it really depends on the requirements for your if a small error is then not then you have to use another variable type that is not suffering from the

 reason that you simply use a grid or dock panel with the textblocks in to control the alignment is because the default template of expander left aligns the header content instead of allowing it to are two ways around you can either specify a width for the content of the header or you can define a new template for the second option is probably the but it is also the harder one to if you have expression blend then you can right click the expander element in the and tree and select control parts edit a once you have done that you will need to modify the template as well can select this time though instead of creating a once your in there you can pretty much just set it to for horizontal alignment and add a bit of margin to the right and your you have expression blend update the question to specify that and i will post some sample the main reason i done that here is that the template is about 250 lines of code and i want to generate alot of noise for no the reply that you gave i am guessing you have if you put the following xaml into xaml pad you should see an example of an expander which will enable the header content to span the full width of the you will most likely want to move the resources for the page into a seperate resource dictionary so you can reuse it throught the l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l as an alternative you could use a dock as shown by the following some	
 reason you cannot safely call on instance of is due to lack of the public property provides unrestricted access to part of the internal as this part of the internal state must obey the rules of the idisposable it is important to make sure that is well problem is similar to allowing access to an instance used for if you do it becomes much harder to determine where locks are you can avoid exposing your disposable instance the problem of who will handle the call to goes away as	
 reasons explain i would just treat the interesting event as being whether or not the or part of a has arrived to your a thread reading data from each as probably thread that does the message the client threads signal to the message collation thread the very first part of a new message when a message is complete from a client that it passes the actual message to the collation if your collation thread had the initial signal that the part of a message has just treat that as client ready to send a want to set a timeout on the sockets as another poster has although with this threading i think it really depends on what policy you want to other suggestion of asking the client is sort of but probably not the solution you really you open another channel to the client to ask you just sent some but if the client and you got then in general something has just gone wrong and not clear whether that knowledge will help you or it might say and then just at that moment send and will the other channel to the client if the client says sent how do you know whether just about to arrive or has and will never	
 reasons why i do not want to accept the connection in order to check the remote ip the client would see that there is a listening socket on this if i decide to reject the client i would not want them to know that there is a socket listening on this this technique is not as efficient and requires more and network so it is not good in case of a denial of service

 recently going with their open company however after reading through i am not sure if this model is really way i understand is that they open up the source and depending on how much the contribute get badges at and are compensated accordingly from the revenue here are the releasing the source will be made a so that users can study and modify application for their own they want to contribute their they can submit them for to discourage a tiny essential core containing licensing will be kept least until users reach a this will gradually followed by a similar opening of rest of the company bug building the trust basic infrastructure will be up so that participants can rating each the algorithms code will be released as open so that they can be studied discussed used by will probably need quite some time tweaking before we reach a compensating income in the company operating will be through the trust metric distributed to company still keeps some bits private to retain control and that make it truly how is that any different from hiring developers and compensating them with stock options and david brown points out the the addition of the extra means that the license can no longer termed an open source it ideal for the open it essentially an issue of mutual if i fully respect your will in return respect my right to a and open source model really

 recently ran into an embarrassing situation with some flash coding where i had to accidentally sent clients a build where not all my debugging flags and variables were was sending requests to the debug instead of release of this was poor code organization on my resolved flash seem to allow one to set different build and the actionscript compile settings hosts a variety of switches arranged in such a fashion that forgetting to something i forgot to disable debugger might just as it did with in any i find that manually jumping between my release config and debug config to be easy to screw other what techniques do you use to jumping between your testing and the build config that you issue to your know i should probably slow down but i would much prefer setting up something to where i could just flip a just jumping back into flash after a long hiatus mx a bit of and aware of the futility of disabling debug support and setting import passwords and all my goal is to simply keep the script kiddies out of my decompilers trump all that configurations with flash

 recently read the excellent article transactional memory garbage collection by dan one sentence really caught my garbage collection improve performance by spatial locality but in practice pay a moderate performance cost software engineering my feeling had always been very vague about over and you see claims that gc be more so i always kept that notion in the back of my after reading i started having serious an experiment to measure the impact on gc some people took some java traced the and then replaced garbage collection with explicit memory according to review of the on the they found out that gc was always virtual memory issues made gc look even since the collector regularly touches way more memory pages than the program itself at that and therefore causes a lot of is all experimental to has and in particular in the context of performed a comprehensive benchmark of gc performance when comparing to explicit memory interesting would be to compare how various big for perform with or without has anybody heard of such results and focus on the performance not on why gc exists or why it is in case already pulling out the i am not trying to disqualify just trying to get a definitive answer to the performance hard data on gc vs explicit memory management

 recently started to to learn irricht 3d i already went through all the tutorials and feeling ready to build a simple game upon so here is some have irricht a 3d engine that is based upon the scene graph model it knows how to load meshes textures and show them it provides me structured classes to handle input from the user it provide me easy way to build a it provide me easy ways to define camers lights fogs etc and provide me more convenient ways to do more naturally what the engine provide is a way to define the entities in the game and the relations between example if a ball hit the wall i want the wall to be broken into several ok this is my job to lay down an infrastructure that will represent the game so lets say i already did it and i have some data model that abstract objects and how they relate to each other am talking about logic relations and not spatial that handle all the logic and represents all entities in the here is my is the best way to connect my data model to the this is not a techincal question but rather a design points to keep in data model built upon it aware of is accessible through something in the data i want to build scene graph again but the appropriate data model is mainly a of of entities that with each other in am thinking about the mvc pattern but i would like to hear more opinions from anyone who has some experience with making is the best way to build a game upon an exisiting	
 recently switched to netbeans from and the one thing that i liked about eclipse like to get in order of the tabs at the top of the source editor in eclipse seems to be related to most recently so if i have a group of 5 files working on at one they are all likely to be visible in the tab no matter how many tabs i have this the case i know what the order but it useful for switching between my active files quickly its usually faster to the file to switch to the correct tab than to actually use the tab there an option setting or a plugin that can change this behavior to something more like editor tab order in netbeans

 seen several here about the best way to handle and persist values data suited for to persist an enum using and like to ask what the general consenus tried to summarize my marking this community wiki in the hope of getting a sort of expert consensus so here it the the enums should be handled using either the native enum type least in java and or using something like the enum using plain constants or is as you lose type safety make it hard to understand which values are legal input for a choice between these two depends on how much additional functionality is to be attached to the you want to put loads of functionality into the enum is because you avoid on it all the a class is usually more the other for simple the enum is usually at least in java an enum cannot inherit from another so if you have several enums with similar behavior which like to put into a you cannot use persist each enum value should be assigned a unique this can be either an or a short a short string is since it can be mnemonic it easier for dbas to understand the raw data in the the every enum should then have mapping functions to convert between the enum use inside the and the id value some frameworks have limited suppport for doing this you have to put it into the enum database should contain a table for each enum listing the legal one column would be the which is the additional columns might make sense for a all table columns that will contain values from that enum can then use this as a this guarantees that incorrect enum values can never be and allows the db to on its problem with this approach is that the list of legal enum values exists in two places and this is hard to avoid and therefore often considered but there are two keep the list of values in the generate the enum type at build but means that a db connection is required for a build to which seems the list of values in the code to be check against the values in the db at runtime at on practices for using and persisting

 serialization hessian is one of the most is about times smaller and faster than java even using externalizable serialization you you can use compression fairly easily to make the data more that you can write your own i wrote a serializer which writes bytebuffer which is about twice as fast and half the size of hessian 5x than java this may be too much effort for little gain if existing serializations will do what you however it is as customizable as you like

 short and simple answer if you adjust the base testclass no way you can modify the class to replace a method by once we started doing stuff like be in a completely different kind of like longer answer it depends on who is calling the replaced other see if you implement a in between them and the unmodifiable concrete whether this is doable depends on whether that class implements or is its own the class then your only option is to decompile and modify the at design time using equivalent or at runtime using have to be hurting pretty badly to go this as sure to be painful and you still explained what you are trying do and replacing methods on the go is powerful stuff in the languages that permit it there might be mocking libraries that can be twisted sufficiently far to do the reflection but then be skating on thin

 short answer is that will remove a file from the will remove a module from the cache of previously loaded modules that the current python interpreter is when you import a the interpreter checks to see if there is a file of the same name as the file you are trying to if there and if the file has not changed since the file has been then python will load the file is significantly the file does not or the file has been changed since the file was then the file is loaded and a new file is is worth noting that simply running a python say will cause a to be only modules causes this to is another matter in order to speed up code which imports the same module python maintains a list of the modules that have been imported during the current interpreter if the module being imported is in then the cached version will be read nor files will be checked for on the python provides a builtin function which allows you to bypass the module cache and force a reload from get more information on module see the docs on	
 short answer is used subversion for a relatively large game development i will say it handled binaries surprisingly the downside is for now you will only get text information for texture to fit updated main character but even this little bit of information can save you when looking for performance issues and simply making sure that every one is using the same binary files for as far as i would require the full

 side the word is usually used to describe the parts of the string that are delimiter is used to describe the thing that separates the so to make your code more clear you should rename token to delimiter and rename dest to in your function and are several differences between your function and your function does is simply remove the token only call your function once to process all parts of the with strtok you call it multiple times for each part of the string times with null as the first also destroys the source whereas your code uses its own buffer think better to use your own buffer as you stores the position of the next token after each call where the first parameter is this position is then used for subsequent this is not thread safe though and your function would be thread can use multiple different whereas your code uses just being i will give suggestions for how to make a better not a function that is closer to to improve your function emulate think it would be better to make the following your function simply return the out of your loop when you have or a pointer to the first character of your source string that contains the next this pointer can be used for subsequent

 simply find nant easier to i dare say this is partly due to my background in but i found building a nant file for protocol buffers to be a simpler job than building an msbuild file for now there are things in the miscutil build which like to include but it seems ridiculously hard to dump the output of a task to a text the concepts are and there seem to be fewer gotchas in terms of when file collections are evaluated currently like using a setup which i previously thought was really silly i use nant for my build but invoke msbuild to do the actual my the idea of having two build systems for the same project is but i basically treat the msbuild part as a full build system just an easy way of and i never need to manually examine the project only interact with it via visual been able to evolve my protocol buffers build very easily this and i doubt have had the same experience if used going to try building it all with mono is released until then there are showstoppers in at which point see how portable the strategy

 since a ms access you will need to setup a file server on the remote i guess you have already done since you have already odbc installed on your mac am assuming you have mac os x or you need a driver to open the ms access you can find one check this out it has some interesting stuff about odbc on mac you are ready to you can use directly in or you can try some pure wrappers like i would definitely recommend to stick with the native odbc api to avoid headaches related to bugs on open source or unsupported wrappers you might find on the	
 since almost any language framework runs as normal code for the simply providing structure for applications you they can coexist well with other frameworks for the same or other you can certainly run rails and a java framework on the same machine you could even run rails on jruby and a java application sounds like just getting started i would recommend learning some of the basics for if you want to learn try the write some simple then move on to a ruby web framework like sinatra or have a better understanding of the difference between a language and how each is installed and run on your

 since event driven frameworks are similar to the reactor which stipulates a main loop which waits for events and then invokes the registered callbacks for the various is how frameworks have been traditionally a nice description about how erlang processes are tied to the event processes are tightly integrated with the erlang network io processes can sockets and send and receive messages this provides the elegance of programming plus the scalability of io erlang vm uses under the some interesting notes that were very influential on me at the note in particular how locks and callbacks interact	
 since in radians probably beneficial to define your angle as angle 60 functions themselves are working the rounding will only affect your answer if your distance is sufficiently small other than the answers should come out just the rounding worried remember that by does and you may distance distance in the question you want x and angle i assume not relating that to the point because completely distance formula distance

 since the question was edited enough to indicate a already in i also have another the last few versions of the has been having various bugs related to the port starting with being in use though not in use before you start maven and had this on and i also believe i have experienced this with version on i am currently running version fine on both ubuntu and i have not tried the latest version but you should consider juggling the version of the a few versions to see if the problem goes you only need to change versoion of the of the time this happens because of some configuration error in the plugin part of your try reverting to something quite similar to the samples on the documentation i also believe this has happened with some older versions of the so make sure using something

 single language and tool you learn makes you a better	
 single time you program in a language you allow the compiler to do work for and over time you come to rely on things that you have little or no knowledge of the inner workings a managed language like c or you have to spend time thinking about where a pointer will point to at the end of a whether to pass by reference or return a and other things that make you think about the code writing in a far more objective thing the ability to know things like whether using a vector or an arraylist in java is the right way to go can never be learnt until you understand the fundamental concepts behind many of the data structures you use on a learning to use c or will make you a better but whether you choose to take this knowledge and use it to make you a better is your

 so i suck at sql and i always have to ask for not sure what my disconnect is because i have any problem with programming c like here is my have a table full of tracking data for as specific course number i have added new tracking data for course number row of data is for one user for one so for users assigned to both course 6 and course 11 there are two rows of client wants all users who have completed course number 6 any time after august 1st 2008 to also have completion marked for course however i just convert the 6 to 11 because they want to preserve their old data for course for every row that has a course number of is marked as and is greater than the date august 1st i want to write the completion data over the row that contains the tracking for course 11 for that specific would need to carry over the data from the course 6 row to the course 11 row so things like user score and date of posted completion is moved is the structure of the values will be null and obviously be carried over as that is already in the right data from one existing row to another existing row in

 so much an answer as a clarification of the i think your factory is complicating things somewhat that you get a stack overflow exception versus not being able to compile at problem is a circular you cannot instantiate a without an instance of and you cannot instantiate an instance of b without an instance of class company private iclient ok so first build a client and pass it public class client private icompany ok so first build a company and pass it i public has an article about this which may be of some your class design is the problem and it needs the factory is just confusing the issue

 so the between returning a copy and returning the reference returning the reference may or may not be it depends on how is implemented by your compiler implementation others have pointed but even if you return the reference the assignment after the function call usually involves a as in name returning the reference may or may not cause problems if the users of your function know what they are storing the reference as reference and using it after the providing object goes out of scope then a you want it and use your object can internally store the string as and return a that there will be no copying of the object going and and always safe your users pull out the raw pointer with and do stuff with it after your object goes out of

 solution has its use think the first solution is good if trying to define a relationship as a simple especially if you need to use the key as a lookup second solution feels the most robust to me in and probably use it if i need a fast lookup so you to depend on anyone to know that the key is the id of the object comes is better for passing the instead of two and you just pass is a rare but key values may not be valid as for i to map string to but since a valid variable name i had the second easily in case along the line you need to more data to some i know about your but this is third would be good if you need fast lookup time some of the advantages listed above the data if you need the fast lookup a lot more either you run the risk of error if the id in the object somehow varies from the id in

 solution that seen work for something like this we were connecting to a sql server database in but having used the mysql connector i believe they work mostly the what we had was a single location where the connection was created and in that one we wrap the sqlexception for in a special the database is then in the exception you can just check for your special exception and and do whatever you need to do when the database is idea here is to not have to write a bunch of extra code that checks to make sure the database is there and working correctly before you make every but to ensure that when something bad happens you know that the database is the culprit and can handle that

 specific choice of threading model should be driven by the nature of the problem you are trying to there necessarily a single approach to designing the threading model for such an if we adopt the following arrive are independent and rely too heavily on shared is desirable to respond to an arriving message as quickly as want the app to scale well across processing architectures is the key design requirement more message at a faster to thread failure long operations is my the most effective threading architecture would be to employ a thread all messages arrive on a single multiple threads wait on the queue and process messages as they a thread pool implementation can model all three examples you single thread processes all messages thread pool with only one thread per n message types thread pool with n each thread peeks at the queue to find appropriate message multiple threads for all messages thread pool with multiple benefits of this design is that you can scale the number of threads in the thread in proportion to the processing environment or the message the number of threads can even scale at runtime to adapt to the realtime message load being are many good thread pooling libraries available for most including to your second whether to use standard windows message dispatch this mechanism comes with significant overhead and is really only intended for pumping messages through an windows ui unless this is the problem you are trying to i would advise against using it as a general message dispatching windows messages carry very little data it is not an each windows message has a and a this may not be enough to base a clean messaging model the windows message queue is not design to handle cases like queue thread or message these are cases that often arise in implementing a decent message queing

 specify the it specifies the in time required as the underlying data gets the constants are dropped from the what this means is that can be less than for some really small web service is a way to connect to some besides the network the real time is bound by what the service is actually there could be a database underneath for if it is something that just returns an the computational time is mostly the request is bounded by the database needs to parse the build a query optimized then apply some search algorithms against a series of caches and if you just plopped an integer into a trivial or a tableless sql then fetching the data is probably its the whole transactional packaging that will eat you get a packet back and forth to a server before you can parse trivial sql and punch back a tabled these days i say it was a toss some networks are faster than while some databases and servers are pretty nothing is is a web service faster than a if and only if the service is trivial hiding a then obviously just additional databases are big bulky and while gotten much faster over the their base level of transactional integrity specifies an awful lot of minimum cpu slower because they are doing so much more contrast that with some explicit minimal computation hidden behind network a fibber or gigabit network can rapidly move just so much less work to get course the reason we replace databases with custom written web services is it takes too long to write and then keep it up to way more effort than just slamming it into a database and accepting w

 spite of sql being a not full featured enough to do without each server software implementing the translation from mysql to postgresql is not unless your schema is automated translation scripts will only get you so very best approach would be to hand translate the and then write your own transfer scripts for the data you should also write verification scripts to make sure the schema and data come over a if your database is important enough to migrate then important enough to spend some time on in the end you would spend at least as much time figuring out the quirks and subtle messes than an automated migration script would cause as in the time to migrate the data but doing it yourself you have the chance to take advantage of features in postgresql that present in as well as the chance to make the kinds of improvements that only come from having the chance to do something a second the bullet and do	
 split the modules necessarily need to have the same dependencies as the others just necessary to do if you break things up you can have libraries without cyclic the issue with using multiple libraries is that by swig declares its runtime code and as a as problems passing objects from one module to you need to enable a shared version of the swig runtime the documentation web page documentation link is runtime functions are private each that the runtime functions are with linkage and are only to the wrapper functions in that the only problem this approach is that when more one swig module is used in the those modules often to share type this especially true for programs swig must collect and information about relationships that cross out that section in your downloaded documentation the swig runtime and give you details on how to enable this so that objects can be properly handled when passed from one module to the not worked with python but have done tcl

 standard or data structure has very good running times for single threaded however what is under i that it is totally valid even without locking or any atomic operations aside from atomic pointer sized anyone see any problems with the following i will assume that pointer sized writes are from not hard to argue that you can safely run the function in several threads as the only updates that will occur are all sets to the same if you allow the function to return the answer that was true when it was called opposed to when it not hard to argue that many and a single can be run at the same the argument for the change and the only updates roots and the never update for the remaining case i think that works as well but not so sure of not requiring that the solution be just as efficient as the single threaded order to avoid also willing to discard globally coherent taking another the cases work because if the side that is not the new root is unioned with something else not as a then you could cut it off of other side of the second union union union 2 aliases union y union b union can be sidestepped with a a the normal algorithm thread safe without any extra

 start with seeing as the simplest as that can be repeatedly called without but when called will return a value and then suspend their when called they will start up from where they last suspended execution and do their thing generator is essentially a cut down the difference between a coroutine and generator is that a coroutine can accept arguments after been initially whereas a generator a bit difficult to some up with a trivial example of where use but my best take this python code as an while do some funky yield do some more funky the coroutine does some funky stuff to and returns a new x print example of where coroutines are used is lexers and without coroutines in the language or emulated lexing and parsing code needs to be mixed together even though really two separate but using a you can separate out the lexing and parsing going to brush over the difference between symmetric and asymmetric suffice it to say that you can convert from one to the and asymmetric are the most like the easier to i was outlining how one might implement asymmetric coroutines in are actually quite simple all they are functions representing another point in the program if you call will cause execution to automatically switch to the point that function you use very restricted versions of them every day without even realising for can be thought of as a kind of give you a python based pseudocode example of a python had a function called and this function took two the first being a and the second being a list of arguments to call it the only restriction on that function would be that the last argument it takes will be a function will be our current would happen is that would in turn call with the current continuation that a reference to the point in the program at which was when calls the current essentially the same as telling to return with the value calling the current continuation and when it does it rolls back the stack to where the current continuation was when you called result of all of this would be that our hypothetical python variant would print hope that and sure my explanation can be improved on quite a

 string in question would be the description field of a and the max length should be something that of users should never run seems like probably too a column in a sql table even the appropriate place for it feel right for storing such a large value in a field like but maybe sure it but most likely going to use using the vs express database explorer to create the telling me that 4000 is the max size for nvarchar seem to have varchar listed as an is this just a limitation of sqlce and an indication that have to look into something true that this is a limitation of sqlce does anyone have another for a pet have to be something free and preferably easy to setup both for me and the but more important that easy to setup for the the database will be and performance too much of a is the best way to persist large strings in a

 structured exception handling is has a when an exception windows first looks for a handler for the exception by following the registered exception handler chain head of which is stored in on the first dword in the segment pointed to by the fs segment register all that ugly logic go away in it just became less search is done by calling a function with a particular a pointer to which is stored in each exception frame on the points to the topmost each frame points to the previous the last frame on the list is one that has been provided by the os handler will pop up a dialog if an unhandled exception reaches functions normally check the type of the and return a code to indicate what to one of the codes that can be returned is this exception and if windows sees it will reset the instruction pointer to the point of the exception and resume another code indicates that this exception frame should handle the given a third code is not going to catch this keep windows keeps on calling these exception filter functions until it finds one that handles the exception one way or the windows finds one that handles the exception by catching then it will proceed to unwind the stack back to that which consists of calling all the functions only passing in a different at this point that the functions execute the up until the handler which executes the with the stack page guard the process is none of the exception handlers will elect to handle this because otherwise the stack growth mechanism would the filter search filters all the way through to the base exception handler provided by the which grows the stack allocation by committing the appropriate and then returns the appropriate return code to indicate that the os should continue where it left rather than unwind the tool and debugging infrastructure are designed to let these particular exceptions play out so you need to worry about handling can read more about seh in excellent article in msj from over a decade

 submitted the question a couple of days but by continued research and after reading i think i have found an interesting white paper that i found very informative and comparison of the top four roger methodologies have come and gone in the last 20 at this perhaps 90 percent of the field use one of these four zachman framework for enterprise as a is actually more accurately defined as a taxonomy open group architectural framework called a is actually more accurately defined as a process federal enterprise be viewed as either an implemented enterprise architecture or a proscriptive methodology for creating an enterprise architecture gartner be best described as an enterprise architectural practice white paper discusses these four approaches to enterprise it does so within the context of a fictional company that is facing some very nonfictional operations these problems systems that have become unmanageably complex and increasingly costly to systems that are hindering the ability to respond to and market conditions in a timely and information that is consistently just plain culture of distrust between the business and technology sides of the white paper helped me in several gave me a good introduction and history of architecture architecture introduced me to what the author suggest is the 4 leading enterprise architectures then continues to compare them in a logical and simple manner with good examples that i could relate cannot say that all my questions have been answered and i am now ready to die but much has become clearer and thus i thought that someone else out there may also find this would still value any additional suggestions and questions you may have on this

 suggestion is that you should make a backup of the project then you should run the migration wizard of vs when it asks you if you want to see a report of all the files changed during select it will display a list of files that were changed during the almost all files changed are limited to the project files in which the version number is there is no hard and fast rule that nothing else will be changed and you should not be relying on the best is to check the changes in each file that is mentioned in the changed the only files changed were the project you should be easily able to maintain the code in vs just change back the version in the project files when you need to

 suspect a risk of premature optimization be careful about your your approach is a property of right angle is that what you actually assuming your points are and so for the general case you have them implicitly representing two vectors form the origin these v1 so your angle is where is vector this faster the will depend on a lot of do you know the vector or have to compute how fast can you do a dot product in your how fast is at some point tricks like table lookup might help but that will cost you all there really a general answer to your added like to that often playing is is a bit of a mugs game with modern cpus and compilers you know until you measure it and grovel the generated when you hit the point that you really care about it at this level for a piece of you can find out in detail what your system is but maybe a table is but maybe got fast vector computations and a small it all amounts to sorry on the other if you reached the point that you really care so much about this bit of you probably be thinking about it at this level at make it make it clean means abstraction as well as then worry about the

 suspect that this may be difficult or even impossible in suspicion is methods like user input loops and xmlhttprequests return control to the browser in order to and the browser get back control until every nesting level of function call has that means all your including the function that called would have to therefore is languages have features that allow you to effectively execute an asynchronous process as one that appears to the caller to be and similarly the are and javascript does not possess these so the best you can do is timeouts and a callback as an inline function to gain access to the enclosing variables in a closure does at least take some of the pain out of some other languages have to start wrapping every bit of enclosing state in an properties to achieve	
 suspect that your trigger is of of these generic generating triggers designed to log all changes for all table in one good in theory but difficult to maintain and use in you could run asynchronously would still require storing data somewhere for logging again then you are not auditing and neither do have history to you could look at the trigger execution plan and see what bit is taking the you change how you to per you could split the current log data into the relevant

 systems are this means that you trust the result of one operation to still be valid for the next even if the next line of you just say file exists and i have permissions for open the and you say file does not create the there is always the possibility that the result of your condition will in between the two parts of your the operations are not make matters the nature of the problem means that if tempted to make this odds are already worried or aware that something you control is likely to happen to the the nature of development environments make this event less likely to happen during your testing and very difficult to so not only do you have a but the bug show up while under normal circumstances the best course of action is to not even try to check if a file or directory put your development time into handling exceptions from the file you have to handle these exceptions so this is a much better use of your even though exceptions are checking the existence of a file requires an extra trip to and disk access is i even have a to this effect in another having some in for if really the methods be in the api in the first also consider scenarios where you your program to need to the create the first example that comes to mind is for a desktop this application installs a default file to home and the first time each user starts the application it copies this file to that application data it expects the file not to exist on that first when is it acceptable to check in advance for the existence other like size and of a is expecting failure rather than success on the first attempt a good enough rule of is it okay to check if a file

 team has a number of processes which we run manually but which may run for many the processes do various things to large numbers of entities database obviously from time to time there are failures and we have to design or processes to handle these failures gracefully and move on so the whole job is not brought on the particular process in the severity and urgency of failures in some cases we send emails when a rare but important error in other cases we just log it and move and so problem is that we have different error handling code scattered everywhere and more often than not when we it and move no one ever goes back and reads the so no one ever knows what problems we default to email for all problems because there would simply be too many are long running processes but not daemons where something like snmp or nagios might feel like a good surely this is a fairly common problem but i cannot seem to find many solutions heard people talking about using log4j other similar logging to log to a which seems like it might be a step in the right but surely there are more sophisticated solutions out there by imagining something where your logger writes events to a database and a web interface that lets you see what errors are happening with what processes in real time as well as configure email alerts for specific something like this if what approaches have you used to successfully deal with similar what worth most of our codebase is in python but i would imagine any decent implementations of this idea are largely and obviously any conceptual solutions would be as i just spent some time looking at which is kind of what i am looking but like it to be a webapp instead of a desktop and have alerting i just discovered and which are both somewhat along the lines of what i was though both target rails are the best practices for tracking in long running

 that particular post i was refering to shrinking the dictionary in order to be a more appropriate size for the number of the hood most hashtables are backed by a large array which usually points to another structure such as a linked the array starts out at an initialize when the number of elements added to the hashtable exceeds a certain threshold of the number of elements in the the hashtable will this usually involves creating a new array at twice the size and the values into the new of the problems features of a weak reference hashtable is that over time the elements are over time this can lead to a bit of wasted imagine that you added enough elements to go through this array doubling over time some of these were collected and now the remaining elements could fit into the previous array is not necessarily a bad thing but it is wasted compaction is the process where you essentially shrink the underlying data structure for the hashtable to be a more appropriate size for the

 the challenge here is because your application is meant to do a kind of task in a smart the very goal you hope to achieve is that the application becomes better than human beings at finding these and cool but if you pull it then it becomes very hard for any human beings to this the answer should be ideally the computer would i see why you think but consider these terabytes of information over have you read them based on i would argue that the answer should be if you really succeeded in your original the end user might sometimes that is a better you found a pattern that is going to make us save us or such a thing could never then why are you asking the computer to detect these kinds of patterns in the first the best thing i can think of is to let real life help you build up a list of test if there ever was a pattern discovered in the past that did turn out to be then make a that sees if your system discovers it when given similar i say in quotes because it may be more like an integration but you may still choose to use nunit or or rspec or whatever unit test tools some of these you might somehow try to the terabytes of data really mock the but at some higher level mock some of the conclusions reached from that for maybe you have a with some data in from which you expect a set of patterns to be if you can do it would be great if the system could its behind the patterns it this would let the business user deliberate over the question of whether the application was right or

 the example above probably indicates that something goes notimplementedexception itself is not wrong all about the contract of superclass and about subclass implementing this if your superclass has such this method is optional and may be not if not supported it should throw notimplementedexception to find out if it is supported or use void int not supporting this method is still ok with the if it is not you probably should disable corresponding action in so if you are ok with such then subclass implements it option when client explicitly declares that it does not use all class methods and is never going like this method never modifies it just iterates over them and gets elements by we decided to be not very bureaucratic and not define readonlylist and this is 3rd party library so you can not modify it void it is ok to pass there implementaion of list that does not support and other just document use with care this implementation does not implement entire list it does not support methods that modify the content of the readonlylistimpl implements having your code to define all your contract is as it your compiler to check if you violate the sometimes it is not reasonable and you have to resort to weakly defined like short words it comes to the if you really can safely use your subclass as taking into account that superclass is defined by its contract which is not only

 the longer a string and the more similar two strings the longer they will take to compare a string 1000 characters long where the only difference is the last you can see how long it will take before routine discovers the lets contrast that cost of comparing a long string to the cost of locating them on are stored in which are balanced trees with a variable number of the and where each node is linked to the other b this gives us two quick look up by walking the and then tree order access to other nodes you find easy to find then are laid out in disk and in general the more nodes you can cram in to a index then the lower the overall height of the index the lower the tree the faster you will be able to find a specific since you will typically traverse the height of the tree to get to any one leaf lower the the fewer disk hits you have to if you have a tree 4 then to reach any random node requires loading 4 index pages in to and 4 disk a 4 high tree is as assorted values of as a 8 high the more you can put in an index the fewer hits need if you start iterating along the if your nodes hold 10 key loading a hundred rows will cost you 10 index page whereas if it only holds 5 per you get twice the index disk that you get a geometric progression in terms of number of records you need to add a new layer to the the difference between a 5 key node and a 10 key node is not twice the the value of have small keys lots of fan out in your index with a still have to do hash and it really comes down to your data access how busy is the what kind of queries you how much ram you have to cache index index hit to locate your initial row may well not even be on the radar of your query key takeaway is that the number of records but the fan out of the index tree for if you have a 1k index and a 4 byte index you can get 250 nodes per index very simplistic and a 3 layer tree can 16m rows all within a 3 deep tree any of 16m rows within 3 disk

 the most applications with a safe type system just or allow the application to violate those overflows and many other exploits occur because the constraints in those languages and runtimes provide no checking and cannot guarantee the program do something like execute arbitrary code in safe systems verify the code to be free from those a side can still perform unsafe actions and set itself up to execute arbitrary just rather cumbersome and unlikely to be used in a real security holes you would see in a managed browser would be if it let arbitrary code be using the clr as a safe while the clr generated code the of your will be the loader and verifier themselves are usually written in a lower been a few think 2 for security holes where a maliciously formed assembly could force the actual clr to execute arbitrary these are relatively rare and the surface area is far less than be a fully managed browser itself fall prey to those specific but that also means have to have your plugins written and executed in a similar way there are other security holes that can be but usually they will be less severe than find with an unmanaged for would still remain an but at least you have a document can execute arbitary type

 the only makes sense in the context of its then it should be returned nested within its for in an element make sense as a sub resource on its if a resource can stand and you are going to want to manipulate a resource independent of any other then it should have its own that you can post or put to that resource without affecting other related and without having to parrot them back to the if you had to manipulate everything from the think about what happens if one person does a modifies one and then does a put of the whole thing with that what if someone else changed one of the others in the then you need to be adding locks and transactional which defeats the whole statelessness of get requests at it is likely to be a good idea to have some form of bulk query by which a client can get a large number of resources at having to do a new http request for each resource can take a long since it means a new round trip over the network for each it may make sense to have bulk update functionality as but if you are going to want to be able to manipulate one resource at a you need to provide a uri for that one perfectly fine to have more than one way to access you can think of it like a you can get stories on the main or on archive or by going to their if you want to to a bulk update without running into the problem of having one client give stale data to the you basically have two one client tells the server want a lock on this whole set of fetches the data it wants to modifies the sends it back to the and unlocks the client downloads the set of which is marked with some sort of revision tag which the server changes every time it gets new the client modifies and sends it back to the if any of the other data in the set has been modified in the the revision tag will be out of and the server will respond with a your data is out of try each have advantages and the problem with locking is that it is and so fit into a rest architecture very if the client program crashes or otherwise dies while it has the then that data will be permanently locked unless you have some kind of lock which can get locking can also lead to deadlock if the clients are doing some kind of fancy transactions that involve multiple problem with optimistic concurrency is that if there is a high load on a data with a lot of clients changing it at it can take many tries before a given client can post its in a slow client may end up being completely cut off from posting updates because other clients continually change the data in ways that mean that the slow clients changes always need to decide for yourself which of these options suit these issues also come up when changing a single resource update may clobber but when you aggregate resources into a bulk they are going to come up a lot more why i would recommend having two if going to aggregate one in which the resources can be accessed and an optional bulk interface where many resources can be read and written at

 the point where you are reaching a sufficient portion of your target audience that the cost becomes too great to make up for the additional little bit you gain by supporting a most is too much to drop for the little bit of work required to support ie5 is small and the compatibility issues large enough that it make sense to support running a site oriented to a technical audience you might be able to drop ie6 as very few of your target audience would be turned and the additional work to support them is greater than the value they represent to your screen resolution keep in mind that more and more users are experiencing the internet through mobile this is a question that you can only answer by looking at your and your and making a judgment the most big sites support a wide range of resolutions and devices but you may only need to support one once you look at your audience and

 the worry about bits on the wire but the overhead of reading and the tend to favor short names inside function and make function names as long as but as short as possible without loosing useful doubt it is a it depends on whether you want your code to resemble natural language or be more implicit and prefix variable names to inject context information into i if that is the ide should provide such injection capabilities as a visual overlay on the code via context next version of visual studio will make such annotation gymnastics much easier via a extensibility mechanism extended deep into the editor i have not used visual studio for editing javascript see now that your concern is indeed the space this should ever be an always always always favor readability over bits on the since compression as noted by the other only thing i would add is the which is that sometimes comprehension is made easier with compact names over excessively long but it is harder to get short names long names are much easier and faster to make right in my reason for short names should never be data compression only cognitive what works is

 the wpf grid control is easy when your child elements are always contained within a single grid cell there is no a fixed width column stays the requested fixed an auto column will indeed size itself to be as wide as the widest cell in the star columns share any remainder space according to their relative star all is simple in the once you have a cell that spans two or more columns the width of the columns becomes more complicated to calculate and indeed seems here is a trivial example of what i we can define two columns with the first as auto and the second as fixed at 30 we define a button that spans both of the columns and happens to measure at 80 pixels my machine with my font and theme settings need to allocate the 80 pixels width of the button across the two spanning given the second column is fixed at 30 i would expect 30 to be allocated against that column and the remaining 50 go to the first because the first column is auto it seems the obvious thing to if you try this in practice you will find that the first column is 0 pixels and the second column has become the full even though that second column is defined as fixed and so should not be growing it as stretched to the full width of the maybe i am missing something here but that does not seem very logical to to my actual is there a full description of the logic used by the grid control for doing this calculations so that i can fully understand how it i have searched msdn and google and find nothing that describes how spanning elements affect the column know the algorithm used to size grid columns with spanning

 there is an important semantic difference between the really semantic or both iterable they both work with a for difference is for example important when one wants to loop multiple does this ever come have to be more in the rare cases when you need to make two passes through an iterable there are often better say processing a you can iterate through a list all you why did you get tangled up with an iterator instead of the okay that reading a file in two and you need to know how to reset the in this a and is or a close and a that feels you can to get a list which allows two passes with no so not what if we have a file so big we read it all into for obscure we what down to the of two on the first we accumulated an index or a summary or an index has all the a is a restructuring of the with a small change from to preserved the data in the new in both we need the file we can use the index or the algorithms can be changed to one pass of the original iterator or iterable and a second pass of a different data is neither lybl or this is algorithm you need to reset an iterator an example of an simply a i in print i in print is trivially i in print i in print times in is trivially write an api that an and when someone refuses to read the api documentation or refuses to follow it after having read their stuff as it to safeguard against the case were a user provides only an iterator when multiple passes are are both examples of insane people writing code that breaks our simple someone is insane enough to read most not all of the api and provide an iterator when an iterable was you need to find this person and teach them how to read all the api documentation and follow the api issue very these crazy programmers are remarkably and in the few cases when it does know who they and can help have to read the same structure multiple algorithms are a fundamental not do element in element element in element element in element element consider something like element in for f in element most this kind of of your algorithms results in a program that might be easier to optimize and might be a net improvement in	
 there is no cost to the do when writing the is just as easy to write as so prefer the there is no cost to the other going back and making this change takes and it most likely make a noticeable so you probably bother with it can make a on probably but for complex the compiler is unlikely to be able to optimize it the reason for this is that the increment operation no is no longer an intrinsic built into the but a function defined in the the compiler may be able to optimize it like any other but it can in assume that can be used instead of the two functions may do entirely different when determining which optimizations can be done by the consider whether it has enough information to perform in this the compiler know that and perform the same modifications to the so it can not assume that one can be replaced with the but you have this so you can safely perform the of the others you mention can usually be done very efficiently by the can be done by the and usually better at it than all it needs to know is how large a proportion of the function consists of function call over and how often is it a big function that is called often probably be because you end up copying a lot of resulting in a larger and more instruction cache inlining is always a and the compiler is better at weighing all the factors than unrolling is a purely mechanic and the compiler can do that same goes for strength swapping inner and outer loops is because the compiler has to prove that the changed order of traversal affect the which is difficult to do so here is an optimization you should do even in the simple ones that the compiler is able to you sometimes have information your compiler if you know that a function is going to be called extremely even if only called from one it may be worth checking whether the compiler automatically inlines and do it manually if you may know more about a loop than the compiler as well that the number of iterations will always be a multiple of so you can safely unroll it 4 the compiler may not have this so if it were to inline the it would have to insert an epilog to ensure that the last few iterations get performed such optimizations can still be if you actually need the and you have information that the compiler outperform the compiler on purely mechanical but you may be able to make assumptions that the compiler and is when able to optimize better than the

 there is no memory the code in your second example is logically equivalent to the setter is logicall equivalent to foo worth noting that setting directly is probably not something you want to do outside of an init if you assign a value to you bypass the automatic kvo notification would have to wrap your assignment in a you break any behavior if it overrides the expecting all modifications of to go through the assign directly to in an init method because the method or a overriden method may have or depend on the fully you would use rather than in the method for the same

 thing that often helps is to use a lightweight memory if you combine this with allocation methods any until all done with the you can get something ridiculously did this for an embedded system mostly for performance but it saved a lot of memory as trick was basically to allocate a big block slightly bigger than need could allocate a chain of blocks if you and just keep returning a pointer it up by rounded up to maximum align requirement of 4 in our each this cut our overhead per alloc from on the order of bytes down to 3 we also ignored calls until we were all done parsing and then freed the whole clever enough with your frame allocation you can save a lot of space and it might not get you all the way to your but it would be worth looking at how much space overhead you really my experience with systems is that they use tons of small each with a relatively high you have virtual a large might not even hurt that if your access at any given time is local to a page or three you have to keep the memory you actually need in the long but the becomes a lot more efficient this

 thing to reading between the instead of calling for tasks to be implement a which prints out the environment before calling the external so that you recreate one of the tasks with an command from the command show the environment in which an external command print map print return	
 thing to remember about gae is that it works differently than a standard python install and apps you have may not work well at in that the biggest difference is the while there are advantages to the database available with you need to treat it differently and there are many things that your code may be expecting your database to be able to do that it you are starting from scratch on an either platform would work if you have an existing python getting it to work on gae will take considerable	
 thing we have done where the error page is very is to simply intervene in the a base and emit the html via the somewhat but gets you the desired result in a centralized	
 thing yet to be considered is versions of visualstudio prior to 2005 did not allow exe assembly projects to be referenced from other so if you are working on a legacy project in your options would unit tests in the same project and use conditional compilation to exclude them from release everything to dll assemblies so your exe is just an entry the ide by hacking the project file in a text the three conditional compilation is the least error

 things leap out about the original batch neither is going to help in the long your benchmark be sure to capture the start time the and the end time the your sample do evaluates to something like and the command subtract you need a command that produces a simple scalar time was going to say it be but the batch language is a lot more powerful than it is given credit so here is a simple implementation of for the pax beat me to an answer showing the string splitting while i was fiddling and johannes suggested moving the arithmetic outside of the measured remeber start note that we look at the so calculation work right if the program run spans local do something but probably with more care about odd things will happen if any arguments contain precent signs or carets and there may be no way to prevent capture the end time before doing anything make t0 into a scaler in 100ths of a being careful not to let misinterpret 08 and 09 as starttime 360000 6000 100 make t into a scaler in 100ths of a endtime 360000 6000 100 runtime in 100ths is now just end runtime runtime started at ran for could simplify the arithmetic and be a little more honest about the overall accuracy of this by not bothering with the 100ths of a second here it is in assuming you have a sleep command or some other time timer sleep took 3000 ms to i revised the code and its description as suggested in a think that when the nt team replaced with they thought they get away with making it very but in it is almost an entirely new many of the old favorite commands have new features if the extensions are of those is which prevents variables from modifying the another is which gives you a remarkable amount of the principle trick used here is the new substring extraction syntax where means the two characters starting at offset 3 in the value of the variable named a real take a look at the full description of set at a and if that scare look at and notice that it can parse text out of fixed of time fields containing or reported by frankie in tweaked a couple of and added some that there is a glaring oversight here that probably not going to it work if the command starts on a different day than it that it will do some math related to the time of day and report a but the difference mean it to at least warn about this case is fixing it to do the right thing is fixed error where the is not set properly for single digit this is due to returning notice the using replaces the space with a leading zero and will be set this error only occurred when a script ran from one single digit hour to the

 think a good idea to use dataavailable for this the end of your response is whatever your protocol says it better to use blocking calls like read to read your and use whatever protocol established to determine to read and how it might be that not all data you want is because read return when all your data is but when some data is so you need to check on how much was your protocol is likely want to respond to every single byte as with a terminal you want to echo it or process commands or what is perhaps suited to check if a read would block when called will return with whatever is in the but it makes your loop less van den	
 think a pain vs pleasure not to put code in a python config file because all valid but it does mean you could confuse a user who comes in to reconfigure an if that worried about rope it off with comments explaining roughly what it does and that the user edit rather edit the for your nigh on for developers to test then deploy their definitely more pleasure than but you should really do this from import in your if nothing but to make it clear what that file what doing there splits overrides into two

 think part of the idea of oo programming is that classes and logic is separated so it would probably be better to split each class up into a separate as for when to create a new method in a class or a new i think if the method you use has to do with the main operations of that specific class it should be only make a new class when it performs routine or important and keep the right logic in the right

 think that option is built into but with you could just use a simple help make this more declare the regex once perhaps at class level or make it static rather than recreating it all the odds are only using the returned array to iterate over the you can make this faster by skipping the call on the end and just keeping the ienumerable for your keysplitter new regex test key in of the nice things about how works is that this will still only iterate over your results because the method in the function will do lazy depending on what you need to do inside the for loop you might be able to gain a similar efficiency by adding a

 think that you see for every call in the stacktrace because your code is compiled in release mode instead of debug in debug your code will be compiled to include a debug symbols file when this file is your exception stacktrace will accurately represent the line any only the line number of your is significant because the rest are internal calls of the framework number after each stacktrace entry is apparently the offset into native i do confess that it originally appeared to me that it was the time of execution in ticks or

 think the ideal solution would be to have the data layer throw a specific exception in this perhaps a subclass of sqlexception for or something you want to be able to treat different exceptions then you have to throw different exception types to begin think this is an area where the spring framework gets things really they provide very rich hierarchy of all of which extend with of types for integrity etc this leaves your client code free to catch any of the exception types which it can handle or care exceptions that indicate an error that may not be repeatable if you the a fatal or you can simply catch the root

 think the most important thing with your backing beans is to seperate their if you have a front page for a cms system i would see it as bad practice to put every piece of code into one bean bean would turn very large easier for other people to find what their looking for if they are troubleshooting the login if they then can easily just look up the you have small pieces of functionality that is clearly distinct from the rest of your by separating this i would imagine you would make it easier on yourself to this code into something when you already have a nice bean with good 1 big to do it will make it more memory dependant you have to do declarations like this mybigbean bigbean new instead of using the funksjonality you actually needed by doing loginbean loginbean new me if im wrong my separating your beans is like separating your you dont want 1 big method which runs over of but rather split it up with new methods that handles their specific most likely someone other than you will have to work on your jsf projects for the i dont see it as a troublesome issue to allow your jsf pages access too the properties in objects in your this is support which is built into and really just makes it easier to read and build your allready separating the mvc logic by doing this your saving yourself tons of lines with getters and setters in your for example i have a really huge object given to me by the web where i need to use some properties in my if i were to make a for each property my bean would expand with atleast 100 more lines of variables and methods for getting the by using the built in jsf functionality my time and precious code lines are my 2 cents regarding this even with the question already marked as	
 think the problem is in the linear search it looks like you are just comparing the pointers to see if they strings are the work like all that does is check to see if the pointer addresses are the you need to use the function to check that the actual strings are the also recommend working on naming your variables a little more it makes things much easier to	
 think the question has more to do with the concepts involved than the answers to the and internalize keeping unrelated pieces separate its important to get real reuse on different related technologies help you on its you that separate the app in appropriate which you can appropriately reuse for different endpoint for communication based on known protocols allows implementing different pieces with different the operations flow like independent actions based on different gives you a lot of places where you can add is a particular of the overall process using lots of resources and the server take it just move to a separate load kept and that server taking it add an additional server and load you also have more opportunity to use caching and connection a critical that needs to be available all the add a server so you can have a fail have an overall process that needs to be all the use queues for pieces that can be processed you really need to support that type of set appropriate targets that relate to the specific if you really need to support that type of i recommend you get someone on board who has dealt with it is something for a load that might eventually identify the bounded contexts and design the interaction between those with a soa keeping the code clean is all you have to do for the use loose focused integration etc in your code with good if you later need to separate pieces of the it will be a lot	
 think there are five is as sandboxed as possible array access bound this eliminates things like c and but opens the possibility for and tools provide meaningful error that eliminates a some great languages have completely unreadable error which would mean you end up on the phone trying to figure it is possible to get obvious manifestations preferably and tools are preferably that has an interactive debugger within an you choose to go with one of the teaching that might be a good but they must be kiddie would suggest staying out of most scripting languages as they are not very intuitive to debug and to understand errors think java is a great especially as it comes with great free ides like it is possible to use it without having to know too much about it has an interactive and generally gives sensible error your father eventually chooses to head in the gui there are friendlier lightweight apis that are easier to learn and use than you were using a i would say might be a good choice as but as a mac i have the same issue with ms	
 think there are many gotchas to this approach over the usual problems of running a script from a compiled i find the biggest problems tend to be people from moving the sure people add hidden dependencies in the script that are not reflected in the calling i do think you should consider another model for your instead of having a program reference a why not add all of the logic into a compiled this can be easily linked into the program and exposed to powershell via a i find this is an easier way to maintain shared code between scripts in	
 think there is a simple way to wrap a mutable data structure as an immutable immutable data structures become efficient when the new version can share data with the old version in clever and i really see how this can be done without access to the internals of you really want a persistent priority queue might be those seems to have inserts so if that is an issue maybe you have to look for another on second a simple implementation of a persistent priority queue is just to store the in a sorted something like x pq pq the code above is pretty limited multiple for but it illustrates the

 think this has to be the most frustrating thing ever done in web yet one would think it would be the easiest of all things in the world to that is need 2 separate lists of radiobuttons on my one set allows a customer to select an the other set does also but for a different but only one set can have a selected tried this using 2 radiobuttonlists controls on the same got around the nasty bug with groupname assigns the uniqueid which prevents the groupname from ever working because 2 radiobuttonlists have the same groupname for all their radiobuttons because each radiobuttonlist has a different uniqueid thus the bug assigns the unique id as the name attribute when the buttons are since the name sets are they are not mutually so i created that custom radiobuttonlistcontrol and fixed that groupname when ended up happening is when i went to put 2 instances of my new custom radiobuttonlist control on my all was swell until i noticed that every time i checked for or not matter which i was the value always spit back and i was not able to figure out why onto the third try tonight and into the break of dawn i tried to instead just scrap trying to use 2 custom radiobuttonlists altogether because of that issue and try to spit out 2 sets of radiobuttonlists via using 2 repeaters and a standard input html tag got that ok but the 2 lists still are not mutually i can select a value in the first set of radiobuttons from repeater1 and same goes for i cannot for the life of me get the to be mutually exclusive sets of mutually exclusive radiobutton

 think using design patterns in names is a for example in one of my games i second two classes and subclass gamelevelabstract and implement pure virtual i can see in my source view that that class is abstract and immediately know it is or what looking example is my graphics the same setup as i had except that it deals with find using the design pattern in the name to be useful and informative when i am looking for a i do believe that some things should not be used in the name such as however factory or facade are examples of design names i think fit well in the name of a class that implements those think that if you use good class names that help the programmer get a good grasp of what your class does at a glance is a good think that stating something is a data structure or an algorithm is a good thing in most or add anything to the understanding of the class as is obvious in

 think what looking for is if return loader new you were mixing object literal notation with function which is	
 think what you are looking for you are using a similar structure definition like jaredpar is something like t new buffer new pin stuff with your new tpacket	
 think what you may be looking for are and a masterpage allows you to define a basic template that is by the implementing pages by having the implementing page add own content to the contentplaceholders defined on the a usercontrol is a piece of markup and associated code that you can reference from your mark up or add dynamically to the page being rendered in	
 think what you mean to ask does and casting work for and are asking about implicit casting which automatically coverts one object to another defined you will not be able to do this for an and because they are already defined in the framework and you are not able to reduce the scope of the by casting it to an but if you were using that as an example for actual objects that you created you can use the link to learn more about how this works and how to implement you can always use the convert method to convert them to the right int myproperty	
 think what you want is more like but directionally static void object value where t return t value t scooped by	
 think wrapping your statics and providing access via singletons at a minimum via static is generally a good since you can better control access and avoid some race condition and synchronization

 think you are having trouble with in ie your code seems to work without any removenode to work in both ie and ff you can write like objecttoremove object to parentnode objecttoremove objecttoremove this	
 think you are looking for like in that you specify the number of in but it require that you have a notion of the objects clustering like every cluster has a representative which is the member of the cluster closest to the you could think of it as a version of that finds instead of all you need is a distance metric to cluster and used this in some of my own work for exactly the same reasons you is not the fastest but there are fast variants that are probably good enough for your here are descriptions of the algorithms and links to the documentation for their implementations in is the basic implementation of is a much sampled version of it works by clustering randomly sampled subset of objects with pam and grouping the entire set of objects based on the you should still be able to get very good clusterings fast with you need more a that gives an overview of these and other	
 think you are looking for the it is not quite as awesome as so you have to give it a format mask to select your i think the mask would be depending on whether or not you are expecting month names and based on your example it could be select 30 2006 30 2006 row in set out the reference for the mask	
 think you are looking for the you have it you can just do something like words keywords x x is what element in the document you want to look if you want it to be done to the entire just put	
 think you are misunderstanding something about the way that arrays of primitives when you create the array abcd it does not contain the variables and it should contain copies of their when you sort you do not actually have any impact on or way to accomplish something close to what you are trying to do would be to use a sorted where each value would map into a value you can then iterate over the keys a sorted and assign a sequential number to each value you clarify more about what really trying to it may be easier to

 think you are searching for the wrong thing codes and keypress events will only capture as you already the user can enter letters in multiple which is all done through software 22 is a or 228 might be or and there is no way to tell what the user entered based just on the buttons they there is also built into most which will add characters the user did not press buttons searching for ways of capturing the actual text the user is

 think you could create a new table and insert into that table the data from the first into table2 select from table1 order by column1 drop table2 and rename	
 think you have to use some libraries like gwt because we learn more when we see how to use the code of other and doing some ui is far more motivating than writing console funier to manipulate checkbox than double not so much	
 think you may be looking for	
 think you may be thinking of cas in the wrong i just may have not come across this but from my cas something that going to use in your application to protect the application against cas is in place to protect the users system against malicious whether you like it or must request permission to perform certain tasks on the an example of this is the before reading or writing a the application has to ask if it can even do of this is just one example of many permissions in the applications that see are most affected by cas are those that are hosted online in some and are therefore less trustworthy than those hosted on your local this includes internet explorer hosted objects are a lot like and loaded from a network i this is to protect a users system from potentially malicious you have missed any opportunities this system provides while writing native in if like be cursing this system when it bites you in the that no this kind of security necessarily more important for managed in it would be from a stand point if unmanaged apps had to go through this sort of security i think what microsoft was trying to do with for what

 think you should never implement things you or are not sure you are going to need them or if it add value to your put it if you like to keep your tests in synch with your and use them to show use cases of your then you have anything that is not covered by those this includes problem i other than a possible waste of is that it would confuse someone who reads the does this class have equals is it some data can it be a part of a does it even make sense to compare instances of this say only implement these when you actually need therefore i say that i implement this and that perhaps would be the method that i write the because usefulness appears a lot in vajna

 think your algorithm cannot be optimal because it makes no use of any measure of you use other metrics like and checking for drive a wedge between yours and an optimal we need to exploit that gap by looking for shapes with close vertices which would decompose for example the i found this on the polygon which forms a g or u have no protection against the point being connected across the concave which is to the algorithm is also quite and may be overdoing it just like complex you may find bugs in it because complex code makes complex a more extensive initial stage to break the shape into simpler shapes like triangles and then an iterative or genetic algorithm to recombine you will need a stage like this to combine any unnecessary divisions between your convex polys and by then you may have limited your possible decompositions to only a guess something into generate a number of a quality metric of the best of the decompose each using and generate a new set of from 4 until some measure of convergence is	
 think your best answer comes from the user is there any of the customer and supplier information that is maintained in by the same users the same if easier for them if they can change information in one place for both if got them changing each which will not make anyone issues arise if you have separate purchasing and sales and need to interface to or have an enterprise system which case you should probably match what it are you deriving your requirements from use cases or user stories or	
 think your best bet would be to go with a that way you can install mono at your	
 think your issue has anything to do with the transactionscope it sounds like describing the expected behavior of sql server changing the isolation level only affects not from sql server a transaction isolation level does not affect the locks acquired to protect data a transaction always gets an exclusive lock on any data it and holds that lock until the transaction regardless of the isolation level set for that for read transaction isolation levels primarily define the level of protection from the effects of modifications made by other that means is that you can prevent the blocking behavior by changing the isolation level the issuing the the isolation level prevent to prevent blocking the you would use the isolation but you would have to account for the possibility that records may be retrieved that have been by an open transaction they might go away if the transaction rolls	
 think your second attempt is on the right except instead of you should try	
 think your stronger argument will be in i designed the intranet for the last major company i worked i created page templates that have valid markup and used conditional comments to target stylesheets for different versions of the site was launched 2 years it looks the same in firefox 2 safari 2 and ie no markup or style changes were this means that when the organization finally updates to ie the web developer team will not have to do big win in reduced maintenance

 thinking of where you bind a function and arguments together to be called usually currying is used so that you can add additional arguments at the time the function is actually than the a link to an the case mocked up in the question really is that you can pass a list of args as positional or a list of kwargs as named to another return return	
 thinking something to do with the condition rules that you use in your workflow but i remember the about how stored and accessed by the	
 thinking your grid is to be as small as possible column or you try with one more column and row with a size other have pointed you also need to remove the since they to try to set a background color on the so you see where it actually

 this about the possibility of someone malicious altering your code to do something you program it to or is it about the possibility of random errors messing up your in the latter you probably have to worry because the error rates on modern computers are something like 1 in less than one per processor per and if even that is intolerable you can use algorithms to reduce the effective error rate as close to zero as you want the cost of needing more time to do a given hackers worried really no expectation of security at someone in physical control of a computer in modify it to do absolutely anything that can conceivably be done by a they could disassemble your code and alter assembly instructions at if they to make your program behave however they want it we usually worry about this in because most of us writing anything worth the effort to those who programmers designing military encryption hardware or nuclear missile control can fall back on hardware which makes it extremely difficult to alter the stuff can be might want to take a look at a book called by ross which describes some of this and in general how people who need to secure their code can do

 this apply to my present sure all been there a java developer been asked to develop an app in or a developer asked to do something in or a php developer with the opportunity to do a rails or django if a competent these sorts of platform shifts really be a given enough you can expect to become as proficient as you were on your old if this is a freelance project for a does it seem at all unethical to be learning this platform on their assuming said client give you an unlimited amount of time to finish the there are going to be compromises and possible quality issues due to your you have to start somewhere and not everyone has the luxury of spare time to tinker with new sometimes its necessary to just bite the bullet try and plan things intelligently and just get it done and get this seem would accepting a lower rate make it more of billing for work done on a platform you just started

 this code is keep it this problem with storing the return value of a function in a reference is that you are not allocating the space to actually store the return so you often end up with a reference pointing to a temporary either the temporary return value of the function created by the or a local variable allocated during the function freed at its is true that you must not return a reference on a local variable because this variable will be freed when the function the standard states that the compiler must not free the temporary return value of a function if it is so if your function is returning a float by you can store this value in float the compiler ensures that the actual temporary value returned by the function will not be freed until you are done with your that this behaviour is only valid for references a look at this for more

 this is a major undertaking which will involve lots of my advise would be to treat it like a very long term a clear goal in which addresses major issues like maintainability and the future of your this has been agreed by the stake develop a prototype system to test your assumptions where you can try out vrs or mvc vrs would assign your best developers for start with one your small legacy and build the core components which you will in other this start with your more senior but everyone must get involved and be familiar with the new will ensure everyone is trained at the same and no one is left on how many applications you have i would rotate so all systems can all new work must be done in your language not in convert each one of your legacy would only convert them if they are changing or if there is a clear benefit to updating should give you a solid framework to use going while still ensuring users functionality hindered by your worked at a company which had roughly 40 or so vb time we have migrated all of these to and now years we have roughly 150 applications in all share a common making them easy to and extend where

 this is not an answer to the compilation errors you are but rather a broader view of the persistence problem you are and deserialization is not the simplest problem you can work my advice would be investing in learning libraries and using they have already worked out many of the problems you will face at one time or plus they already have different output formats first thing you must that is if you decide to go ahead and implement your is what will be the file format and whether it suits all your will it always be used in the same will the platform change you can decide to make it binary as it is the or make it readable for a human if you decide on json or any other more complex just forget it and use a simplest solution is working on a binary file and it is also the solution that will give you a smallest on the other it is quite sensible to architecture changes you migrate from a 32 to a 64 bit deciding the format you will need to work on the extra information that is not part of your objects now but needs to be inserted into the file for later then start working from the smallest parts to more complex advice would be to start working with the simplest most defined part and build from there start avoiding templates as much as and once you have it clear and working for a given data work on how to generalize it for any other i have written the code directly on the so there could be some typos or just about anything first simple approach is just writting a textual representation of the the advantage is that it is portable and shorter in code not than the binary the resulting files will be bigger but user this point you need to know how reading text works with whenever you try to read a string the system will read characters until it reaches a this means that the following only read up to the first tab or end of when reading numbers as an the system will read all valid digits up to the first that input 12345a will consume all characters up to you need to know this because that will influence the way you persist data for later is a long will read but ignore the a b a will produce will read not you pretty much need separators to insert in the output and to parse the for sample purposes i will select the it must be a character that does not appear in the text will also be a good idea to not only separate elements but also add some extra info of the for the elements in the vector you can decide to use a different if you want to be able to read the file manually you can use so that each item is in its own textual inventoryitem const data return o const v o for int i i o will call the above defined you will need to split the input by to get each element and then with to parse the textual template void const t data str create a stream with the st use inventoryitem data quantity in wholesalecost in wholesalecost return data int tmp size without last parameter getline splits by size obtain size as for int i i inventoryitem tmp read an inventory data return the vector reading function i have used getline parse to read the that is to guarantee that the next will actually read the first inventoryitem and not the trailing after the most important piece of code there is the template that is able to convert from a string to any type that has the insertion operator it can be used to read primitive library types for and user types that have the operator we use it to simplify the rest of the code quite a a binary this will be a pain in the ass if you the simplest way i can think of is writing the number of elemements in the vector as a the size is in your followed by all the each element will printout the binary representation of each of its for basic types as it will just output the binary format of the for strings we will resort to writting a number with the number of characters in the string followed by the contents of the void const str int size write the size write the template void t data will work only with pod data and not data void inventoryitem const data void const v int size size could use the size for int i i i have selected a different name for the template that writes basic types than the functions that write strings or the reason is that we want to later on by mistake use the template to write a complex type userinfo containing that will store an erroneous representation in from disk should be fairly binary template void void str int size buffer new create a temporary buffer and read into size str delete void inventoryitem data void inventoryitem v clear the vector in case it is not int size for int i i inventoryitem item item using this the and must be opened in binary v work on v error checking is left as an exercise for the reader you have any question on any part of the just

 this kind of question i think you have to be very specific about what you are looking as there are many ways of interpreting it and many different some approaches are going to be too big a hammer if your question does not warrant the simplest there is the table data exactly the same or which you might attempt to answer with a simple count comparison before moving on to anything more the other end of the scale there is me the rows from each table for which there is not an equivalent row in the other or me where rows have the same identifying key but different data you actually want to sync table a with table b then that might be relatively using a merge

 those of you with curriculum development what is the best strategy regarding have seen some schools that teach arrays after variables and control often before even teaching this allows teaching of some rudimentary it then brings the problem of how to pass arrays to so it is necessary to go back to arrays pointers are taught and patch things option is to go from variables and control structures to and then teach and once you have teach arrays from and then use that to get to dynamic memory me the second option makes more because unlike simple with arrays it is easy to out of but students who did not yet learn about memory and pointers may not understand what lies outside these interested to know what others teaching is it better to teach arrays before or after	
 though clojure was developed with java developers it was not written java is designed to interoperate well in the java it this is not it was designed for least not in language part of the and implies that the language and jvm are interconnected in some way that makes them they are conjure is a native jvm language jython or and it uses a very virtual machine to live greg said clojure is built to be with and unless you want to really get into software transactional memory say to check out a different clojure was not to be with it was built for the you can use java libraries if you but it required it is and as far as the advice to use a different lisp if you want to learn clojure meant to be it is meant to be a and by the that means to enhance lisp in certain to make it more modern and ability to work well with java should be considered a not a greg above points languages like clojure and groovy target the jvm for one main so that java developers can have the best of both for reasons stated they were not written for java sorry to be so blunt but i seen one educated post on clojure in these i just learned about clojure it is just frustrating to see this kind of harmful advice so easily will just end with a quote by rick hickey guy who wrote can hate java and like the goes on to say that that is where he

 thought i would ask this question to see why many examples and people prefer to use inline databinding in the aspx code vs implementing an ondatabinding event when using any control i always implement the ondatabinding method for field level controls if i need to do anything that built in out of the box i need to do an most examples i see have the code right in the aspx page using the inline of inline of how i prefer to do the the codebehind void literal lit personally prefer the codebehind method because it keeps my aspx pages clean and i have all this inline code all over the place and the next guy just knows to always look in the files for code the seperation of presentation and code is also maintained better this way as the html is place holders only and the codebind is determining what is actually being put in these are very basic the field could be a integer that you want to format with leading 0s or a datetime that needs a specific format it could also take all sort of manipulation and code to get the finally value that should be stored in the property at the do you draw the line and move it to the codebehind if you are using inline are the pros and cons for doing it either one take more overhead than the i am not talking about assigning a value to a control that is just on the page but one that is being databound to because it exists in a repeater template or gridview item template obviously a literal sitting on a page you can just assign in i thought i would gather more especially with regards to the do most people not use the ondatabinding vs cons and

 threadpool is always there are a finite number of threads allocated to the pool based on the number of for it is generally a bad idea to use threads unless you really are starting off an async process and know that there be a large number of requests that there are a finite number of threads in the threadpool which you share with everything running in your appdomain and there is a realistic limit on the total number of threads you want to create using new as winforms apps consider using the backgroundworker instead of using a thread or the it uses the it makes communicating between threads easier on the savvy using as your app pool could disappear at any move this work outside or use webbackgrounder if you what not to do in

 time iterating through something row by and then doing some kind of processing on each is going to get a little would be inclined to approach this problem by having a step before this which prepared the mdictmergefields collection so that it contained elements that were not or this will mean you have to check for that on each you could do this in or in the background while the user is doing something other thing to try is to change the block so that not checking at the end of each imported row whether or the record is the get a count of the and then compare the current index to the knowm maximum might be x as while x objdatafields as each fieldindex as integer in strvalue if not then strname end if really work with the office interop but hopefully this might offer some post let me know how it

 title was definitely the tip of the hope not way off base here on my testing of wcf services can be done many different using test tools such as microsoft team borland silk mercury or something like loadgen or a custom test my preference is to try to take the approach that done in creating some sort of functional unit test and then feeding data into that while using the test tool to spin up multiple concurrent instances of that test the tooling of most commercial test tools really facilitate this type of testing so its difficult to go wrong the biggest challenge usually grows out of maintaining the test cases and test data to support testing the have any built in counters related to thats actually a blind you can see how many connections are being made to the but this is coarse information and you probably want to know which services are servicing those rumor is that as part of providing a rich hosting environment for will include surfacing performance counters for the hosted we will have to wait and see what actually shakes i needed to instrument a wcf service without impacting the existing codebase look into how much mileage i could get out of a wcf behavior that i could apply to the this custom behavior could likely surface the performance counters you might i would care about results of a functional the caveat is that there is likely some startup which can be probably look to profile the execution of a functional test to get execution metrics but not turn on code profiling during a performance again custom behaviors might be the you could log operational metrics to a database and then report off commercial products like amberpoint and soa software will provide support for this as well performance requests to a wcf i immediately think of especially if your looking to make the request

 to would be my short answer recommendation to combine the 2 values as it will maintain the distribution shape as you mentioned and should solve the problem of combining the the distribution of the 2 variables is different which sounds likely this really give you what i think your which is a combined measure of where each variable is within its given you would have to come up with a metric which determines where in the given distribution the value this could be done many one of which would be to determine how many standard deviations away from the mean the given value you could then combine these 2 values in some way to get your may no longer be have to work out what makes the most sense for the data sets your looking standard deviations may well be meaningless for your but you need to look at statistical measures that related to the distribution and combine rather than combing absolute normalized or

 took this from another i appropriate uses for sqlite it where sqlite works usually will work great as database engine for low to traffic websites is to of all the amount of web traffic that sqlite can of on how heavily website uses its any site that gets than 100k should work with the 100k is a conservative not a upper sqlite has demonstrated to work with 10 that amount of where another rdbms work you have many client accessing a common database over you should consider using database engine of sqlite will work over network but because of latency associated with most performance will not the file locking logic many network implementation contains bugs unix and if file does not work like it it be possible for two or more programs to modify the same part the same database at the same resulting in database because this problem results from in the underlying there is sqlite can do to prevent good rule of thumb is that should avoid using sqlite situations where the same will be accessed simultaneously many computers over a going to show my ignorance here but what is the difference between these is the difference between a web application and a	
 tool that will most probably make your pb experience way better is visual which provides a good source such a tool should have been integrated into the pb ide a long time only problem is that not as opposed to the other tools you using external source you can probably take advantage of which is a scripting language that lets you perform actions such as export and import of pb objects from outside of the it will require some but you can setup a basic dev env using batch files with orca scripts and some additional external this setup will lack any visual editing which means no gui or dw if mostly into it could but then if the why use pb in the first too have heard use of vs will be limited to some which will probably benefit only a very small portion of the pb programmers afraid the rest of us are stuck with the awful ide for years to

 transformation matrix is the inverse of the the matrix is the combination of a translation to the position and a rotation to the if is the 3x3 rotation matrix corresponding to the orientation and is the then the 4x4 matrix 0 0 that assumed that vectors are column vectors which are multiplied on the right to perform if you use the opposite make sure to transpose the find you can use one of the formulas listed on depending on your particular convention for and keep in mind that those formulas use the convention that vectors are row vectors which are multiplied on the of computing the matrix and inverting a more efficient numerically alternative is to calculate the matrix to do just invert the position negating all 3 and its orientation negating the and yaw and adjusting them to be in their proper and then compute the matrix using the same

 try to explain the problem as best as i can since it is a bit strange for have a class library that defines a bunch of classes that will used as data transfer objects or a windows forms application that has a reference to this dtos class library and also a reference to another class library which defines the presenters for the model view presenter presenter class library has a reference to another class library which contains wcf proxy wcf proxys class library has a reference to another class library with all the interfaces that define the contracts for the wcf this library with the wcf contracts has a reference to the first dtos class library since they are received as parameters for the after explaining this infrastructure the problem is that the windows form project is not compiling the error getting does not implement interface member cannot implement it does not have the matching return type of the code looks like interface is defined on the presenters class interface iemployeeview jobdescriptions is the form in the windows forms partial class employeeview iemployeeview public jobdescriptions set do something i need i know all the class libraries separation may sound weird but because of the deployment i mention before that the presenter class library does not have a reference to the dto one and neither does the wcf services it seems it is being pulled from the service interfaces class library since if i manually add it to the presenter one i get a circular reference with multiple reference to a class

 turns out to be a pretty deep area of but the basic outline is a hash function is just a function that takes things from one space strings of arbitrary and maps them to a space useful for indexing you only have a small space of things to you might get away with just interpreting those things as and done 4 byte got a much larger if the space of things you allow as keys is bigger than the space of things you are using to index or then you possibly have a unique value for each when two or more things hash to the same have to handle the redundancy in an appropriate way is usually referred to as a and how you handle it or will depend a bit on what you are using the hash implies you want it to be unlikely to have the same and you probably also would really like the hash function to be these two properties a few has kept many people practice you usually should be able to find a function that is known to work well for your application and use to make this work as a imagine you care about memory then you can create an array as long as your indexing set for as you add something to the you hash key and look at the array at that if there is nothing you put your value if there is already something you add this new entry to a list of things at that along with enough information original or something to find which entry actually belongs to which as you go a every entry in your hashtable is either or contains one or a list of retrieving is a simple as indexing into the and either returning the or walking the list of values and returning the right course in practice you typically do it wastes too much so you do everything based on a sparse array the only entries are the ones you actually everything else is implicitly are lots of schemes and tricks to make this work but the

 two parts to your why are writes you say you have large you may want to clarify that with some the microsoft teams have demonstrated loads in less than an but of course using gear and specialized data warehousing been involved with data warehousing teams that regularly loaded so much data overnight that the transaction log drives had to be over a terabyte just to handle the quick but not a terabyte per find out why writes are want to compare your load methods to data warehousing for have you tried using staging table data and log files on different if not sure where to check out my perfmon tutorial to measure your system looking for how do you scale asked how to set up multiple database servers so that one handles the bulk load while others handle reads and some i would heavily caution against taking the approach because it gets a lot more complicated but using multiple servers for reads is not easiest way to do it is with log every x the primary server takes a transaction log backup and then that log backup is applied to the reporting some catches with this the data is a little and the restore process has to kick all connections out of the database to apply the this can be a perfectly acceptable solution for things like data where the end users want to keep running their own reports while the new data you can simply not do transaction log restores while the data warehouse is and the users can maintain connections the whole help find out what solution is right for consider adding the following to your size of your database in of millions of rows in the largest table having the size of your server storage box with 10 drives has different solutions available than a box hooked up to a method of loading data it are you using bulk are you using table

 two terms differentiate between two different ways of walking a is probably easiest just to exhibit the consider the b e first traversal would visit the nodes in this that you go all the way one leg before moving first traversal would visit the node in this we work all the way each level before going that there is some ambiguity in the traversal and cheated to maintain the order at each level of the in either case i could get to b before or after and likewise i could get to e before or after this may or may not depends on you kinds of traversal can be achieved with the the root node in are nodes in n get the node from store all the children of n in do some work on difference between the two traversal orders lies in the choice of use a recursive implementation uses the use a recursive implementation looks work on the payload foreach child of alternate time to work on the payload node recursion ends when you reach a node that has no so it is guaranteed to end acyclic this still cheated a with a little cleverness you can also the nodes in this is a variation of where i do the work at each node until walking back up the i have however the higher nodes on the way down to find their traversal is fairly natural in the recursive implementation the line above instead of the first and not hard if you use a explicit but leave it as an

 types in are and is a which can be assigned to a variable or field to indicate there is no other types in are value there is always a value with a value so no ability to indicate therefore an implementation may define specific special values to indicate often the value field is used for so using for a date of birth can indicate or for a corporate exists to express meaning of which is a little different to in most cases this will be translated to null or is a wrapper for value types to more directly express and is generally a better option than using but was added in so older designs may have started using before is

 undergraduate project dealt with transcribing notes from a wav file to a midi we handled only the simple case of one possibly playing more than one note at a time for our research into the subject before we started showed that even only one is considered the problem what frequencies are playing at any given this can be done by a of small windows one at a some heuristic to guess which frequencies are harmonies of the same and which belong to different this be easy if you know what instrument is but hard in the general because the magnitudes of each harmony differ by for you might have two cs one octave apart from one or you might have one c but from a different you know what notes are playing at each you have to guess when you have breaks in the you could have one long note or a series of short depending on the size of the windows you used for the initial you could have different results if you have more than one instrument at a and no two are playing the same notes or harmonies thereof at one you be able to tell the instruments apart using some heuristic on the magnitudes of the harmonies or on the sequences of notes most likely there will be times when two instruments are playing the same then you really have any way to decide if there is one instrument playing the two instruments playing at the same one playing soft and the other playing loud or any combination the short list of problems to i know of any algorithm that solves this in the general i think this problem has been solved my project presentation can be found at

 understand that this is a very broad but a short kind of answer will not be strategies are born to deal with broad issues should an application designer take into consideration when devising the error and exception handling the strategy will differ depending on the software type business hosted web embedded is the software type political and legal perspectives on error handling business ideas that i would have error reporting routes automatic admin in and robustness contingency and recovery against problems that are not yet users and customers fairly minimising the impact on software users and other people serviced by looking for a similar list of ideas and do use comments to point me out if i need to clarify the question further and thanks to everyone platform will definitely have some affect on the resulting implementation detail of the strategy from a developer perspective but less so from point of it is certainly most legacy systems i was asked to work on did not have a clear error handling this be made a community it seems as a good question and good questions are hard to come up do you mean by the a long term plan that gives brings consistency and coordination to error and exception in case of a larger team working on software the strategy can be formilised and distributed in a written seems to be duplicate question practices for exception management in java or and and why do you prefer exceptions or return these questions deal with a certain perspective on error handling like to learn more about other perspectives and how they contribute to the overall should be included in the error and exception handling

 unit has two distinct the interface and the interface section contains all public definitions procedure the implementation section contains all implementation you use a the uses you get access to the public definitions of that this access is not so if unit a interface uses unit and unit c uses unit you do not get access to unit b unless you use it implementation section has access to the to the unit used in both uses clauses and interfaces of used units are compiled first before it continues compiling the this has the advantage that you can have circular dependencies from within the interface fail need interface interface implementation implementation unit also has an initialization section if it has an initialization it could also have a finalization the initialization section is used to initialize the variables of the the finalization sections are used to you use its wise not to count on initializations of other just keep them simple and also are the foo foo f1 f2 f3 an identifier is defined in multiple used the last unit possible in the uses list is so f1 but you can prefix it with the unit name to solve this the introduction of multi part namespaces are allowed which introduces other nice rec1 baz bar baz which these lines gives an error and does the result change if you write uses this case you have a but that is resolved by giving namespace names higher so the first line

 want to accept any html i think i should at least use but not if you want to allow people to type characters that just mean and and anything to do with input for fields you really want to filter out much more than the control characters you usually want if you are using when you output the value back to the page you will of course remember to use so that gets escaped to and appears as a literal you need to be using any time you output a text value into html in a regardless of whether that string came from a form or the or somewhere fields where you want all input to match a particular restricted then a regexp can be a good way to match is almost always the wrong a good rule of thumb use is inadequate for sql escaping because it does not match the actual sql string literal escape so you can construct strings that are still dangerous when when using you should use other databases have their own particular escaping use them use parameterised queries so you have to manually escape text to sql at is inadequate for html escaping because it attempt to do anything with html special characters at not what any trying to cope with at the input filtering stage is keep all the strings that are internal to your application as plain and escape them on the way out of the when going out to take part in an sql when going out onto an html and so

 want to email and write to pdf very simple the reports are basically a list of divided in various the sections are not necessarily think just wasted a solid 2 days of work trying to make this kind of reports using i find that jasper is great for outputing the kind that would come out of a database for each row neatly describing an item and each item printed on a simplifying a bit but the given what i want to do i always ended up completely data not being displayed for no apparent columns of texts never the correct column positioning always ending up pagination not sanely possible was never able to figure it the faq gives an obscure came to the conclusion that jasper is really not built to make the kind of reports i am i missing ready to pay for a as long as the price is by reasonable i mean a few answer here is more information about the report i made in i want is something like i made in jasper is subreports are all the same actual this report has one field and basically just prints this field in a detail running a single subreport simply lists all items from the the datasource itself is a simple custom jrdatasource containing a collection of strings in the field the datasource iterates over the collection until there are no more each subreport has its own tried many different variations of the with all sorts of different properties for the this is fairly simple the problems i encounter are as starting from the 3rd show up when their position type is they do show up when they have relative to i want to do this because the first two subreports can be of any make each subreport to stretch according to its own they either stretch at all is not desirable because they have different or they stretch according to the longest this makes a weird layout for if some subreports fall outside the they simple one alternative is to increase the considerably and the band in this case it is not really possibly to know the total height in so stuck with it the report is even more long reports end up on one page and this is not acceptable printout text is too to have different reports with different pdf page i used ireport so possibly limitations of ireport listing here and not of jasper one of the things trying to find out asking this question one alternative would be to generate the jrxml myself with just static text but afraid encounter the very same i just generally wasted so much time getting anything done with jasper that i help thinking its not the right tool for the to say that jasper excel in what good is the best free or java reporting library for making

 wanted to have more than one controller and view for same in but it turned out to be a little complicated than i what i want to do is something like this will show product details to will show some extra information together with product and some commands like edit goal is to seperate the urls for the visitors and the first approach was that create a subfolder in the controller and the view so the things would look this way can map the urls to the correct controllers without a problem that i specify their since the class names are the when i return the view from the controller under admin it does not display the index view under the folder but the one under know i can say path to return the view i but obviously not a good solution and i want to do question what is the best way to take care of this with the condition of urls having to be that a custom controller class that overrides the view method any other ones that needs to be overriden for this and makes sure the correct view is one is an ugly but would a custom view engine that also takes folders into exactly know how i can do but as far as i this should also solve the of one actually uses a different layout for but in theory this should also but i am still not sure if this is the best way to do because having different controller view folders under the different parts of the site is not exactly what i leaning towards the custom view engine that takes the folders into consideration when returns the but like i i know how to do in controllers and

 was able to achieve what you but it looks like a workaround to me a bug on the you need to set the backgroundcolor property to black in the when you create a new uitableviewcell you need to do something like this code goes on the static nsstring try to retrieve from the table view a cell with the given uitableviewcell if no cell is create a new one using the given if cell uilabel return have to set the background color of the contentview to but when you do it the text stop so you need to add a uilabel to its content view and write the text seems overkill just to change a background but probably a bug that prevents setting a different background color on the than on its containing

 what a solution i came up with using the did check that it the xml fragment into a all the xml classes used below are from see string newnode convert this to saxreader reader new document newnodedocument get the document into which the new node is and the parent element from would need to be converted to for testing i created one like document originaldoc new element givennode the new child element is very outputting now because your question talks about how to convert between that and dom4j writer new w3cdoc w3c reader new dom4jdoc need both kind of it might make sense to put these in neat utility maybe in a class called or something like there are better ways to do even without any 3rd party but out of the solutions presented so in my view this is the easiest even if you need to do the dom4j w3c before adding dom4j dependency to your note that is an actively maintained and has some other problems improved version has been in the works for but only an alpha version you may want to consider an like read more in the question linked	
 what basis did you determine that you must translate your documentation into did you show the documentation to these japanese developers and then they said that they understand asking because all japanese take at least 6 years of all through middle school and high and even starting earlier despite it is true that most japanese do not english very most japanese developers can technical documentation in you probably cannot have a conversation with and they might not even be able to ask you questions very well in english through but most japanese developers that worked with worked with a can english documentation you do find that you need to translate your be sure that you use a service that specializes in technical it requires a very different skill set from normal you should have the vendor translate a small piece send that to your developers in and have them review the translation first before you get the whole thing are lots of firms that can handle this work but depending on volume and you might search for an independent contractor first using a search i know a lot of good translators that prefer to work solo rather than work for one of the big localization possible way to find an independent contractor is to use or and do a search for technical whatever you want to search for a search on technical many potential candidates showed with their skillsets feedback etc all

 what i gather on that creating anonymous types for and using that to get the if the no easy way to add methods on to those if the xml structure will be the same every time the sp why not create a concrete class that has all the properties you and populate a collection of those objects yourself with the that you can easily add any methods you need directly into the based on our discussion in the a the code when building up the an overload to definetype which takes a type to create an interface event have to have any methods in and when dynamically building up the extend that interface using the overload i linked you then create an extension method on that interface that does the another overload that may be of interest that takes a type to and code create an interface isaveextentable suck at naming stuff in the code you liked to in that find a method change it to private static typebuilder assemblyname an new assemblybuilder assemblybuilder modulebuilder modulebuilder typebuilder tb new return create an extension method on that interface to do the public static class public static void isaveextentable save most likely need to use reflection in your save method to get all the properties since the type was created	
 what i understand about transactions in subversion this should be possible in but i know any tool that supports background is that we are discussing a migration from pvcs dimensions to and the main feature cited as missing in subversion is a design part is an arbitrary collection of files that can be handled all the source files needed for a idea to replace this is by copy operations in a which copy the relevant files into a but if all files are copied separately this may lead to a lot of which may clutter the so it would be nice to avoid more background project consists of several subprojects which are released but which share some common source files and external libraries imported from other reason cited for the design parts is restricting dependencies on source is for managing the products of so that all of them can be updated in version control in one both kinds of files are somewhat sprinkled across are about 5 developers on the can multiple copy operations be done in a single

 will get unless i just run out of a few comments about the answer that references are two types of color interpolation that is some years trilinear interpolation product linear was a common approach for color table trilinear interpolation can indeed be implemented as a sequential set of one dimensional first on one then then along a second years ago we all realized that trilinear interpolation introduces artifacts in color when applied to certain types of the problems are seen in a solution is to move to a simplicial in by dissecting a cube into 6 in n the unit cube will be dissected into there are other dissections of a but this particular style assures that the main diagonal is always a shared edge for all the this in turn restores good behavior for when applied to certain color lookup let me get into the question of true scattered data have mentioned a variety of distance based methods are a i did some work in the past with these i actually preferred the inverse multiquadric all of these are really just variations of radial basis function a common rbf methods have their good and bad they will usually generate a smooth this of course depends on the specific basis function as well as whether you choose to limit the rbf methods also allow you to at least as far out as the support of the radial basis elements will if the basis elements are allowed to be infinite in then no explicit constraint on extrapolation will in general is a bad thing to one problem with rbf methods is they require the solution of large systems of linear and those equation systems are often dense this means the size of the in terms of the number of data points you can handle tends to be limited by the linear if you limit the support by truncating the basis then the matrices can become this will improve the linear algebra if you use a sparse matrix package for the at the same the support distance becomes a nonlinear parameter that you must as methods like multiquadrics and inverse multiquadric methods may have a secondary nonlinear parameter that controls the shape of the basis kriging has similar and lump all of these methods to these all of these methods that classed as rbf variants are often limited in the number of points they will comfortably depending upon how you deal with things and the amount of memory that limit might often be on the order of a few thousand other problem with the general class of rbf methods is what call this is a neologism i created many years ago to describe interpolation across a relatively large hole in the in there may often be problems even when interpolating across smaller holes in the these because they are smooth to some may introduce unwanted extrema peaks or into the interpolated this is a common problem with even often seen as ringing artifacts with cubic spline or polynomial and certainly seen with fourier series the problem in higher dimensions is to even recognize that it has indeed since plotting surfaces in more than three dimensions tends to be you have more points than that or if these ringing artifacts are then other methods are often a better if you are willing to use a linear then the simplest solution in higher dimensions is to start with a tessellation of the thus in 3 tessellate the data a delaunay into this is fairly efficient to and there are many tools to be found for this it is then a simple problem to interpolate any individual merely identify which simplex the point lies compute barycentric coordinates as interpolation weights within the and form the corresponding linear combination of the function values at each vertex of the found this is all extremely fast and downside of these tessellation based methods is they typically restrict you to the convex hull of the data and as if your data happens to lie in a then the interpolant may well do strange things in some regions of your another problem with the scheme i mentioned is the interpolant will only be piecewise but once you move into higher dimensions things get nasty other methods are to be found for smooth interpolation based on a but they will take more effort and are therefore far less basic tradeoffs should be obvious if you need a smooth interpolant and only have a few then rbf methods are often they are easy to the actual method chosen is often just a matter of or even used one tool before and was probably be happy with it since the question was which method is for practical point out that best is a very subjective word when applied out of what are your goals in an interpolation what skill set do you what set of tools do you know how to what environment will you work all of these factors will influence your choice of the best you have many data and speed is of the but ultimate smoothness is not that then you will generally look for a simplicial of if you have sufficient then the piecewise linear nature of the beast is of less the piecewise linear interpolant here has the great virtue in some cases that it can never generate extrema in your surface that did not exist in the for some color characterization for this is of paramount other issue is with while the presence of noise is often a signal that smoothing of some sort is not all such surfaces have smoothing any smoothing operator will sometimes smooth out important features of the data this happens because we can think of a smoothing operator as a low pass high frequency behavior is often but it may also be just a sharp toe or shoulder in my surface that i cannot afford to if this is a then you may be willing to use an interpolant even in the presence of sometimes significant in that suggest that the lowest order interpolant is a more global interpolant will also tend to amplify any noise in the so if you look for the lowest variance interpolant in the presence of it will generally be a linear there are many varieties of thin plate interpolatory or once you go beyond one your options also at least if you are willing to do the end here before it turns into a

 with this will take awhile of a simple address book where you just add records on the end as new friends or colleagues arrive next entry would go at bob 7 station greg 3 railway boot allan 27 carriage dc allan 1066 hastings dc you need to find no i hear you just scan the list looking for the then read off the what if so stunningly popular that you have friends like me such a i only allocate friends in powers of two i actually have but of them are being held in limbo unitl i can get another 24 together order to find a particular have to on 512 entries of those in quite the worst case is scanning all of them to find the last person you add that every time you add a new delete them if they cause you too much you update this index which stores just the name in sorted order along with the line number of the full entry index pages in your address book are magic and everything you write in index for out above would allan allan greg bob names and line numbers take up less space than the full entries but the most important aspect is order to find an you only have to worst 10 entries you check index number if the name looking for is greater than you only have to look at entries if now only interested in entries in either immediately cut down your search space by the original you can only discard the one you check since you have the ordering information available to the size of the search space goes like this actually used powers of two for the indexed method but slightly better than iteration indexed method old method 0 1024 1024 1 512 1023 2 256 1022 3 128 1021 4 64 1020 5 32 1019 6 16 1018 7 8 1017 8 4 1016 9 2 1015 10 1 1014 found the extract the line number from it because you know got 16 entries per entry number 275 is on page line you can go straight there without further at the cost of a little more storage space and some time maintaining the increased the speed of your and what indexes do in databases as

 wonder if there are any suggestions for declarative gui programming in abhor gui but am getting a little tired of manually instantiating jpanels and boxes and jlabels and jlists my overall but i have two specific questions for approaches thinking of is there an example somewhere of a realistic gui display not circles and but listboxes and buttons and labels and the in which can interface with a java sourcefile that accesses and updates various old swing with something to parse has anyone invented a declarative syntax for xml for use with java i suppose it be hard to to create some code based on stax which reads an xml instantiates a hierarchy of swing and makes the hierarchy accessible through some kind of object but rather use something and documented and tested than to try to invent such a thing not exactly but kinda close had good luck with jgoodies but their syntax for form layout seems kinda lots of great answers i added be especially grateful for hearing any experiences any of you have had with using one of these frameworks for i did try a few google searches gui just quite know what to look for declarative gui programming in

 work as a physicist in a uk i should emphasise that different areas of research have different emphasis on particle physicists do computational modelling almost exclusively and may collaborate on large software whereas people in fields like my own write code relatively i suspect most scientists fall into the latter i would say coding skills are usually seen as useful in but not much like skills are seen as useful for programmers but not with this in have you used for developing scientific data what what do you use for data analysis and plotting is done using generic data analysis packages such as which can be thought of as these packages typically have a scripting language that can be used to more specialist analysis may have a dedicated utility for the job that generally will have been written a long time has the source for and is pretty some more techie types might use the languages that have been mentioned matlab with gnuplot for software is commonly done in although we actually use delphi which is somewhat there any training for people without any significant background in been to seminars on grid 3d learning boost given by both universities been as an undergraduate we were taught vba for excel and matlab but is more you have anything like version bug although people do have personal development our code base is in a shared folder on a which is kept current with a synching would you go about trying to create a decent environment for without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists physicists are stubborn step at a i am trying to replace the shared folder with something a bit more perhaps finding a svn client which mimics the current synching tools behaviour would say though on the for most natural science time is generally better spent doing	
 work for a software development company and we have around 100 people working on a of these people are lately management wants to have a better way to rate individual programmers performance so the suggestion was to use bug reports as a the more bug reports on a developer the worse he this seems for more reasons than i can tell it is a subjective way of developers work on different projects of differing in addition if qa is measured for the number of bug reports they generate there will be a lot of discussions about the validity of bug would be a better way to measure developers performance in such a suggestion would be to not use bug reports from qa as a measure and instead use bug reports from like beta testers then when such public bug reports are issued also let qa be measured by after reading some of your excellent responses i was thinking that the general problem with the above described metric is that it is negative reporting bugs it encourage producing good quality i think the problem is that it is two there are the on one side who treat programmers as workers they want metrics then we have the who want to see themselves as artists or disturb me i am i think measuring quality can be done by metrics not without being instead things how a person reacts to willingness to creativity and above all quality of work are important and but mostly not necessarily

 work on a couple of projects that connect with external services like facebook and at this moment most libraries using to access these apis including the ones written myself have single methods so call specific api functions yet always seem to call some sort of base method to make the something like class public string criteria something unique to this method with criteria generating an xml statement or fql return modifiedcriteria public string criteria something unique to this method with criteria generating an xml statement or fql return modifiedcriteria public string modifiedcriteria global things to modifiedcriteria like authentication wrapping the criteria in some xml or json var request new the return my question is there a better pattern or oo principal to use here so in each singular api call method not explicitly calling a base method every what looking for some kind of invocation interception like the mvc framework and not looking to use the features of any other service or library like for these projects only using of these capabilities and prefer to roll my own code for these external rest api access

 work tried a pilot project to migrate historical data from an erp the size of the data is on the small only covering over 21 million the largest table having 16 million an additional million rows waiting to come into the pipe but the pilot has been shelved due to other the plan was to use facility to schedule queries that would regenerate data on a daily basis suitable for use in simple aggregates over the large record the first thing i noticed is how sensitive it is to the amount of ram an increase in ram at one point allowed for a worth of aggregates without resorting to sequential table you decide to use i would highly recommend the config as it tends to ship with the most conservative settings possible that it will run on systems with little tuning takes a little maybe a few but once you get it to a point where response is just set it and forget you have the tuning done all about turn your attention to your indexing and query planning also requires a little effort but once set find it to be partial indexes are a nice feature for isolating those records that have data in i highly recommend this feature if you are looking for exceptions in a sea of similar use the table space feature to relocate the data onto a fast drive

 worry about users doing just to break your if they really want to break your code they can without you providing accessors to your internal by returning a constant the common user will not mistakenly modify your prevents not a malicious coder can break it anyway if they really care and know the environment is lost in the compilation process all compilers i know once the compilation unit is converted into binary those objects do not know about and that can be exploited to take int a a a const return int int does not include but redefines an almost exact copy of a int a a int const return int private int a 10 the code above is incorrect definition rule is there are two definitions for class the fact is that with most compilers the definition of a and malitious a are binary the code will compile and and the result is that external code has access to your private that you know of do it will later be a maintenance pain in the that has cost microsoft quite a bit of money in providing backwards compatibility to software that used private parts of the api returned objects versions of the api that shared the same public interface but changed the internals would break some third party application with some broadly available software the provider in this will go through the pain of providing backwards but with lesser known applications they and suddenly your previously running application will fail in all sort of

 would assign points to the files depending on how many rules if you want certain rules to supercede you can give more points for that as if if find the highest value in the as if the best picture is more side givign your rules multiples of a value will ensure that a rule can be than all 5 rules rule values 2 2 4	
 would assume that the debugger needs to wake up for every method call to see if it matches the that were selected to because it has to check every method call for a potential match before it can execute it is considerably slower than if it does not have to do all these	
 would avoid storing anything if would compromise the functionality of the storing something like a user shopping cart user are i keep this kind of thing in the session data on the a name or profile info display purposes customization preferences are	
 would be a excellent example of the use of an array within defines each and a function calling itself whenever it finds a new array to as long as the function cleans up appropriately the largely i know which function rather level 1 level 2 level 3 level level level now quake beneath the power of this fully operational recursive echo as if else echo echo kick off from the top	
 would be a good coding practice in this case to use the ternary also you need to have three equal signs when comparing with this is the most concise 0 hopefully will save your hands some	
 would be how i expected things to the block will not release its resources until it so in that sense the resource has escaped lexical however but this is no different to making a function call that tried to use the same resource within a with block nothing helps you in the case where the block has yet for not really anything specific to thing that might be worth worrying about though is the behaviour if the generator is i would have expected the block to act like a block and call the part on but that seem to be the	
 would be inclined to split the view into multiples as ideally you want to avoid conditional logic in a view you find that would cause some duplication between your then likely that you could move that duplicated content into shared	
 would be more doable if you were using an unordered which would always take the same amount of space for the since you are using an ordered i would stick with the as is that ie and firefox make the same amount of space for the marker irregardless of the number of digits in the marker or the size of the so you need to take matters into your own hands by creating the space the trick here is to know by ie and firefox use different properties to create the ie uses on the while firefox uses so have to reset both of these values to achieve	
 would be much easier to do in procedural looping through each character and marking them off in an or is this some	
 would be nice if in xaml when i define that visual studio would be smart enough to go find the property availablecontracts on the modelview which the datacontext is bound reflect and then when i would up intellisense of the bindable properties that are available to in my contractmodelview since availablecontracts is a list see why visual studio go follow this logical path and give me the needed can anyone explain what the disconnect here or surely there is some way to it some so that it could provide any tools to do perhaps in i hear mef is going to make intellisense much better in hope lack of databinding intellisense when writing my xaml views just feels like to get intellisense when doing xaml data	
 would be preferable to redirect the client to another page after the if you really need the client stay in the same you can use a variable on your page to state if the insert has been and skip the insert logic if it has been executed	
 would be the best way to reorganize the project and refactor the code so that it retains its current ability to access everything think actually quite close and probably better than many python projects where they just assume that there is only one instance of the and store values in a module global or is ok for many simple but really nicest to be able to bundle everything up into one application object that owns all inner classes and methods that need to know the first thing i would do from the looks of the code above would be to factor out any of those modules and classes that a core competency of your things that necessarily need access to the names like and sound suspiciously like much of their contents really specific to your they could perhaps be refactored out into separate standalone or submodules of your package that only have static stuff not relying on application i would put the main owner application class in the rather than a then from your or just the you can get a complete instance of the application as simply could also consider moving any basic deployment settings from the settings class into the you only have one possible set of settings and every time you instantiate you get the same little use in having all this ability to encapsulate your whole you might as well simply be using module doing with some of my apps is making the owned classes themselves into actual members of the owner application def def def possible to change or configure the application from outside it by the inner class def send called actually return not that worried about internal data this is python not we worry too much about evil programmers using properties and methods they we just put at the start of the name and let that be a suitable warning to those long chains slow the code down as really readability is the important anything else is premature	
 would be the same for every a static variable is a static however nested it make things in that a static variable in is separate to the one in but not relevant you want to make something depend on the instance of the it needs to be an instance variable within advise against naming a case the same as its base by the

 would create a dictionary with a string key and a integer storing the next number to use for a given this will be almost in nextfreeactionnumbers void new and so on string int32 number number return you will have to check against collisions with user edited again a dictionary might be a smart there is no way around what ever way you generate your the user can always change a existing name to the next one you generate unless you include all existing names into the generation use a special character that is not allowed in user edited but that would be not that of the comments on reusing the holes i want to add it resuse the holes generated be renaming or this will confuse the user because names he deleted or modified will suddenly

 would create the extra column for string not true normalization but the easiest to implement and to work the same field for both numbers and strings would work to as long as you plan on doing anything with the numbers like summing or extra table approach while good from a normalization standpoint is probably overly

 would definitely hire a but not sure our definitions of hacker are to a hacker is a coder who knows enough about everything to at least know where to look to figure out how to do at my company we regularly hire hackers as we do a lot of things with scripting languages and unixy stuff least our team question is actually whether or not you should hire a and it really depends on what the job description but as long as you trust not to do anything i would hire if he or she is a all that really matters to	
 would ditch the stuff not very and can get you very first glance i thought you could use the and directives to add in what you but when i look more closely i realised it having a little difficulty understanding your data model a page can have many or is teaching the project name and then it has that is the then you probably need to look at a plugin like subdomainfu and use subdomains based on project rather than hacking the routes file we have used this successfully to give a scheme like you describe domain implies the bit of extra code and also things like and can be fun if you want to use but a different	
 would do something like the into cache values duplicate key update generation generation the generation value to 0 in code or in the sql but the using the on to increment the i think the syntax	
 would do that as set specific visibility for your views block with nodes list to be shown only on that module can be helpful here also for managing bunch of nodes	
 would first narrow down the problem by taking out everything except the join and seeing what the result join ratings on and this gives you i would then add back in the where do this step by and whenever you get a query where you have no rows then look at the previous set of and think about what is happening when you add the additional being able to see this set of results will help you identify and understand the adding back to the query until you start getting no at least then narrowed down to what aspect of the query is causing the

 would follow the requirement the first time the application is i would also provide a simple way to switch from full screen to for instance by pressing esc another way to go back to full then i would store the mode when quitting the application and restore this mode at next	
 would go a bit further than generally i do the a in the model to execute the the from the controller and store the results in an instance put the instance variable in the would only use a helper if absolutely when going back over your code easier to make sense of things if you see your controller setting up the data that the view rather than the view calling the helper another file to look

 would just truncate each table as table is the name of the copied and you would copy the 2nd line for each table in the sure with about you could create a script that would read over all the available tables listed in the systables and use that information to do a while loop so you have to write table for each but the general all that answered after getting this mental thing going on because i write up that he should have created a tsql script and a database off of were several reasons why i go that know what sorts data he has in specifically how to clear the currently know what the built into the rest of there could potentially that he needs a copy original in order to satisfy the gentleman asked this in a different i may have indeed answered like so many have and simply stated to script the database

 would like to be able to display time based on the current time i will be storing times in utc format in my but wish to normalize these to the time so far the option that seems most viable is to capture the clients time and then deteremine the difference between that and current utc and use that delta to normalize times when i would like to know if there are any more straight forward options available to detect and normalize a utc time to that of the requesting client

 would like to create a web are when a request would result in refreshing the content in or sometimes even more the cleanest way would be to run the requests one after the other in a sequence and handle the results one by i would like to have only one request if it is and collecting all the results for the there is a main container and some other containers simple way would main function from server for show it in m container some other content from server dedicated for show it in some other content from server dedicated for show it in some other content from server dedicated for show it in on the main function requested by the just some of the containers have to refresh not all of would like to minimise the number of actually minimise it to of it could be done by or would like to collect all the responses from the encapsulate them is content for content for and send it back to the where the client would unpack and regarding to the it would delegate each of them to the appropriate question that how would you do when you that the returned data is very in some cases it might contain even html double if i am not in some special cases this could screw up json and xml as idea was to divide the different contents by special separators now just for an easy example use and it is a very uggly but you cannot screw up the content for if the separators are unique previous solution would look like is content for content for on the client side split the code first by which would result in this case in two array elements what are going to be split again by the first element would give the the second one the content for after this the last step would be walking through the new and display the result in the appropriate there anybody who would suggest a nicer way for or who could show a safe way to do it in or for several

 would like to learn a language that will teach good programming that sound like you may learn the fundemantals of using a forloop but not the best choice if you want to learn good programming you develop outside a fat ide python is not really a language for not sure about ruby but i think pretty similar in that respect hard to analyze the code staticaly so not much use of ides that try to guess what you are thinking when you push a both ruby and python are great languages if you can make a small shift in your thought process to grasp the that leaves you whith which is a great language and with which you are pretty much stuck on windows i know of a far cry from ms in my opinion is not very well suited for learning the basics of programming not web recommendation is to try and develop something small with any of these and see what you like set yourself a a blogging engine is a bit too much and maybe a service like	
 would like to look at the code for some of the classes in the i find functions by using intellisense and just reading the tooltips that come up when i select different example is the contains method that you can use on arrays to search for a given i just happened to stumble upon that while working on an exercise to assuming a simple method that just iterates through the array and checks for the string at each i wanted to take a look at this or code for any other class in how would i go about i have visual studio to view code for classes in the

 would love to have the ability to natively call regular expressions in sql server for ad hoc queries and use in stored our allow us to create clr functions so i have been using as a kind of poor query editor for the ad hoc it is especially useful when working with structured data such as json or xml that has been saved to the i agree that it seems like an oversight that there is no regular expression it seems like an obvious feature for a query hopefully we will see it in a future version but people have been asking for it for a long time and it made way into the product most frequent reason i have seen against it is that a poorly formed expression can cause which in will not abort and almost always requires the machine to be maybe once they address that in the framework we will see it included in a future version of sql	
 would love to use closures in i have read that they may or may not make it into java but an project called has implemented functional features including safe would it be to use such a library in an enterprise production there a better way to add closures to java safe would it be to use to add closures to a java production

 would maybe think about wrapping your user object in a seperate class then setting the datacontext properties of that contain the class public userinfo userinfo public userextendedinfo userextendedinfo in your binding for the usercontrol should be set in its but for clarity assumes that your userinfo class has a property of your userextendedinfo class has a property of locale and	
 would need to use pgp or something similar on the client side there are standards for signing and verifying signatures on messages and there are certainly commercial and free products for i would recommend using pgp on the and you can look up either a pgp library for java to use on the or you can check out how pgp wraps up the data to emulate that signing data is a standard and well documented albeit library for java has some openpgp you can check it out to see how compatible it is with a pgp implementation for windows or whatever the clients also has some openpgp support but that library was meant for java and been updated since i recommend you use bc	
 would normally say that you should leverage your experience in programming for machines that are and low on web development is a very different web servers will usually have a lot more computational power and either the lamp or other requires a different paradigm of you will often spend more time on integrating multiple processes scripting than actually pushing out more speed and the transition is not so like the previous answer you may want to consider going the development you could get the development kit and begin whatever you can get your hands on within your	
 would not assuming that the two object have the same interface with respect to the properties that you want to i would use reflection and copy the values of the change to the existing if any of the values are different from the the record will get marked as needing to be updated and submitchanges will take care of example little error foreach bookinfo in var partialinfo if null you knew that they were the same type you could reuse the first propertyinfo instead of getting a new one for	
 would not dirty your control version system with such series of auto but i agree with the idea of using a control version system to provide that my suggestion use a repository for your software and another one for store the auto when the work is merge all auto commits in the main repository in only one logical i would do the main the location of your development the location of your work with dirty working remote add foo git fetch the checkout bar the begining of the tag the do git add git commit would not use a cron so you can the autocommits your your job deactivate the pending you have a lot of auto commits in branch and you have tagged the initial commit of the branch with your auto tag push foo user session push foo user session you have published your work and your lecturer may access update your foo rebase barbegin and proceed as described would squash all the there can be only push foo only one commit will be tag tag branch all i think no useful information may be gathered with such kind of i would try to avoid this but if really i would do that	
 would not recommend done in the past for the exact same is create a scheduled task that runs ever n kicks off a small script that simply does these 2 checks for flag is read from the if the flag is then the script immediately stops end if the flag is the script kicks off a separate process in a new thread utilizes a service to perform a task that can be either very short or sometimes really depending on the amount of records to this process of course sets and resets the isalreadyrunning flag to ensure threads do not kick off actions that i have a service been running for years now with this approach and i never had any problems with my main process utilizes a web service and bunch of other things to perform some heavy backup

 would port them to um there are cobol compilers for current platforms out there unless we know a little more about why the code to be we may not be able to the platform on which it runs is management just pushing for a more are you having to move stiff from system z to windows its purest not that oocobol is mostly a simple procedural language so will translate to any of the other procedural languges fairly without although you avoid classes unless you have one big one language for perl et al can be made to	
 would probably be better to use rather than because the latter has the semantics of and the former seems to have the semantics that going you could also easily put an image on such a button as well and it would probably save you the trouble of having to write a javascript you want to continue using i think returning from the event will do since it has the semantics of submitting the the form will just be in order to counter you could maybe place an attribute in the form in the you could then check which button was pressed and depending on that return or returning here prevent the form from	
 would probably have to use the property of triggered by can also use animations if you want the zoom effect to be option could be to place your inside a or use a i suggest you take a look at the i think supports berk berk

 would probably use linq to xml and to generate the new object and then pass that object to the json	
 would put the xml construction code inside the domain that you can just call from web service or data	
 would recommend changing that datatype to up to about 10 the might make sense since a tad faster and has less overhead but with 50 unless all the columns are fully used up to 50 this is a major especially since this column is also used in it to would possibly quite significantly reduce the space needed for the table on your amount of data and how much of the 50 chars are really and all the indices involved would also get a lot smaller plus you need this rtrim stuff anymore	
 would recommend checking out wcf instead of webservices it gives you more more will deal with short network and it gives you easy support for mtom encoding for large and even supports if you plan on serving up video or other	
 would recommend learning since it is not only but it also takes advantage of the richness of the framework to allow to use objects where it is and clojure are other functional languages that can also use objects where	
 would recommend looking at using and together for your windowing as of qt is now and supports and mac out of the	
 would recommend making your script automatically print usage it be run without 0 echo param1 echo echo	
 would recommend putting your website code under full version control or test and maintain your source in a private sandbox and just check out the latest stable version at the production site whenever ready for database even for small projects i maintain separate development and production you can version the sql used to generate and maintain your schema and testing or bootstrapping data along with the rest of your manage the database environment used by your site from an easily separated configuration and tell your version control solution to ignore urls are going to be a if you avoid you could always store the hostname in the same configuration file and read it as except within stylesheets and javascript of my second choice for that problem would be magic or its equivalent in the development and my last choice would be just messing with the file when i wanted to test features that depend on	
 would recommend that you avoid using as this has been deprecated in python and removed in i know using but the reason has fallen into disfavour is that it is a very slow way to not sure why your effort with perhaps you forgot to use the function call versus just the function versus	
 would recommend that you change your architecture to work more like a parser in a want to create a lexer that returns a sequence of and then a parser that reads the sequence of tokens and does stuff with your case the tokens would of would treat by its self as an embedded new and therefore include it as part of a column data a would constitute an end of line has the advantages only 1 pass over the storing a max of 1 lines worth of as much memory as possible the string builder and the easy to change should your requirements a sample of what the lexer would look i even let alone this so need to clean it up and make sure it public tokentype type private public string data private public type public string type data var builder new while var c switch case if yield return new yield return new case var next if if yield return new yield return new if yield return new string var ret return code would then look like void var columndata new bool lastwascolumndata bool seenanydata foreach token in switch case seenanydata if do some error lastwascolumndata case if lastwascolumndata case if seenanydata lastwascolumndata if	
 would recommend the howtos from the linux documentation specifically x window user and the window system architecture overview	
 would recommend using a following just add the errors to programmatically if they occur and set the visibility to i originally read the part about the master one issue probably going to run into is finding that control from your content here is one way you can do lstreference occured contacting occured processing panreference	
 would recommend using instead of reinventing the all you have to do is stick a bit of javascript in your master page and your	
 would recommend using only between your local and the remote between your local and local stick to standard git only you could possibly try a work flow like switch to and do svn pulls in changes from the remote and merges it with switch over to and do pulls the changes from and merges it with i think that it should just the local trunk and work on the clone	
 would recommend you to start reading pragmatic from journeyman to too many programing languages out there all have their pros and mentioned in pragmatic programmer try to learn a new language every done with try out and do some projects and browse through the foss projects done using that language to learn best the involved in its nuisances and everything at once yield useful results and may confuse you more when you see it time hacking with it and doing project is the right way to learn new things and some times getting stuck too	
 would reload the page after 5	
 would review the code of the destination page carefully you comment the error is happening it is probably using something that depends on the i have never seen a similar but it really looks like you should be focusing on any special stuff that page is	
 would say it makes no sense at and that you have gone too far if you are new to you are in no position to write a detailed design document for a i would recommend you try to implement what you already have in learn by the inevitable mistakes public and then go back and revise	
 would say just completely remove your delegate delegate is doing exactly the same thing as the you are pretty much writing your own event plumbing instead of using the event an event is pretty much exactly what except that easier to and also makes it easier to unsubscribe from the is no advantage to providing both the event does everything that your and is much more developing this as a class i would suggest just making your class not be and following the more standard the normal approach for allowing logic to be overridden or inserted into your code and allowing events would be to provide hooks for could be used in a situation like this to allow the user to plug in their own in many having protected virtual functions makes this more and much easier to should be exactly an event that notifies the user of some these should be hooks where the user attaches their instead of providing delegates and the base windows forms controls use a protected method and an event triggered by default allows a user to subclass your class and override the logic is probably why want as well as handle the one place where i would provide delegates is in rare cases where your class or method requires logic to be added by a in this you can either provide an abstract base or have a delegate that is passed in for that a good example of this is the method in where is useless without the predicate used for so passing in a delegate makes sense in this that there is no event associated with this really there to provide a different	
 would say that the chain of responsability pattern could be usefull to data the build a series of commands to send to the server from the command is processed through the chain of with data added to handle the command data the chain could look like wrap some encrypt send send data around the command extra information if data the chain could be but the other way data decrypt unwrap extra data execute can check this article for more informations about the chain of	
 would say that this cmdlet written since it succeed it should have emitted an error object which would have caused to return false which you could have checked or you suppress the error message using it looks like this snapin is using the host api to write an error string to the host a for you could do what ebgreen t watch out for all the text your profile script spits out when a new instance of powershell starts	
 would scrape it on the server because java i like static languages more then dynamic script so maintaining the logic at the backend would be more comfortable to on the other side depends on how many items you want to scrape and how complex the logic for this would perhaps the values are parseable with a single id selector in then server side processing could be	
 would seem to i would make the default a small loader with an and if the client does not support the javascript would never hide the and the content in the tag would show with the

 would send all in one big chunk as the underlying layers in therefor you dont have to worry about how big chunks you are sending as the layers will split these up as	
 would separate the two using javascript or something like that could get to be a the problem with separating the forms is you have to do it in a way where you lose your original meaning if you have other form information around the file upload you might have a bit of a nightmare on your hands but if you can put the file upload either above or below the form that submit controls then use this method on one of my sites and it works quite	
 would set the http header for the image being downloaded to rather than coming up with some javascript	
 would set up a trace in sql server profiler to see what set options settings your application is using for the and what settings are being used in by set options i a look at for a table of have seen the problem before where the set options used between ssms and an application were different that particular it was and the performance difference was huge the application would time out for certain depending on the parameter would be where i would recommend starting an by setting up a be able to see which particular calls are taking longer and the parameters that are being	
 would spend some time on first before learning mvc is based on some things from traditional be used with the mvc model and aspx but it is a good thing to still understand if you want to focus on first learn but do not spend time studying the common controls or rest of is still useful the the membership when doing and say likely a prerequisite to really using mvc there is a lot more work for out there than some employers are looking for people who know but they are mainly doing that as they are looking for people who are passionate about learning new my concern with mvc is that i see how to integrate it with traditional the reality is most jobs out there involve working with an existing not starting from	
 would start with and see if that meets your if it you can probably gut whatever you need out of the internals and create your own	
 would stay away from anything that would run too long when working in a that includes some query just to determine a static table layout you want to write the code so you can build a do this type of thing all the but mostly with stored procedure i have most of this in a template i this will display the column nicely within quotes or show function to return this into your into columnnameint columnnamevarchar columnnamechar from sure you have one row for each column in your table you have more just delete the extra ones if you want to see any dates in use the convert as shown this from syscolumns sc inner join sysobjects so on where order by the output in sql server management studio text output and do a square over the column and copy this column based back to your code and a square over the complete values in the left column of the insert statement and if you made a column it will replace the column only and leave the code unchanged to the left and do the same thing for the values in the right of the insert and you now have an insert that will build the data you want but will not waste too much time in the	
 would stay away from the entity framework or linq to sql for that matter for tiered that being said i tried either llblgen or	
 would strongly recommend setting up one procedure for a page and managing all sql actions if there are multiple tasks to perform on the page that require multiple just have one procedure manage the other your proceedure can always return multiple recordsets if page will perform faster of data going back and one all code on the sql is already compiled with executions will be able your errors much in one place as in two places having systems to decide if enough to fail passing back and forth to data minimize your points of the transaction is going web server the is left waiting for will save tons of time troubleshooting and will help modularize your code on the sql you can reuse sprocs to perform like tasks and end up with a more fleixble scalable robust	
 would suggest flexible enough to do pretty much anything you and stable and	
 would suggest investing your time in learning sql access application from and entity point for learning sql server is here server developer point for learning is here at of in order to gain a good understanding of what check the links at entity at how to write direct queries in to sql server without using any frameworks and orm then proceed to learning more advanced technologies in access application at entity framework at entity do videos and at sql server entity may also want to download which is perfect tool for playing with i suggest subscribing to related team at check existing open source projects at which use these technologies and digg into their source on the subject for sql server 2008 by itzik entity by julia lerman and the entity by anne boehm

 would totally depend on what i was if i was writing an application that targeted a large consumer i would probably stay away from something that required because of the size of the if i was writing a visual studio 2008 have no qualms about using something that required if i was writing an internal it would depend on the current desktop configuration and how open the it admin folks were to rolling out if it there you will probably need to as about a more concrete scenario to get a more concrete answer

 would want to migrate stuff that work in the transition from to 5 sure what that would but be wary of migrating stuff for the of you do take this some you have comprehensive test coverage if you should write unit tests for the code going to be you have components that are widely used within your codebase if they are probably candidates to be migrated in terms of their api using generics terms of widely used from java generics is important and makes your life a lot i see autoboxing nor enums is all varargs almost annotations are useful for but i consume i think ever implemented one

 writing to the 64 output be using many different memory if the bins are filled essentially at it means that sometimes have two bins that couls share the same cache not a big the core 2 l1 cache is that means get a problem only with the 9th cache with just 65 live memory references at any time associative is l2 cache is apparently associative so 12 that weird a so even if have collisions in chances are pretty good still not hitting main if you like the bins in instead of stroing each bin interleave for bin store chunks at offsets but store chunks at offset for bin store chunks at offsets this takes just a few bit shifts and but the result is that a pair of bins share 8 cache possible way to speed up your code in this case is especially in x64 get 16 registers x 128 and you can optimize the read to limit cache not sure if that will help a lot with the read though expect the core2 prefetcher to catch reading sequential integers is the most simple kind of access any prefetcher should optimize

 written an smtp client that sends with fine except that when an sent by my program is received by outlook it displays two attachments the file actually sent and a file with two characters cr and lf inside and this file has name done search found a lot of matches like for similar problems and checked everything i even more i compared two emails sent by my program and sent by opera and i deduce the however what opera sends is interpreted but what my program sends is what my program sends is interpreted by a set of other mail clients but not by to the smtp retrieved the two emails into a text file one from my another from and compared them i see any difference that could affect interpretation by an email a sample message file contents blank lines exactly as they appear in real lines never exceed 80 goes the base64 encoded text part it may be so better to utf8 it and do goes the base64 encoded file tried to play with linebreaks after the last boundary tried but this improve the there a set of some weird limitations that a mail client must follow to produce messages that are interpreted by outlook attachments when is received in

 wrong with the boost but the developer guidelines are a bit to relaxed once a library is in the developer can change he wants behavior and happened to me with where parts of the interface and just changed or simply dissapeared even a notice in the change similar thing happened with behavior recently the behavior was never precisely official answer is that you should view each boost version as a different the problem with that is that the bug fixes will almost never end up in the previous versions if the library versions quality of any boost library depends on the quality and dedication of and sometimes there are no being i still find some of the libraries genius and use then

 wrote a program to read an excel file and output to csv and unicode i wrote a separate program to remove blank this is accomplished by reading each line with and then going character by character through the string and not writing the line to output if it contains all commas the or all tabs the unicode problem occurs when the excel file contains embedded newlines inside the i changed my xls to csv converter to find these new lines it goes cell by and write them as and normal lines just use problem occurs in the separate program to remove blank when i read in with by definition it only returns the string with the not the since the embedded newlines show up as two separate i tell which is a full record and which is an embedded newline for when i write them to the final not even sure i can read in the because everything on the input registers as i could go character by but this destroys my logic to remove blank ideas would be greatly need to pick up line

 wrote my own library to work with facebook connect as i found the one provided to be very provide the code as it is company but a breakdown of what i needed to hopefully you can use it and fill in the blanks easily your application configure the the in my case is the root folder where my file under i marked my app as a web your file in the root folder specified there is a ton of documentation on out this is what facebook hits when the user logs it will write cookies to their browser which your application can read in later to do cookies facebook sets are in the format of where apikey is your apps api key and is the name of the need the cookie to make further api if this cookie is not you need to show the login button as desscribed in steps 4 otherwise skip to step need to load in the facebook javascript file on your page that you will have the fb login show the fb login facebook js will automatically render a facebook login button for it will trigger the method that you shall define once the user is logged in so you can do something after they below the above you need to call the fb init javascript to have it render the api key path to your file the as set in the cookie to make any api how to make api calls is well this	
 wrote quite complex shell scripts and my first suggestion is the reason is that is fairly easy to make a small mistake that hinders your or even make it i have other resources to pass you but my personal is what i normally which is but tends to be although your script accept long and short be careful because there are two commands to parse getopt and use getopt as you face less bash test echo exit set case shift shift echo unparseable option option exit test echo missing exit important point is that a program should always return zero if completes if something went can call functions in just remember to define them before the functions are like they can only return numeric this means that you have to invent a different strategy to return string my strategy is to use a variable called result to store the and returning 0 if the function completed you can raise exceptions if you are returning a value different from and then set two exception and the first containing the exception type and the second a human readable you call a the parameters of the function are assigned to the special vars i suggest you to put them into more meaningful declare the variables inside the function as foo local prone unless you declare an unset variable is used as an empty this is very dangerous in case of as the badly typed variable will not be and it will be evaluated as prevent this to be careful because if you do the program will abort every time you evaluate an undefined for this the only way to check if a variable is not defined is the test echo not can declare variables as can achieve modularization if you use the following getscriptabsolutedir used to get the script the script local local absolute path if the first character is a if test importer routine to get external the first location searched is the script if not search the module in the paths contained in environment the file to without if test echo unable to import unspecified exit if test echo undefined script absolute did you remove exit if test echo empty script exit if test import from script elif test import from the shell script library save the separator and use the local for path in if test restore the standard echo unable to find module exit can then import files with the extension with the following will be searched in as you always import in the global remember to prefix all your functions and variables with a proper otherwise you risk name i use double underscore as the python put this as first thing in your avoid double test return oriented you cannot do object oriented unless you build a quite complex system of allocation of objects thought about but you can however do oriented you have one instance of each and only i do i define an object into a module the modularization then i define empty vars to member an init function and member like in this example avoid double test return an example for module enum used in the mysql in this prefixed with bash variable cannot start with will contain the executed mysql command init the module with the database the mysql config if test already return local i am aware that i could put default parameters and other but i am lazy if test parameter config return mark the module as return gets the name of the person the row the if test not return if test parameter return local name from table where id if test 0 to perform return return and handling found this useful to catch and handle signal handler for echo signal handler for echo signal handler for end of the program or probably redundant we already call the cleanup in catch signals and exit int term and something does not work for some try to reorder the order is important and not always not even consider working with it does not support and horrible in it although please if you have to use the kind of things i wrote it means that your problem is too complex to be solved with use another i had to use it due to human factors and

 you are comparing operator overloading between java and you be talking about and java expose enough memory management detail for and need overload the other operators for pointer types at least one argument must be a class or enumerated so he be talking about providing different operators for operators in operate on values or const references to would be very unusual for operators which operator on values or const references to values to return anything other than a from obvious errors common to all functions returning a reference to a stack allocated object is the opposite of a memory or returning a reference to an object created with rather than a value is usually done no more than once in a career before being it would be hard to come up with a scenario where the common operators have memory there any need to create multiple versions depending on whether the operands are stack or heap allocated based on normal patterns of arguments to an operator are objects passed as either values or there is no portable mechanism in to test whether an object was allocated heap or if the object was passed by it will always be on the so if there was a requirement to change the behaviour of the operators for the two it would not be possible to do so portably in on many test whether the pointer to the object is in the space normally used for stack or the space normally used for but that is neither portable nor entirely even if you could have operators which took two pointers as no reason to believe that the objects are heap allocated just because they are that information simply exist in only duplication you get is for cases such as where the same operator is used as both an accessor and a then it is normal to have a const and a so you can set the value if the receiver is not that is a good thing not being able to mutate publicly accessible state objects which have been marked

 you expected anything a class gets a virtual it can no longer be a pod may not have been one before in which case this make a and that makes a whole range of optimizations on plain pod types can resort to a simple memcpy but types have to be handled more becomes a lot slower because the vtable has to be in the worst the difference in performance between pod and datatypes can be the worst you may see 5x slower execution number is taken from a university project i did recently to reimplement a few standard library our container took roughly 5x as long to construct as soon as the data type it stored got a in most unlikely to see any measurable performance this is simply to point out that in border it can be performance be your primary consideration everything virtual is not a perfect solution for other everything to be overridden in derived classes makes it much harder to maintain class how does a class guarantee that it stays in a consistent state when any one of its methods could be redefined at any everything virtual may eliminate a few potential but it also introduces new

 you happen to be in the then its a lot easier for an iphone developer to put their apps but if you are not from its a very frustrating especially if you are from a country which does not have its own happen to be from india and i have spent over 40 days just to ensure my card was i have faxed my docs over 7 times to usa and i must have emailed them over 30 times just to ensure my card was must have called their usa telephone number at least 5 and not even once did anyon e the answering machine keeps you on hold for over 30 long minutes and you finally have to disconnect coz you cant take it any more official email for dev support has never responded to a single email of thing to happen was i got an email from their australian office telling me my credit card was this was a big joke as my card has a balance of over 1500 usd and i use it all the time on american sites like amazon and i confirmed with my card bank hsbc and they said there was no attempt to charge my after many more phone calls and emails they charged the same card this time around its really surprising how it got rejected i am in the second phase to get a usa ein i have no clue how much more time apple would take just so that i can start selling my apps on the app i do not understand what on earth makes apple ask their developers to handle all these there are 100 other usa based companies which let u sell stuff online but you are isolated from all this legal way apple rejects app submissions is ridiculous the entire blogosphere has written stories of the they have no standard rules of rejecting your has to soon change the way its dealing with developers otherwise its not gonna take too much time for some other company to eat into its own reports suggest android is picking up market share right iphone is way ahead of the rest trust we live in a world today which is fast and least tolerant to such screw it wont take too much time for a google or for a microsoft or for couple of young smart college kids to roll their own version of the app store and kill app have been a microsoft developer for the last 8 and i have been hearing all sort of crap about of which perhaps is for a change i choose apple coz i sensed a big opportunity on the but so far its been very to microsoft has been a thousand times better than apple as far as developer support in india is no matter what people talk about the fact is on my own experience in last few no company matches microsoft when it comes to supporting their they make it super easy to download and preview their latest their documentation is top before the sdk comes the documentation is up and live on they have local groups in virtually every important city in india the worst policy apple has is as a you have to pay their payments are not on time to i can only hope apple realises that developers hold the key to getting mega bucks in the tech world

 you have a member initialized like it will be that is also true for for a every member is that and for an every element of it is for a scalar type like pointer or integer you will have it inialized to converted to the right so you will get null pointers or false or whatever type you have that the rule changed subtly from to we have right which can have surprising have that it said default initialization which for a type always meant default constructor but in has special meaning if there is no every element is is the a int but no user declared b a in you will be guaranteed that is while in will have some indeterminated	
 you have a member the dbml will most likely contain a member to update a member in the you will have to create a new member and the attach it to the something similar to the following code should the trick have not tested the context member m new userid userid set other must be called before setting the linq2sql has some issues with attach in the case where the properties of your object are set to default values 0 for numeric false for null for string in this case attach will not generate the correct	
 you have a mix of existing if or you mind converting existing i would standardize on i strongly prefer nunit over faster and it force you to have the testcontext nonsense in your test also more compatible with ci	
 you have a performance then you should not sacrifice readability for when choosing a way to implement some you should avoid using code you know is problematic from a performance point of so if there are 2 ways to implement a choose the one likely to perform but if not the most intuitive make sure you put in some comments as to why you coded it that	
 you have a pointer to a as a function parameter that you make a reference you can still make a reference to it matrix void operator int main matrix matrix r	
 you have a random or number even if not guaranteed to return unique you can implement one that returns unique values each time using this assuming that the upper limit remains constant you always call it with and call it with code check for you can add that yourself if you want also requires a lot of memory if you want a large range of the function returns a random number between 0 and max not necessarily i assume the function returns a unique random number between 0 and max 1 static int contains a list of numbers we returned static int 0 we started randomizing 1 we have started randomizing static int static initialize the if if list count max int for max i now choose one from the list int index int retval now we throw away the returned we do this by shortening the list by and replacing the element we returned the highest remaining when the count reaches 0 we start over if list else reduce the counter by 1 swap two numbers int int temp

 you may want to start looking into the php 5 exception remember though that just because something is new mean that you must adopt only adopt those features that you need and make sense in your being i feel that exceptions are a good concept to grasp and even if you decide not to adopt them you will be all the better for the would like to suggest that you read exceptions 5 has an exception model to that of other an exception can be and caught within code may be surrounded in a try to facilitate the catching potential each try have at least one corresponding multiple catch blocks can used to catch different classes normal execution exception is thrown within the or when a catch matching thrown class is will continue after that catch block defined in exceptions can be thrown within a catch would also encourage you to read is an this is a java tutorial but the concepts are an error occurs within a the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime the called an exception contains information about the including its type and the state of the program when the error creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an in order to implement a global exception handler in order to establish a default exception handler that will handle previously unhandled you will want to us the	
 you mean examples of then you need look no further than the talk about the input stream variant for the sake of but the same applies to output a look at for look at the arry and notice how at some point if calls which in turn reads from the underlying input around that it calls into the inflater to actually turn the buffer of bytes that it pulled from the underlying stream into the actual bytes that are written to the thing to consider is that filterinputstream is a little bit of a waste of so long as you can define your inputstream to take another underlying and in all the read you read from that underlying stream in mind that in theory you only need to define the byte then specifically making your class extend filterinputstream really buy you very for part of the code for an input stream that limits the number of bytes from the underlying stream that it allows the caller to read we can a stream into several which is useful when reading from archive for limitedinputstream extends inputstream private inputstream private long long public int throws ioexception if return int b return public int int int throws ioexception if return len int n if bytesleft return missed off boring implementations of this case in my it really buys me nothing to declare this class as a in a choice between wanting to call or to get the underlying

 you mean the message passing the best approach is to write the output strings to a buffer and send them to the rank 0 this process should be used not for doing the real work but just for filtering and outputting the output the other ranks to do the real i think your above solution will work because i is local to each also want to use the messaging to stop the individual ranks they can since they will be unable to do their sorting work in the have each rank 1 through n do work and send strings to rank the strings could be of the form where n is the rank and s is the rank 0 could then filter out specific messages or write different messages to different then combine them once all the working ranks had shut

 you need to be clear what a service do you mean a single or multiple endpoints in the same you mean a single then but with a little an endpoint can only implement a single so what you need to do is combine all the interfaces you want to implement into a single interface imyinterface then implement them all inside your implementation what you cannot do is have multiple interfaces and multiple implementations magically merge into a single

 you see why taking have and for each replace is iterating through the and making a new not an exact as any token found is replaced with the new token but for each token reading newing up of and writing can we think of a better way of doing how about instead of iterating the string for each we instead walk it walking create an empty output we walk the source if we find a jump characters and write out the obfuscated otherwise proceed to the next turning the process inside doing the for loop on the long and at each point looking for a to make this want quick for the so we put them into some sort of associative array see why it is taking long but not sure on the for each string on which i have 1 to 2 tokans i want to so character by character looking for of a thousand tokens what takes longest in up when we create a what likely happens is that some amount of space is allocated 64 and that whenever we append more than its current it doubles its and then copies the old character buffer to the new possible we can can and not have to if we start with 64 to get up to we allocate and then then then then then 2048 we do this twenty times to get up to and in getting allocated just to throw it by using something analogous to will at least let us do that all at but still all at once for at least producing a temporary string for if you have 2000 allocating about a 2 billion bytes of all to end up with each throwaway contains the transformation of the previous resulting with the current token why this is taking so deciding which token to apply at each also takes you may wish to use a regular which internally builds a state machine to run through all rather than a set as i suggested but really killing you is the time to allocate all that for 2000 copies of a gibson your tokens so you have look for a thousand tokens the sort would take but it would probably end being faster since you have search thousands of tokens was my reasoning behind putting them into an associative array java but the other problem is if one token is and another is if there are any common that how do we is where answer comes in he delegates the matching to a which is a great as a regex already defines and implements how to do once the match is we can examine then use a java map an associative to find the obfuscated token for the unobfuscated wanted to concentrate my answer on the not just how to fix but on why there was a problem in the first

 you sure that the problem is with and not the driver for the i would try another test to validate the up to your problem memory in same way that causes problem in memory usage and it does not then there is a bug in particular to if it happens you would at least know that it has nothing to do with the problem might be in either the com port code or in the driver you are i find it likelier that it the problem might be in the but love to know if there is some unknown issue with serial used before while ports without any such thing you can try to is debug into the there are plenty of other so questions on this so it should be easy to find the method to do that should let you debug down a bit further and see exactly at which point in the memory leak warning since it is a wrapper to the serial you might quickly see it go to world and will probably not get to see to

 you talking about if serialization is an extralingual object creation a backdoor that uses native code to create the object without calling any when designing a class for you need to make sure that a class created through deserialization maintains the same invariants fields being as you would through the constructor a third way to create objects in java is through and similar issues and serialization interact well with the use of final fields if you need to set the value of that field to something different than what is returned by clone or the deserialization has some chapters that explain these issues in more answer may apply to other languages but only used serialization in

 you think about using for this is quite easy to index just what you and you can also think about writing your own parser for specific files format that are not managed natively by you should really think about such a solution since lucene offers quite an easy api to query the it is quite well documented and you can find a lot of resources about it on the as your problematic can interest a lot of people perhaps it can be a good start for an project to create a personal search this can be challenging interesting for a huge amount of people i i chose this going to write an application that does exactly what is probably using i expect the two main problems to be selecting what to index only in the wikipedia and to index compressed files without unpacking them completely index while as soon as i release it add a link thanks for all your

 you use the input anything you put in the value attribute will be shown by want to make sure you do some sanitation on before outputting it into that just in for getting the values of your trying before your while and see if you can figure out going wrong with if it show anything maybe inside your while loop with a nice hr in between each this should give you a full view of exactly what is being returned in its entirety from your if is a bit too much information for check r

 you using any of the advanced features of jboss and you planning then probably better to go with a pure embedded this if a security fix is found in you can upgrade just the one single embedded component and move jboss is significantly larger and is thus more difficult to all you are using from jboss is jms or jndi or something else that is easily embeddable as a separate 3rd party component in then by all means drop jboss and move to just an embedded should you stick with when using jboss makes your life so much easier that the extra work of upgrading jboss is worth the this is true for many it sounds like it is not true in your far as integrating better with i expect that both integrate pretty well with i use which supports both jboss and so this may depend on what version of eclipse and what plugins you are

 you verified the program flow using i thinks more probable that your php code is the cause of this than the zend i would recommend putting a dump of the trace into a file at the start of each function and analysing that	
 you verify that i got the question table represents vectors identified by the every vector has a dimension of something between 100 and but there is no order defined on the that is a vector from the table is actually a representative of equivalence you define the similarity of two equivalence classes as the minimum euclidian distance of the projections of any two representative of the equivalence classes to the subspace of the first 30 for projection to two represents the following equivalence class of projection of all representative of this equivalence class to the first two dimensions represents a equivalence class with 720 the projection to the first two dimensions yields 30 the distance of a and b is the square root of because this is the minimum distance of two vectors from the for example and yield this am i right with my understanding of the really naive algorithm for n vectors with m components each would have to calculate for each distance the algorithm would calculate the distances of projection for each so for 100 dimensions lower there are possible projection for a this requires to calculate about distances between projections and finding the minimum to find the distance of two and then repeat this n hope that i misunderstood you or made a else this sounds something between really challenging and not i thought about is ordering the vector components and trying to match using manhattan distance if possible may help to simplify the

 you want a dead simple way to print data from a python script to a webpage and update you can just print from the for using apache with the below python cgi out random digits between 1 and 1000 i i i navigate to that in a browser know if other browsers might work differently with regards to buffering it prints the digits mind it prints in sequential order so the newer data is at the bottom rather than that but it might work depending on what exactly looking to this really what looking the only other way to do this is an automatic refreshing page in an or the whole or with javascript to do the data can use a meta refresh tag in your iframe or page html and your cgi can print the new data each time you can use javascript with an xmlhttprequest to read the new data in without a visual page

 you were doing this for a create a you mention so obviously working with the apple allow iphone applications to dynamically link against other libraries at so your only option is to create a static a static library is linked into the application executable when my no static library project template in what likely have to do is start with a different iphone xcode template and add a static library hang on to the default application you can use that to build a simple test application to make sure the library actually actually use the library in an need two the compiled library has a and all the header in your finished link against your static and need to the header files so that the compiler understands what are available to common technique is to create one header file that imports all the that you only need to import a single file in your source for creating your own custom a simple tutorial here that should get you you can probably copy the default templates and just customize them to suit your struct syntax looks like struct cgfloat cgfloat are are declared in header so you can click on the name of a struct to see how little trick for creating structs is to do something like apoint the compiler knows the order of fields in the it can very easily match up the values you provide in the curly braces to the appropriate of more convenient to have a function like so you can write that like cgfloat return y that this is a not a so it lives outside of any or although i think the compiler complains if you define it in an is defined as known as an you can see the definition for that in the cocoa header difference between an inline function and a normal function is that the compiler can replace a to with a of which avoids the overhead of making a function a pretty minor but for a function that it makes	
 you were just about to start out i recommend as a first because the first thing you need to understand as a programmer are the programming and in spend a lot of time wrangling with the since four months in and enjoying it then it sounds like you are doing so say carry but round it out with some more general something like and intepretation of computer it will teach you things that just ploughing throw in things that will make your programs better make you better in other languages as	
 you were to build your own car from it would probably be very expensive and quite but if you were to buy a ready made probably be a lot cheaper and be a lot more same is true of software of the every bit of bespoke code needs to not only be but also tested and if you can fit a product into the requirements it can generally be a more cost effective i think problems occur when a product is shoe horned into a set of requirments which demand something which it designed	
 you were to look at how a struct stores its it would be something like where your float is where your char is where your int is when you change the value of you are actually changing bytes when you change your you are actually changing byte when you change your you are actually changing bytes you now look at how a union stores its it would be something like where your float is where your char is where your int is when i change the value of i am changing bytes since c is stored in byte when you change you also change c and when you change changing part of f and a and when you change changing c and where your is when you pack the 3 values into the one memory not at just creating 3 different ways of looking at and changing the same you really have an a and a char in that union at the physical just got 32 which could be viewed as an a or a changing one is to change the if you want them to change each then use a is why gcc tells you that your struct is 9 bytes while your union is only 4 not saving space just that structs and unions are not the same	
 you were using oracle then advise benchmarking three table with primary key table hash represents a very vanilla approach really the lowest common but could mean logical reads to get each with one of those being a probable physical read of the table if it is not completely will save you one of those logical read by avoiding the probe to a separate table but might not save you the physical read because the iot segment will be larger and harder to cache than the index will potentially get you the row with a single logical but unless you have the entire table cached probably going to translate into a physical is highly

 your other i guess you want to learn a new language to get new my advice is that the language is not really what is important is the quality of its community but also existing code you can read and learn and the available in this i think the is not the best choice for web libraries and frameworks are not portable and not and coding style of code you can study varies a lot and may confuse you a c is my favorite would advise to just learn and try to really understand the concept of then move to other languages more adapted to the web or javascript comes to mind or even in the c has the best mix of power and simplicity in my but is a niche

 your question indicates for it really seems to be focusing on use of these for can have no state or class that implements an interface must provide an implementation of all the methods of that classes may contain state implementation classes can be inherited without implementing the abstract methods such a derived class is abstract may be abstract classes may not is probably the key concrete reason for interfaces to exist separately from abtract classes they permit an implementation of multiple inheritance that removes many of the problems of general general oo the differences are not necessarily for there are programmers who may hold similar rigid definitions are a strict subset of abstract classes that cannot contain while some may say that an abstract class with some default implementations is still an interface or that a class can still define an there is a idiom called the interface where the public methods are methods that to private virtual	
 your question it is unclear if you want to be able use the class without an identity or if calling the method requires you to create an instance of the this depends on whether you want the printinformation member to write some general information or more specific about the object you want to use the class creating an the members of that class should be using this keyword you tell the compiler that you want to be able to call the method without having to create a new instance of the static void you want the class have an you first need to an so that the class has an once that is done you can use the object his in the case that you want to use m new you know when to use read summary in this overflow note that in the current case you would not need a	
 your scenario it seems that the actual creation of the object is being performed inside your so your first sample would be the correct your is stored in the and your is simply a reference to that new when you set listcustclass to the reference pointer of is discarded and replaced with a reference pointer to whatever returns be when this happens your original is still in the but no objects point to so its just wasting resources until the garbage collector comes around and cleans it sum it up everytime you create a new object then abandon like the second essentially wasting memory by filling the heap with useless

 your solution you can force markets to reference only distributors this table customers serial primary check in unique key table markets serial primary int not check foreign key references customers foreign key can reference a primary key or a unique key in the referenced note that if you have attributes that are irrelevant to putting them in the table would violate normal that the relevance of these distributor attributes would depend on the value in which is not part of the primary in third normal every attribute must depend on nothing but the primary this i would choose the second making a child referencing put attributes into the then the table can reference more	
 your standard way of debugging a this might seem like a pretty broad question with some of you replying depends on the but i think a lot of us debug by instinct and actually tried wording our why we say was sort of forced to word my process recently because a few developers and i were working an the same problem and we were debugging it in totally different i wanted them to understand what i was trying to do and vice some reflection i realized that my way of debugging is actually quite first try to be able to reliably replicate the problem on my local then through a series of elimination this is where i think problem try to identify the other guys were trying to do it in a totally different just wondering what has been working for you guys out and what would you say your process is for debugging if you had to formalize it in we still found out our problem methods of

 your tests are incorrect because floating point numbers do not behave like you probably expect them particularly things like are has been nice enough to provide this paper every computer scientist should know about floating point is exactly as depending on your background it will be an easy read or a big of but it really is worth the time for any programmer using not suggesting that every programmer will easily understand everything in that reading over it though will at the very least give a better idea of what floats actually what the issues and some hints on how to handle things you want to do a lot of numerical work going to have to read up on the various but that would be a textbook worth of the comments here have already pointed out some of the and linked to
