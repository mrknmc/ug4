150k rows per the size of a these rows contain redundant data that you might be able to minimize by just keeping generall always a good thing to keep tables small so that index updates go through as mentioned by ben s above your queries should be optimized at least so that no access to columns with missing you can find some possible issues using explain and in the slow query log of your mysql server if got it thing that might help you with performance issues is the memcached using it you can delay writes to your thereby taking out some of the steam and still suffer from dirty caches and though depending on the application framework using any at it requires some work to implement this into your archiving and statistics purpose i suggest you take a look at infobright an open source mysql drop in replacement on designated purpose is to be a data warehouse you can use it for all sorts of data analysis got a very nice compression that in our case reduces of raw data to about compressed i guess needless to say that querying specific rows of compressed data be quite but for statistics pretty darn so if not querying specific rows but instead analyze things like many rows got updated with value foo bar between dec 08 and feb it will give you very good in as you use the db it will analyze your usage and create a knowledge grid that will optimize data for your specific next question that would come to my mind if data that keeping for a or some is a relational db the right tool for the knowing the exact nature of your application i could imagine some sort of sessions could reside in a terracotta cluster for that write a transaction log and commit their data every so often might be better but as i that depends heavily on your nature and the ammount of data in

2 years of building highly optimized java code that to be optimized that i would say that there is a rule that governs on the of your development because you have to do it countless times single time you have to amend your just when you have had it of your development time do it only back to it and optimizing when too of your development because you have to plunge yourself back into the i would come to the conclusion that there is a right time and a right way to do it entity by entity by if you have classes that have a well defined job to and can be tested and test make sure the logic is optimize just and forget about that implementation details

a default sql server listens on by this can be on a named unless configured sql server listens on a dynamic tcp what that means is should sql server discover that the port is in it will pick another tcp how clients usually find the right port in the case of a named instance is by talking to the sql server listener that listens on and cannot be if you have a named you can configure a static port and if you have a need to use kerberos you need to determine is what port your sql server is listening then need to get with your folks to determine if they allow communication to that port via if they as check your firewall some systems have multiple firewalls laptop is an if need to check all the firewalls on your all of those are verify the server have an ipsec policy that restricts access to the sql server port via ip that also could result in you being brian

a i have bought into the tdd philosophy and take the effort to make extensive unit tests for any nontrivial code i sometimes this road can be painful changes causing cascading multiple unit test high amounts of scaffolding but on the whole i refuse to program without tests that i can run after every and my code is much less buggy as a been playing with and resident testing in a fashion distinctly different from quickcheck has an emphasis on testing invariants of the that certain properties that hold over all substantive of a quick a stable sorting algorithm should give the same answer if we run it should have increasing should be a permutation of the quickcheck generates a variety of random data in order to test these seems to at least for pure functions functions without side if you do mocking correctly you can convert dirty functions into pure that invariant testing could supplant unit testing as a strict superset of those each unit test consists of an input and an output imperative programming the is not just the return of the function but also any changed but this can be one could conceivably created a random input generator that is good enough to cover all of the unit test inputs that you would have manually created then because it would it would generate cases that you have thought if you find a bug in your program due to some boundary you improve your random input generator so that it generates that case is whether or not possible to formulate useful invariants for every say it a lot simpler once you have an answer to see if correct than it is to calculate the answer in the first thinking about invariants also helps clarify the specification of a complex algorithm much better than ad hoc test which encourage a kind of thinking of the you could use a previous version of your program as a model or a version of a program in another you could cover all of your former without having to explicitly code an input or an i gone or am i on to invariant testing replace unit

a i think all missed the collection classes are not if the collection is being accessed by multiple threads without then you need to fix a particularly insidious problem because it will work correctly or throw a predictable of the and of the time it will do something totally unpredictable and nearly impossible to simple approach is to use statements around every place where any code accesses the that may be slight overkill but it is the safest for iteration you can either put a lock around the whole loop or if you want to block out other threads that just lock it long enough to make a snap x in

a interface the controller handles the inputs from things like the keyboard and choosing which views to render and what changes to make in the model based on those the view and model can be more closely related because the view can register callbacks directly with the model entities to be notified of changes and thus be updated based on changes to the model directly instead of being updated by the the web views are necessarily more decoupled from the it must act through the controller actions because it has no direct access being rendered and delivered to the to the the controller takes a larger role in this environment even though the only it has to deal with are browser in a the coupling that used to occur with the view in mvc is transferred to the controller acting on its since there are no callbacks from the model to respond to forget about technologies for more business code is incorporated into the controller since the natural place to model business though perhaps not

a single wcf service endpoint be set up to authenticate against multiple authentication if username and password supplied check custom otherwise try windows have wcf service a which is injected with a client proxy to wcf service service b could have a dependency on service c user request to service a comes in and is authenticated using a custom and a is built using a custom implementation of authentication succeeds and the service operation on a is this operation makes a call to service b via the injected service b request then goes through the stack but fails because no credentials have been as service a called service b i trust it so want the authorization to succeed without having to pass around the user name and password of the original it is possible that service b can be called directly by a user with a username and so it must support both methods of wcf endpoint request though multiple

a team of sql servers database our clients are a mixed bag of and java web services and some client developers only use stored procedures that we provide and we expect that of they treat them like web service our client developers like sql they understand them in their languages but they appreciate that the sql is limited in how we can communicate just mean sql such as trying to insert into a int also mean exceptions such as telling them that a reference value is or that data has already or they do this because his aggregate is not really have any concrete mentioned that we should output but we assume an exception means do folks here handle the either generally or where there is separation between the db and client code use sql server 2005 log all errors after the rollback to an exception table concerned that some of our clients check output paramaters and assume everything is we need errors flagged up for support to look is an the clients are expected to do some message parsing to separate information vs to separate our exceptions from db engine and calling they should use the error number are all of server error exceptions and the

a to something that has a to the original you can use to break this of add the following as an example of what i am talking about in the node public void void void if void this you have a tree of each of which holds a pointer to its the member for whatever ripples upwards through the is not entirely some gui frameworks work this problem is if you lose reference to the topmost then the topmost node still holds strong references to its and all its children also hold a strong reference to their this means that there are circular references keeping all the instances from cleaning themselves while there is no way of actually reaching the tree from the this memory node public void void void parent if void now a the parent node has been replaced by a weak it no longer has a say in the lifetime of the node to which it if the topmost node goes out of scope as in the previous then while it holds strong references to its its children hold strong references to their thus there are no strong references to the and it cleans itself in this causes the children to lose their one strong which causes them to clean and so in this wont and just by strategically replacing a with a

a tree is just a special type of graph called a directed acyclical so first and depth first traversal both work on a could write out a detailed explanation of the differences between breadth and depth first but probably get it wrong not a heavy guy it to say that the only difference between breadth and depth first traversal is the order in which you process the breadth first you can think of as adding vertices to a depth first you can think of as adding the vertices to a when it comes time to process the vertices been added to their respective data you dequeue or pop the stack to get the next vertex to clever versions of depth first traversal use recursion to process the vertices instead of adding them to a have no idea whether this was helpful or quick google search know whether it was breadth or depth finds which seems pretty good at describing the differences between bfs and i can also recommend steve algorithm design if you want to get a more in depth

a type parameter is one which is allowed to vary down as the class is subtyped vary with hence the more is a subtype of because is a subtype of this means that you may provide an instance of when a value of type is this is really a very intuitive way for generics to but it turns out that it is unsound the type when used in the presence of mutable this is why generics are invariant in brief example of unsoundness using java arrays are erroneously arr new just assigned a value of type to an array of type for reasons which should be this is bad type system actually allows this at compile the jvm will throw an at type system prevents this problem because the type parameter on the class is invariant is rather than that there is another type of variance known as this is very important as it explains why covariance can cause some contravariance is literally the opposite of parameters vary with it is a lot less common partially because it is so though it does have one very important def the variance annotation on the type this declaration as a whole means that is contravariant in and covariant in we can derive the following that must be a subtype the same of whereas it is the opposite for and in this can be read as the function is a subtype of another function if the parameter type of is a supertype of the parameter type of while the return type of is a subtype of the return type of reason for this rule is left as an exercise to the reader think about different cases as functions are like my array example from your knowledge of and you should be able to see why the following example will not def problem is that is while the function expects its type parameter to be is varying the wrong interestingly we could solve this problem by making contravariant in but then the return type would be invalid as the function expects its return type to be only two options here are to make losing the intuitive properties of or add a local type parameter to the method which defines as a lower is now you can imagine that is varying but is able to vary upward with respect to since is its with this method we can have be covariant and everything works that this trick only works if we return an instance of which is specialized on the type if you try to make things break down since you end up trying to assign values of type to a variable of type which is disallowed by the whenever you have you need to have a mutator of some which requires a method parameter of a certain which with the implies covariance works with immutable data since the only possible operation is an which may be given a covariant return

a very good rule that i came across a while an exception when a method do what its name says it idea is that an exception indicates that something has gone when you are implementing a it is not your responsibility to be aware of whether it will be used correctly or whether the code using your method catches the exception or not is not your but the responsibility of the person using your rule to follow catch an exception unless you know what you want to do with you should include cleanup code in a but you should never just catch an exception just for the sake of catching and you should never swallow exceptions while there are occasions when you may want to catch all exceptions by doing catch in these are fairly uncommon and generally have a very specific technical for when you are using threads in or if an exception escapes from your it will cause the entire application domain to in these at the very minimum you should log the exception details as an error and provide an explanation in the

a your second take is the correct way of doing are you sure that the relation you sketched in your first take i would not be as but you know your domain better than op added a i really believe photos should ever belong to more than one event events are photo each photo is by definition from a certain and view by event is the only way to browse the pretty confident is are several lessons in that so i wanted to edit this to underline those the most important is that you model a schema without knowing two the real problem domain being what our solution requires of the initial guess was that the events and pictures were modeling the of photos at as in an art gallery a gallery of pictures on a web in that the ansel adams online gallery might very well have in which ansel adams photos are titled mature photos of or photos of all three events might include the lines in the mohave since many photos could be shown in many need a the is a and as the op any one photo is taken in one and ony one photo lesson here is that we model can only model until we know the problem also suggest that the table name be to make this ore calling it a or makes it more clear what we are the comment provides an answer to his objection that having an event fk in a photo is the op pretty astutely realizes that this avoid a and it forces the relationship to a instead of a join is an implementation the correct relationship is more as it is a modeling he should also realize is that in our and in the problem it makes sense to ask of a what photo was this photo and why not which session is a legitimate question about or attribute of a and the fk provides the answer to that it also means that in this the fk from photo to event be a photo have an a photo or else there could be no are a couple of additional lessons about what it means to have a a relationship or a and what it means to to make an fk nullable or leve those to another

actually like using and feel they can be very useful for making logical groupings in a for example i had a class with various derivatives which certain methods corresponded to different things child object splitting these up into regions makes it clearer where things and can give you a good overview if you have appropriately named could split these into partial like the designer class but ultimately that reaches a very similar and you have a lot more class files that need to name can also use but some of the projects working searching is and much better if you can learn your way around the and find things quickly than having to wait for a time consuming have also used them within a few algorithms for understanding and honestly i think advocate this and always better to split things up into but that so easy with the algorithms that working therefore breaking it up into logical and then adding more comments detail within the regions seemed the best bet to me at the and honestly is taking a modular approach to you have a with a description of what it you have regions within the method that explain what that section of code does and then you can go down to individual lines of code which may also be so it helps you to drill down to get more information quickly and think are fine for logical grouping in i think they can work in but should be avoided if splitting code into more methods is the most suitable

actually working on an extensibility framework to use on top of my extensibility framework is based on the famous ioc structuremap use case trying to fulfill is create an application that should have some basic functionality that can be extended for every customer there should only be one instance of the application hosted but this instance can be adapted for every customer without making any changes to the core was inspired by the article on multi tenacy written by ayende source of inspiration was the book of eric evans on domain driven my extensibility framework is based on the repository pattern and the concept of root to be able to use the framework the hosting application should be build around repositories and domain the repositories or domain objects are bind at runtime by the is simply an asselmbly that contains controllers or repositories or domain objects that respects a specific naming the naming convention is every class should be prefixed by the customerid extend an application you copy a assembly in the extension folder of the when a user request a page under the customer root folder framework check if there is a for that particular customer and instantiate the custom classes otherwise it loads the default the custom classes can be controllers repositories or domain this approach enables to extend an application at all from the database to the through the domain you want to extend some existing features you create a an assembly that contains subclasses of the core when to create totally new functionalities you add new controllers inside the these controllers will be loaded by the mvc framework when the corresponding url is if you want to extend the ui you can create a new view inside the extension folder and reference the view by a new or subclassed controller modify existing behavior you can create new repositories or domain objects or sub classing exiting the framework responsibility is to determine which repository domain object should be loaded for a specific advise to have a look at structuremap and especially at the registry dsl features is the code i use at the startup of the application to register all or domain void also use an extensionfactory inheriting from the this factory is responsible to load the extension objects or domain you can plugin your own factories by registering them at startup in the void new framework as a fully operational sample site can be found

adding the nsurlrequestreloadignoringlocalandremotecachedata parameter you are instructing the local cache and any proxy servers which may handle the request between your client and the target server that they are not to return their own version of the response i think the here is that the remotecache is likely to be a proxy and you are just identifying that the request should always reach the real server and not a proxied the parameter you are inferring that your application already has a previous copy of the request and so is only interested in actually receiving data from the server if it has that is why you are getting a response of not from the behaviour does seem as you are explicitly instructing the client not to use its own which would imply that you would want to discard anything in there and certainly not use it as a reference for any subsequent i believe the advanced cache parameters are provided to allow the developer to handle their own level of be notified if data been updated on the server so they can avoid needless

advantage of anonymous inner classes is that no one can ever use it anywhere whereas a named inner class can be used only by the class that created it if made a small but it does mean that you can protect an inner class from being accidentally used using the anonymous inner class gives anyone reading your code a up class is being used just here and nowhere if you see a named inner someone might think be used in multiple places in the are very so neither point is a i just think it helps for clarity if you use anonymous inner classes for and named inner classes when used multiple times within the

advice do only even consider beta on a brickable development a few reasons beta in the traditional sense the google so not done but not all the new features are complete or functioning right and all subject to a one way you go now clever hackers have figured out difficult ways to downgrade and you may be able to work through or all software in the app store is ready to run on there seems to be some bugs in mediaplayer at the in other not completely backward compatible so reports are that facebook and other popular apps are there will be more beta releases so be prepared to spend time with more bug and potentially a dead in the beta cycle there was a period of time where the beta expired and there was no new release available shutting down devices for a upgrade your only device to unless you love skating away on the thin ice of a new that in the dev program and have on a touch and it will make many many happy developers and ever more happy and only scratched the surface of the new	
advice for your issues is general because i do not know the specifics of the platform you are working your i see two distinct web presentation layer be it will require custom spacing and even custom do not fool yourself that this will not be this is one of the biggest mistakes people make initially when internationalizing web you will need another style for the if you are using a template approach you can put most of your language content right in the the description of your it sounds like you will also need to handle localized error there is two approaches two you can have a language file where you localize when the error is thrown using a resource file another approach is to have your error messages use a common identifier and parameters and have another layer catch the message and localize i myself prefer the former solution since it is remember that if you are writing your error messages to a log that the error messages are in a language that the developers can likewise for errors displayed to users in the you will want some way for the users to identify the errors to the developers who do not speak the this could be done by using numbers i prefer using short keys like

all sound like discrete actions and thus not particularly restful in typically i will have a list action with filtering this filtering could be done via ajax since what it is returning is basically the same clicking on a particular item might bring me to a details view with an edit i might also include an edit button in the in which case clicking it would bring me to an details page in edit and edit would all be different and have different clicking the list button in view or edit would return me to the list clicking the save button in edit would return me to the view for that item this provides confirmation that the item has been errors in edit render the edit view with appropriate rule of thumb is to use ajax when the context of the view but a full request when a new action is this helps to keep the interface of you can do it any way you but mvc makes doing restful urls easier and restful urls make it easier for the user to bookmark a page to get back to it easily precisely because they map to a particular action on a particular data

all your javascript into one external file can do this dynamically and save the cached that that file use the mtime of a preconfigured file for the file if the client supports a far futures expires header on the referring to ajax libraries is another way to handle this that falls under the heading of a cdn delivery the idea being that the file is stored in multiple plallllces and the client will download the closest that result will be hard or just awkward to combine with other techniques and found that doing multiple external loads this way completely erodes any perceived benefit your only external so i use the method listed above	
allocation simply means not allocating a resource until it is actually this is common with singleton but strictly any time a resource is allocated as late as you have an example of lazy delaying allocation of a resource until you actually need you can decrease startup and even eliminate the allocation entirely if you never actually use the in you could a resource you expect to need which can make later execution more efficient at the expense of startup and also avoids the possibility of the allocation failing later in program following code provides an example of a class widget private widget public static widget if singleton new return private note that this code in most access to the method should be synchronized in some similar perhaps more concept is

already checked out the question and it quite go far enough to assist me with this have a table of approximately address locations hosted on a 2000 this table has a huge problem with duplicate data in the table caused by invalid input from various parties over the i need to output a list of duplicate records so i can begin the long process of cleaning them consider the following table companyid not null constraint primary companyname companyaddress companycity companystate companyzip datecreated lastmodified lastmodifieduser the first parse not even going to worry about typos and variations of spelling yet which is going to be a greater nightmare down the road that i even got the first clue about solving for this part a record is considered to be duplicate when multiple records match on the following or and companycity and is excluded because so many of the locations are missing codes and so many are entered incorrectly that it just makes for a far less accurate report if i include realize that there may legitimately be multiple locations for a company within a single instance just off the top of my and there may legitimately be multple companies at a single address within a city and state instance inside a shopping mall or office but for now we will consider that these at least warrant some level of human attention and will include them in the on single fields are a piece of but coming unstuck when i get to multiple especially when some are do i extract duplicate records from a table using multiple

also worth noting that some programs behave differently when run by a user at the command vs being part of a batch from another the actual difference is whether a terminal attached to the spawn part of the expect extension to sets things up so the executed program sees itself as run by a and then adds functionality to allow the tcl program to interact with the external program in a convenient way matching output via regular expressions and branch off those things run via spawn are run exec command is a core tcl command that runs the other returning it does not do any of the complicated setup that spawn but can be very handy for just running a program and seeing output return things run by exec by run but an ampersand at the end of the command causes it to be run in the background like traditional shell open while generally used to can also be used to run external by preceding the command name with the pipe you tell it to run an external and gain access to file descriptors to interact with the resulting this is sort of a middle ground between exec and with much more interaction with the process but without the complicated environmental setup that spawn it can be extremely handy for interacting with programs that require input but are still fairly well setup for

am looking for a specific hashcode that has the following i dont know of any such hashcodes and i dont know if it is possible to do such a just wanted to put it out there and see what people have two databases used term dont think of sql or anything of that one master and one there is a need to keep the two databases in sync and to detect when the databases are not in instead of verifying every data in it would be preferable to keep some hashcode that can be but the two databases dont necessarily share every since changes from master to backup are it is possible that certain modifications from the master to backup are lets say current state of database has elements and now b gets modified such that and then later the only change that will get sent from master to backup is the intermediate is instead of looping over every element in each database to verify that they we would prefer to keep a running hash code of the elements in both the locations and then just compare the hashcode would have to compute something previous hashcode of hm1 b changes hm2 hm3 master will have hashcode of now backup will not receive the modification so if it computes a running hash it will be like hb1 hb2 we want hb2 and hm3 to as the current state of the databases are the but most not hashcodes dont work this what we would want then is that we would want to the contribution of from the hash first and then the contribution of and then remove contribution of and add the contribution of into the hash so we want something like f modifies existing hashcode by adding contribution of a new while g modifies existing hashcode by removing contribution of an b gets modified to b get modified to is the new hashcode for the current state of the database b gets modified to hm5 and hb3 should as the current state of both databases is the are there such algorithms f and i hope i made the question function with reversible

am working on a few php projects that use mvc and while they all have different ways of retrieving objects from the it always seems that nothing beats writing your sql queries by hand as far as speed and cutting down on the number of one of my web projects by a junior executes over 100 queries just to load the home the reason is that in one a method will load an but later on deeper in the it will load some other that are related to the first leads to the other part of the question which is what are people doing in situations where you have a table that in one part of the code only needs the values for a few and another part needs something right now the same there is one method for each and it does a lists all the columns in the table so that anytime you need the object for any you get the whole in other you hear all the talk about how select is but if you try to use a orm class that comes with the it wants to do just that are you stuck to choosing orm with select vs writing the specific sql queries by it just seems to me that stuck between convenience and and if i hand write the if i add a most likely going to have to add it to several places in the for the long but explaining the background to get some mindsets from other developers rather than maybe a specific i know that we can always use something like but i would rather optimize what we can before getting into for any is a good balance in an mvc model to have efficient data

anyone have any suggestions for a best practice or preferred way of rolling back database transactions made from an integration test framework such as is our current we have a web project with a number of unit tests which work fine in our unit test environment each test inherits a parent class which opens a transaction in the and rolls back the transaction in the after each our unit test database is restored back to the original things change once we get to our integration our continuous integration server automatically compiles our commits and pushes them out to a test so that the server always runs on the most up to date also setup a selenium instance to automate user interaction with the the selenium tests basically communicate with an existing selenium and tell the server things a browser and go to enter text into form field with id assert new page contains text test is run in a similar manner to our vanilla unit but with an important any changes made by selenium are done in a completely different and therefore we we at roll them back in the test yet to come to a good solution for right now at a point where using a sqlcommand to execute a sql statement to backup the then at the end of the setting the database to single dropping the current and restoring the old copy this is less than because that effectively kills the application that was attached to the and requires us to yet again the this a problem that has been solved any advice would be database after integration

anyone we have a sql server 2005 database installed its an sql server 2000 attached to an sql server 2005 with the default server language language usa with dateformat like and we really need to keep it this way but currently just uploaded a new database to the server and this needs to have the dateformat for i force a change just on a database and not the whole if i force the change on the whole server it will make all my other apps example currently we have this sql statement which from sesiones where of course we can add this which now from sesiones where the problem being is that there are a large number of sql statements within the the truth being is that the application is fairly old and we really want to make any changes to the source hence if we could force a a change just on the database the tables of specific database then this would help really dateformat on a sql server db and not on whole server to

appear to be using a rather narrow definition would i be right in presuming that you define encapsulation to data with wrong then please ignore the rest of this is not a loose in defined by the international organisation for the reference model of open distributed processing defines the following five any concrete or abstract thing of a model of an an object is characterised by its behaviour by its an a collection of actions with a set of constraints on when they may an abstraction of the behaviour of an object that consists of a subset of the interactions of that object together with a set of constraints on when they may the property that the information contained in an object is accessible only through interactions at the interfaces supported by the can further make a as some information is accessible via these some information must be hidden and inaccessible within the the property such information exhibits is called information which parnas defined by arguing that modules should be designed to hide both difficult decisions and decisions that are likely to see one of the great computing important to note that it is not only the data that is it is some subset of behaviour associated with the object that is difficult or likely to your you seem to be saying that the difference between encapsulation in oo and in functional programming stems from data but at least according to the iso and data management is not the key to so i see why encapsulation in functional programming need be any different from that in in your post that functional programming provides by the methods rather than the data i is a difference of scale rather than of if i use the rather please let me know if then you seem to find significance in encapsulation by object and functional encapsulation by by the iso definition an object is anything i wish to thus classes may be encapsulated within a so long as some of those classes contribute to the interface the public classes of the and some are private classes in the the same methods are encapsulated within a class some methods being public and some you can even take this a notch lower and say that mccabian sequential sequences of code are encapsulated within each forms a graph of nodes encapsulated within encapsulated and all these graphs form a graph thus functional programming may well encapsulated at the but this is no different from the graph of and essentially no difference from the graph of oo note that word parnas uses information hiding concerns potential such as the changing of difficult design decisions in the you ask where encapsulation is certainly a strength of but the question then does strength and the answer is one of resounding change encapsulation reduces the maximum potential burden of concept is useful itself is defined measure of the strength of association established by a connection from one module to in another of great as the paper in words never since connections between modules also minimizes the paths along which changes and errors propagate into other parts of the thus eliminating where changes in one part cause errors in necessitating additional changes giving rise to new defined there are two limitations which can easily be coupling does not measure and these connections can give rise to just as effects as connections paper does to relate but this is not defined in terms of connections between elements references to labels or with which coupling was the coupling of any computer program is a in that modules are connected there is little scope within the definition of coupling to manage the potential changes of which parnas these issues are to some with the concept of potential the maximum possible number of connections formable among all elements of a in for a class that is default within a package cannot have connections formed on it no outside classes can depend on reflection but a public class within a package can have dependencies on this public class would contribute to the potential coupling even if no other classes depend on it at the moment classes might depend on it in when the design see consider the principle of the principle of burden takes two strong form states that the burden of transforming a collection of entities is a function of the number of entities the weak form states that the maximum potential burden of transforming a collection of entities is a function of the maximum potential number of entities burden of creating or modifying any software system is a function of the number of classes created or modified we presuming an oo and are concerned with encapsulation at the we could equally have concerned ourselves with the level of functional that is modern software development is usually or or that depend on a modified class have a higher probability of being impacted than classes that do not depend on the modified maximum potential burden a modified class can impose is the impacting of all classes that depend on the dependencies on a modified class therefore reduces the probability that its update will impact other classes and so reduces the maximum potential burden that that class can is little more than a of the maximum potential number of dependencies between all classes in a system therefore reduces the probability that an impact to a particular class will cause updates to other and thus reduces the maximum potential burden of all by reducing the maximum potential number of dependencies between all therefore mitigates the weak form of the principle of this is all covered which attempts to mathematically prove such using potential coupling as the logical means of structuring a that when you encapsulation the key to all worthwhile the answer must surely there is no single key to all worthwhile encapsulation in certain merely a tool to help improve the quality of code so that it may also write encapsulation can be a barrier to flexible extension of an yes it most certainly it is indeed designed to be a barrier against extending the design decisions of an object that are difficult or likely to this is thought to be a bad an alternative approach would be to have all classes public and have a program express its maximum potential but then the weak form of the principle of burden states that updates will become increasingly these are the costs against which barriers to extension are to be you make the interesting comparison between encapsulation and and in your semantics are its greater no semanticist either even know such a word existed before the good mister ramsey alluded to it in his but i presume you in the sense or an interpretation of the of a and very basically that a class with method should be called a is great strength indeed in this is curious to me is that you pit semantics against encapsulation and look for a i doubt find my there are two forces that motivate the semantic and the encapsulation merely means encapsulation based on the meaning of the nodes use the general so if i tell you that i have two one and one called and then give you three classes cat and goat and ask into which packages these classes should be given no other you would be perfectly right to claim that the semantics of the system would suggest that the three classes be encapsulated within rather than other motivation for is and particularly the study of potential mentioned encapsulation theory actually provides equations for the number of packages that should be used to encapsulate a number of classes in order to minimise the potential encapsulation as a whole is the between this semantic and logical allow the potential coupling of my programs to rise above the minimum if this makes the program semantically easier to but enormous and wasteful levels of potential coupling will be a warning that my program needs to be no matter how semantically obvious it if the good mister ramsey is still could you or your semanticist friends give me a better word for phase using it would be good to use a more appropriate

approaches always though not as elegant as just use after a you just get to know which hex digits represent which bit use constants and or or add for example need qualifiers on the bit patterns to make them unsigned or b0 b1 b31 long x b2 if performance critical and readability is you can just do it at runtime with a function such as as a sneaky you could write a that goes through your files and creates the ones by replacing all strings with their equivalent i do this lightly since all sorts of tricky combinations of syntax you may have to worry but it would allow you to write your string as you want to without having to worry about the vagaries of the and you could limit the syntax trickiness by careful the next step after that would be patching gcc to recognize constants but that may be an overkill

are about solving it matter whether talking about the tools in a wood shop or a what impressed me about rails still is that it was extracted from framework used to build web apps and has repeatedly been improved by people who extended or changed it after using it to build web it was no mere academic of the specific problems it started if you are looking to get a web application underway what better choices could you have than a framework that specifies an existing directory structure based on with lots of code and choices already for you as to components like javascript testing you may not agree with all the choices but you can assume them and have something that will work for or more of projects and swap out something later if you have a term migrations give you ways to move data forward as your code something that happens in any yet most frameworks do not account for that at separating all of the parts of your application into a directory hierarchy already setup with areas for again aids the long term maintenance of your human configuration files give you extra opportunities for human logical once learned can avoid mistakes like the classic mistyped file name or class name in a configuration file of different modes of rails has built in support for the idea of having a different set of settings for development test real apps have this but often the framework around them accommodate it and you end up having to swap configuration files in and out to achieve the same effect human error several things mentioned above embrace and encourage good programming practices standardized project but rails is often explicit in encouraging them and not just for evidence of that you need look no further than its built in support for test driven

are at least two important of is based on the unicode standard for and sorts accurately in a very wide range of comes very close to correct unicode sorting in many common but has a number of inaccuracies in some languages making in unsuitable for correct sorting in those is faster at comparisons and because it takes a bunch of uses a much more complex comparison algorithm which aims for correct sorting according in a very wide range of this makes it slower to sort and compare large numbers of defines complex sets of rules for how characters should be these rules need to take into account not everybody sorts their characters in what we would call far as latin languages there is not much difference between the unicode sorting and the simplified sorting in but there are still a few the unicode collation sorts like and like as people using those characters would normally whereas sorts them as single characters like and such as asian languages or languages with different there may be a lot differences between unicode sorting and the simplified the suitability of will depend heavily on the language for some be quite unicode characters are defined as which means they count toward the sort order and the comparison should move on to the next character handles these should you is almost never any reason to use as we have left behind the point where cpu speed is low enough that the performance difference would be your database will almost certainly be limited by quite other bottlenecks than this the difference in performance is only going to be measurable in extremely specialised and if already know about if experiencing slow in almost all cases be an issue with your changing your collation function should not be high on the list of things to i originally wrote this answer 4 years i said that if you you could use most of the and only use when sorting was going to be important enough to justify the performance the performance cost is no longer really relevant it may not have been back more important to sort properly in whichever language your users are other thing add is that even if you know your application only supports the english it may still need to deal with which can often contain characters used in other languages in which it is just as important to sort using the unicode rules for everything helps add peace of mind that the very smart unicode people have worked very hard to make sorting work

are currently using watin to do ui testing on our web in effect we are doing integration testing from top to bottom since we are using a test database and not order to make sure the test database is in an expected state we have previously been using sql snapshot feature to rollback the database at the beginning of each this is fairly slow and also causes an error immediately after the snapshot is each the tests are invoking the ui and potentially using multiple db we have no way of start a transaction on each was wondering if it is possible to somehow attach all database connections to a single transaction and roll them back at a later this would probably have to happen at the db level anyone has any other suggestions on how to reset our test data for each ui test love to hear your test can you enlist all db connections into a single

are designing a web site and have run into some ui challenges that would be neatly solved with a tabbed users will interact with different elements of the site are some basic functions and having only one object in one tab visible at a time simplifies things quite a of completely comfortable with tabbed interfaces but what about novice searched the web for guidance and i found anything do you have experience presenting a tabbed interface to novice users and did they have trouble with have we reached the point where everyone is comfortable with tabs and we can use them without is more so for this project than if naive users are confused by a tabbed interface it just work and have to find another tabbed interfaces	
are experiencing an oracle deadlock deadlock detected while waiting for it has been suggested that the issue is with a process that is performing readonly operations using hibernate while another process is performing an update on the same readonly process in question is configured using hibernate and we have not explicitly defined a transaction for the while that may not be ideal i fail to see why hibernate would try to get an exclusive lock on a row when no operations were performed only a my question does when no explicit transaction management is try to get a lock on a row even if only a of an object is no is it possible that defining a transaction around the service that is loading and then specifically saying readonly on the transactionattributes would cause hibernate to ignore an already existing row lock and just load the data for readonly are some code loading the record we are using a class hibernatepurchaseorderdataservice extends hibernatedaosupport implements purchaseorderdataservice public purchaseorderdata return spring configuration for the service calling this method actual deadlock is occurring on one of the purchaseorderitem records being loaded by the call to the load the this cause a deadlock if the record being loaded was locked by another and if so would adding a transaction wrapper such as the one below solve the all methods require a transaction the database team has seen trace messages on the server that seem to indicate that our process is actually writing to the database there are logged commands that are performed on the exact columns we are reading from the it seems that hibernate is automatically writing these records back out to the database though we asking it that would probably explain why there is a this be because of a session flush or something looking more like the solution might be to use a transaction wrapper with readonly on deadlock when hibernate application loading data for readonly

argue that this problem is simple to when viewed in the proper you care about order of the only whether they appear in a subset of the number of times each element appears in the for the one element set how many subsets are clearly there are only two now suppose we added another that is distinct from to form the set we can form the list of all sets very take all the sets that we formed using only and add in zero or one copy of in we double the number of clearly we can use induction to show that for n distinct the total number of sets is just that some elements appear multiple consider the set with three copies of thus how many subsets can you this is we can have or 3 copies of so the total number of subsets is 4 since order does not for n copies of the element we will end up with possible expand this by adding in some of copies of so we have n copies of a and m copies of how many total subsets are this seems clear to every possible subset with only a in it were of we can add between 0 and m copies of the total number of subsets when we have n copies of a and m copies of b is it must be we can use an inductive argument to show that the total number of subsets is the product of such merely count up the total number of replicates for each distinct add and take the what happens with the set we get the set we get

asking for communications what really talking about is a hidden agenda in your specific bosses with hidden agendas are a tricky and sometimes dangerous sometimes that agenda can be sometimes it can be something your task is to get them to admit what the agenda while keeping their feathers need to both physically supporting paperwork and god forbid visual and if just getting some mental preparation will if you may be faced with generating performance failing to prepare is preparing to your target specific and keep the list small and if you have more than 5 asking for the average person handles only simultaneous at a and you want to vex them with need to set aside at least 15 if you get done it will be seen as a positive thing completed the meeting early and went on to other good warning you get more than 5 or they think that the 5 minute manager means everything is answered in 5 minutes or this is a bad really and you will not be able to break through your work issues because your boss has more or less erected a permanent i know this but if you get a time slot with them take your lunch with need to get your boss to agree to stop moving around at this i get to sit still and and not be distracted by other close the office door and keep it distractions are the unintended adhd syndrome of bosses and even a missed cell phone call can break a train of leading to heck i just get back to as an excuse to get out of the the whole point of getting time with them is to get their their on what you are trying to you are ready to communicate keep one rule in only speak when absolutely unless absolutely needed to confer the information your boss or if needed to keep the communication even bother openning your was remarkably in this is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all this you need to approach and breach the you will want to do so in a you want to do so without generating the feeling that anyone you or your boss is at fault for the be presenting the issue in a manner that encourages you want this to be a positive impression and you will want to keep this the slightest hint of negative can often turn against i cannot give this enough negative and even negative are weapons in the hands of a bad boss with a bad agenda that targets do give them it will devolve into an opportunity to use any of this against wanna puke with the constant and but trust me on to put the thumbscrews to you if everything they try to use against you is a hopefully that the case and just a situation where a and this meeting will set you both on the right technical unless something going to hear over the long think of remember when was trendy how would you like it if your boss latched on to this term and used it for the next you cringe less and feel better when they if they used the correct this is the corollary to the when maxim above everything you say will be under a brilliant spotlight for a few and verbal gaffs will stick around long that they know what it is you assume that they also may harbor or any one of thousands of other personal or political also consider that they may be filtering what you say through those and get them to clearly define what they consider to be it might be something entirely different from what is called for in and that will touch back on the agenda just if their definition sounds even slightly do not let it ask them to clarify or provide additional what you want to accomplish is to get them to admit what their hidden agenda is in a polite manner that threaten it is sparkling what their agenda be sure to repeat it back to just to make sure i have it down you said you want accomplished by means of xyz within a given timeframe that you repetition back to them will give them a sense that their communcation was effective and provide a positive bosses like this because they feel their intentions are conveyed so this is a good should give you the critical insight have a better understanding of their expectations and like it or part of your job is to set if their expectations are or completely disconnected from the reality of the it falls to you to provide informative feedback that focuses on what they need to accomplish not if that feedback shows that their expectation is quickly it on their all needed is exactly that a on their part of what is really needed and really going the goal here is to start and establish an unbroken chain of communication between you and and that communication will only help everyone out over the long by this point you get a sense of what it is that they are then the situation is truly dire and not in a good working situation at either the boss is incompetent by lack of effective communication to their or they are not even close to competent in the field they are working or they have a hidden agenda that is adverse to either way on your way out in the long thank them for their assure them that the meeting was and and drop the whole in the stick it out and do the best you but start looking on your personal for work i truly hope this the but i have been in this situation at least and while pretty clear better off just getting out while you this on your good	
asking for possible changes to the so i presume a significant engineering team behind this are also a few pieces of clarififying info that would help define the problem much ipc process do you they really have to be or can they be is it okay if the have to talk to each other through and not by using shared is the memory are you straight smp with 1024 or is there some other numa memory or mmp going on what are your page tables only the very smallest of info about azul i would guess that you have very little and that a simple one kernel per model might actually work out just if processes need to talk to each then they can create sockets and transfer data that does your hardware support this would likely end up needing one ip address per core as and at 1024 ip this might be although they could all be and maybe not such a big if this model would lead to some like extra page and a fair bit of ram and may even not be supported by your hardware if kernel per you could likely run and be just letting each kernel control 8 physical if you wanted to run 1 thread per core in a traditional smp machine with 1024 cores only a few physical then i would expect that the old fashioned scheduler is what likely that your will end up nearly in kernel and doing interrupt but just fine for this use unless you need more than 1 core to handle your	
assemblies on which your project depends should definitely be in source your build process should be able to get everything it requires operating system and core framework from source you should not require specific software to be installed on your build how i tend to organise this stuff in a separate team project called something like or to hold these the binaries as required over to a folder in each project that requires a reference to these for you might end up with something like this the copy of the ms dll in yourteamproject is a branched copy of the assembly in referencing the binaries from your be sure to use relative file references to the copies of the dll in your in this way everyone on the team knows where to find the binaries that are referenced by the various projects in your and the relative paths should be the same for each member of your this you only have a single copy of each version of the assembly in your source should the release a bugfix version of the you can update your copy in and merge the changes across to all your projects which make use of

background i have a concurrent map i used to cache some values that change quite often worth caching them from i want to evict items from my cache at regular intervals by examining an expire time in the i am using the method to get a reference to all my keys and then check the values and if expired i remove in other threads the cache is being queried and the javadocs for it mentioned if the map changes while i am iterating over the keyset set the results are obviously i would like a defined way of dealing with this so the results are would it be enough to pass the set to a hashset and then iterate over this set as it is my understanding this set will not be backed by the is this a wasteful of memory way of doing any ideas my evictor is not the only way for items to be removed from the concurrent map so am i correct in saying that i need to copy the keyset to another set before iterating through in it turns out i was reading the javadocs for the map method instead of the concurrentmap thanks my bad a set view of the contained in this the set backed by the so changes to map are reflected in the if the map is while an iteration over the set is progress through own remove results of the iteration the set supports which removes corresponding mapping from the via the removeall and it does not support add or addall concurentmap question when map is modified and iterating over

been a little way down the same path as yourself on previous projects and yet to see a clean approach to solve the i think the real answer is that soa causes as many problems as it the logic goes that by decoupling everything you can switch services and their implementations if the price that we pay for such a feature is code that turns into a spaghetti mess of and injected dependencies then is the benefit worth the hassle i say current approach to soa is to approach with we harvest services from conventionally written code once the the intent and implementation have settled

been a web developer for really quite some time but this is something never really and my progress so far has used some very complex the following is the layout i there are to this layout as i will explain in a header sidebar and the header are and so is the however you can scroll the using the css property on a container for the body section is not an the reason being is that an application which utilises the meaning that the scrollbar not a contain scrollbar is what is used to record the x and y i have achieved this but using some complex layout techniques which just my html looks like the sidebar code using and i use all of these divs for a specific so i can absolutely position borders on the content the rest of the divs actually block off content by changing the background colour of them so you see the content when you css file is far too large to be posting on but the general ul solid 0 0 as you can see from the i set a fixed make it and then set a the containing has a fixed width thus causing a when you horizontally scroll the the content will be hidden when it hits the this creates an effect much like any 10px 20px you can see that the has absolute positioning keeping it in that content anything outside of the content box is displayed even if you scroll horizontally or there better ways of doing it seems a of to be doing something really quite this layout a problem that part even difficult is maintaining simple with a complex and by i mean something unable to i have achieved the desired effect just looking for a better way of doing this is based on business i have a choice

believe missed on some basic idea behind starts with reusable units of with an emphasis on creating the case of the rtf memo it meets the above criteria by handling a given set of data in such a way that your program and other objects within your program care how it does purpose is to show an accept manipulate that specific and pass that data on to another part of your idea behind being is simply that you can replace that memo control with another control which meets the same interface that you can instantiate let the user interact with and pull the data out when loosely coupled goes hand in hand with the idea of of which is the process of breaking a program into distinct features in order to reduce overlapping functionality and make easier to but they are not the same this was also one of the main drivers behind moving away from the procedural style of programming into as oop forces the programming to think in terms of related and discrete sounds like you are really asking about are many ways to achieve sometimes it involves keeping the processing and persistance layers separated the mvc design pattern for sometimes it is simply keeping related functions together in order to reduce which the rtf control already does by containing all of the functions necessary to manipulate the data so that you have further hope that

benchmarks so far show java and c are about on par with each your benchmarks are severely will always be orders of magnitudes faster then both and java unless you do something seriously that this is not an attempt to try to bully neither nor i like both java and and there are other reasons why you would for many problems choose either java or instead of but neither java nor would in a correct written tests never be able to perform with the same speed as because of the sheer number of comments arguing against my these two class public int public static void y new int idx new this one int myclass int idx idx version first of all needs to store its array on the the c version stores the array on the to store stuff on the stack is merely changing the value of an integer value while to store stuff on the heap means finding a big enough chunk of memory and potentially means traversing the memory for a pretty long mostly and java allocates huge chunks of memory which they keep on spending till out which makes this logic execute but even then to compare this against changing the value of an integer is like an f16 against an oil tanker of all in the c version since all those objects are already on the stack we need to explicitly create new objects within the yet again for this is a for available memory while the c version is a zip nothing of all is the fact that the c version will automatically delete all these objects when they run out of yet again this is an operation which changes the value of an integer which would on most cpu architectures take between 1 and 3 cpu the version do but when the garbage collector kicks in and needs to collect those items my guess is that talking about of cpu the c version will instantly become x86 code an x86 while the version would first become il then later when executed it would have to be jit which probably alone takes orders of magnitudes longer time then only executing the c some wise guy could probably execute the above code and measure cpu however basically no point at all in doing because mathematically proven that the managed version would probably take several million times the number of cpu cycles as the c so my guess is that now talking about orders of magnitudes slower in this and this is a in that i for something to prove my however i challenge those that commented badly against me on this post to create a sample which does not execute faster in c and which also use constructs which you normally never would use in c due to that and java are great i prefer them over c time of the but not because because they are they are slower then c and unless coded blindfolded in c or of course have the which would seriously change the speed for the above if we changed the class to a value type by using the keyword instead of the struct keyword means that would store new objects of the given type on the stack which for the above sample would increase the speed still the above sample happens to also feature an array of these though if we went through and optimized the version like we would still end up with something several orders of magnitudes slower then the c written piece of c code will be faster then python and i i love and most of the work i do today is and not however i use because faster then i use because i need the speed gain c gives me for most of my and java is though slower then and for that

best guess is that the 2nd time you call openconnection you closed it and so you try to set the connectionstring property of an already open this in you want your methods to actually create a new connection every time along the lines of the factory so that the connection can be properly something more like sqlconnection better if the connection string is pulled from a config var result new connection string return will be no corresponding rely on the idisposable pattern to make sure the connection is always closed then you will use that function and connection in a method like datatable var result new string sql from where using cn using cmd new using rdr return statements work with any object that implements the idisposable and they guarantee your connection is closed even if an exception is notice that i made the method this is because this class will become your data access by making the connection you will enforce a good db layer where the only way to talk to the db is to come through this code that needs to talk to the db should go in if this class starts to get too big you can mark this method as rather than private and move your data access layer into own assembly project in visual the key is now to limit your methods to accepting input for try to build an generic method that lets you pass in the sql that way lies never connect to a database from your application via the sa and posting your sa account details to a public web site just that

best not to use identity columns with nhibernate if they cause nhibernate to make more trips to the make batching and essentially break the unit of work this is discussed on and in a few like this or is usually a better you really want to continue using and have it seed from then some possibilities a but probably need to first set your like allows nhibernate to know that an identity of means the object is not saved would also need to ensure that all entities have a default value of also obviously default to class order public virtual long private public id pretty then a matter of figuring out how to get schemaexport to seed from it may do this already using as the check to see if it if then you might need to look at patching it or overriding the one way would be to use xslt to transform the generated hbm pretty

best you would have to use rather than an explicit unless you want to restrict all multiple return values to be of the same type likely you would also be limiting the scope of the currently you can declare a variable at a higher scope and initialize it in an out with this the variable would go out of scope in the same block as its obviously this is usable in some but i want to enforce this as the general obviously you could leave the option in but chances are people are going to code for one approach or the	
bet that what is killing performance is allocating and releasing in each object allocates native which is why you have to this means each time you allocate and dispose a you have to transition from the jvm to native code and you cache your instances while in the 300x300 pixel loop and then dispose of the objects after your need a somewhat intelligent cache that only holds a maximum of so many and after that will dispose of some of its but this should speed things up

better question there a reason to have an core data is really an object graph management not a persistence in other its job is to manage the relationships between objects in the object inverse relationships make this for that core data expects inverse relationships and is written for that use without you will have to manage the object graph consistency in relationships without an inverse relationship are very likely to be corrupted by core data unless you work hard to keep things the cost in terms of disk size for the inverse relationships really is insignificant in comparison to the benefit it gains

between events and delegates and its respective are the advantages of do i use wonder what the purpose of delegates i used them that much and really think of my written that a delegate is a for all methods that comply with its you can add multiple methods to one and then be executed after eachother in the order they were which is probably only usefull for methods that affect local variables or methodes that return any read that implements events as which is documented as represents the method handle an event that has no the source of the an that contains no event delegate void eventargs kinda can someone give a usefull example of this purpose of

blank line is somewhat easier for repeated entry of multiple after the user finishes one record the user just tabs again to a newly created blank line and keeps no need to reach for the the use of a blank line also results in the records being in the order the user making it easy to check work as one if you know the task is to enter records the table is you can the cursor in the blank row to save the user the trouble of finding and clicking the insert insert button is somewhat easier for adding records intermixed among other the user have to scroll to the end of the table before which generally takes longer than hitting a button and makes a user lose place in the for tables already filled with an insert button may be more discoverable than the blank line assuming the button is always in view blank at the bottom is scrolled out of and user may not think to scroll down and find of have both an insert button and a blank or otherwise try to have the best of both for you can have the insert button but if a table is you can open it with a blank line for the tabbing from the last field in the last line could be an means of inserting a line for data entry or the insert button can have an accelerator key maybe so the data entry users can use it to insert multiple records without their fingers leaving their the insert button maybe should also insert a new record below the current one so that new records are in the order they are

book covers use of ada the java system and realtime posix extensions in none of these is directly a domain specific 95 is a programming language commonly used in the late 90s and still widely used for realtime programming in defence and aerospace there is at least one dsl built on top of ada which is a system of annotations which describe system characteristics to a program verification of april 2006 indicates some of the classes and virtual machine changes which make up the java it mention any domain specific language i come across use of java in but i been looking at the sorts of systems where expect to find it work in aerospace where fortran and occasionally ada for is a set of extensions to the posix operating system as os they require anything specific in the that i can thing of one c based dsl for describing embedded systems but no idea if also used to generate the embedded mentioned in the book is which in the last few years has gone from a simulation tool to a model driven development system for realtime in a dsl for linear state machines and matlab can generate or for realtime and embedded very rare to see an ew or other defence industry job advertised which require some matlab work for matlab but hard to over emphasis how ubiquitous it really is in the

both like and dislike are great for organising code into general areas such as etc and then hiding them away great for stuff like control development were there are usually a lot of properties with and be used if following a notify property change they are great when you are implementing several interfaces and you want to group the interface implementations separately from the main they do get in the way when you want to see the entirety of the code or you are browsing through it looking for and even worse when someone code and they agree with your conventions for naming and grouping i would like to see is an easily accessible feature in visual studio that allowed a and toggling option so i could have the best of both worlds when it suited perhaps such things will be easy to implement as extensions to the ide in

building a heavily crud based website and got to the phase of the project where trying to build a search webpage that shows the user different subsets of a certain important table based on parameters they enter such as dates and different text use a fixed sql because depending on whether they search by date or by something the sql would be so instead i have been generating a results list using a table web control that starts out invisible and then is filled and set to visible once the user identifies a search they want to i used a table control because its easy to create and modify in the code and i was able to make the needed calls to the database and populate that table as the second thing i need with this search is the ability to allow the user to select a record from the results and then go edit it using the rest of the crud based pages on the to do i created in the table and gave them all different ids and the same event but since i created the buttons it seems the event disappears on callback and my scheme so taking a second look at how to do current code for the events looks tempcell new button tempbutton new new results table is declared like like to be able to identify which record the user so i can send that info on to another and of i still need to be able to generate results for several different search currently i have template and code based searches that lead to different stored procedures and different parameters based on what the user has suggestions on it seems like the data grids and repeaters require sql statements in advance to work so not sure how to use but if i could then the item command approach would work with the is the best approach for this crud search page in

business model was actually rampant during the dot com company a thought it would provide an email service for free and once it has a million users it could other services or add on some premium if even users sign on that would still generate a good residual monthly income from a 100k but as soon as company a goes premium another company would come out with the same model offering the same services for free and company model company a then might resort to increasing switching costs and locking people in though email has a high switching cost this work but another reason i bring this up is that this is exactly what you could be facing down the you could make a strong case for sustaining for 5 years but if a company comes out 4 years from now and does a really good job of the same just lost a lot of time and money but they got in even if your switching costs are high and your users are locked entirely possible that the new company might offer a migration path to circumvent just this and you could then take measures to really hijack the data but not that easy and it would lead to negative publicity from frustrated users feel their data is theirs to your question is quite i provide much feedback but unless the scenario is really compelling a hard road to tread even if larry page approached me with a search engine want to know the monetization strategy patents provide a safety is also the question of employee employees get nice perks and bonuses because always strapped for cash and they always feel that the reward is too far you will end up giving out a lot of stock options and raising multiple rounds of investments which be gives you a safety net in that when five years from now it becomes you can execute on your idea and still have and even if you fail to execute execute you may take comfort in the fact that someone else might be able to execute while you can get if you really want to get this thing out you might be able to throttle your costs by making it an beta so you end up mushrooming your it will also provide you with a platform that you can mature over the years and as hardware becomes more affordable you can continue to issue more

by point you mean the folder per i can see your i would simply add the reference to each test on the other you really mean put your tests in the same assembly as your i heartily agree with him and disagree with your tests should be distinct from your production code in order to enhance code clarity and keeping your test classes separate helps the next programmer understand it more if you need access to internals in your tests and you might since internal methods are to the you can use the internalsvisibleto construct in the would recommend in it is sufficient to unit test only the public interface of the done properly the private methods of your code will simply be refactorings of previous public code and will have sufficient test coverage through the public of this is a guideline not a law so there will be times that you might want to test a private in those you can create an accessor and use reflection to invoke the private recommendation that i would make is to use unit testing and code coverage in code coverage can be a useful heuristic to identify when you need more lack of coverage should be used as a guide to indicate where more testing may be this to say that you need coverage some code may be simple enough not to warrant a unit test for and they may not be touched by your existing were a couple of issues that i had with the probably the biggest is the lack of abstraction away from the database for unit there probably are some integration tests that need to go against the db perhaps when testing trigger or constraint functionality if you convince yourself of their correctness in of the opinion that you should implement your data access as then mock out the actual implementations in your unit tests so that there is no need to actually connect to the i find that my tests run and thus i run them more often when i do building up a database interface might take a little while but can be reused as long as you stick with the same design pattern for your data i would recommend using nunit with a very useful plugin whether doing nunit or makes it very handy to run or debug tests with a context

bytecode the method is referred to by its parameter types and return so the two methods are quite the bytecode your method would be the new method can see the signatures using return types are actually implemented at compile time by javac using synthetic bridge they do not have runtime so if you override with javac will create both methods in the derived class with calling

cannot define constructor signatures in that make sense anyway since the interface enforce how the implementations are classes though can indeed have they must be protected since public constructors does not make sense they should only be called by concrete ioc principle dictates that instead of having class a know about and instantiate class you should instead pass in a reference to ib to the constructor of then a will not need to know about class b and thus you can easily substitute class b with some other implementation of passing in an already instantiated object of class the ib interface need to have a constructor

code because using locking without making the field unfortunately have a volatile so you apply the normal just acquire the lock every time or use static initialization to initialize when the type is singleton for a general discussion of this with regards to singletons i know this a but the page gives but it should be fairly easy to i generally recommend making lock variables you really want to be changing the value general static properties okay to lock on a static variable initialize it like you are try to write or code unless you know what i regard myself as reasonably knowledgeable about and i still try using locking initialization is a few caveats if you have complex initializers which end up referencing each so a good time to do initialization like this then you really need a you need to make the type a just write function to initialize the list and return then use that function in the initializer for the this has to be declared as the initializer will execute in textual order just create the array inside buildregexes and have it as a field at unless you need the array that would be a better shared readonly as string shared readonly as shared readonly property as return end shared function as dim list new for each exp as string in or or return

compiler for this type of checks i always fallback to compiler before going back to the standard and 6 for copyright comeau all rights errors line is not allowed in a template virtual void line is not allowed in a template virtual void as it has been posted by other the fact is that the standard does not allow you to define virtual templated the rationale is that for all virtual an entry must be reserved in the the problem is that template methods will only be defined when they have been instantiated this means that the vtable would end up having a different number of elements in each compilation depending on how many different calls to with different types then hell would be what you want is a templated function on one of its arguments and one specific version being virtual the part of the you can do template void t a virtual void int a derived public virtual void int a derived b 5 compiler will prefer the method and print you want this generalized for any then you are out of consider other type of delegation instead of polymorphism delegation could be a more info on the problem at hand would help in determining a

complain if you do it but javascript sure will if you want to grab one element by its real answer is that there is a semantic difference between an identifier for one and only one object and an identifier that can apply to multiple while you can break the rules it is best not is also one other distinction between the an element allows more than one class to be applied like do that with	
completely agree with with the addendum that dogfood testing is important even for and often more than once started using a product that other parts of qa even have supposedly finished and found unconscionable bugs in normal sometimes this as the joel on software article just poor it is surprisingly common for the first example in a tutorial to fail deja but more often because dogfooding is a very different process from systematic not doing what told to doing what you actually do when trying to find very good test plan might cover some of those but in the most embarrassing example in my own the test plan was part of the a conspicuous which most developers would be certain to was officially and hence but necessary i suppose a more reasonable functional requirements definition have made that if you know of any company whose are always entirely reasonable and which is do let me know

compute a you have to traverse both trees you have to examine the properties of each node and perform the hash for if a is in the you have to iterate over its characters and do some then you have to combine the hash of the node with the hash of the computing a hash value for two structures is of the same order a little more as comparing them for equality one in because when performing an equality you can stop as soon as you detect any a single equality test is going to be much on is likely to be beneficial only if you cache the hash value and reuse it many and because hash values for different trees can you still need to have equality comparison

concerns are been taking the approach of it fix and leaving existing web services alone until they need for new development we have been adopting wcf the solution to communication problems big and the most tangible benefit is the ease of integration if you have a nice clean object the most tangible negative is that there are much more configuration especially when you start trying to secure find it interesting you mentioned the spec as that is where we had the most problems integrating wcf with a java the security features are just plain missing right and we ended up using for that one piece of the side of would highly recommend through these even if you do security with wcf right you probably will have to at some

could make a object that uses the table and go from there or you a friend as a partial entity name and and pull the user object into the friend like this last model better because it allows you to represent friends more you would still have a copy of the friend name if it is a duplicate of the user and the id to identify if the user is gone or keeps the concept a little further away from the concept and any security i will argue appropriate to duplicate the field as it adds flexibility and information about a user that used to take on you would still have to eventually back to the user but perhaps not as if you really hate to anything you can have a person object that friend and user both refer to for i think that is a nice theoretical but not worth the complexity it would introduce into the bulk of your code of it being talking about the user and talking about the i would make the user easy to talk about and the friend a little not this i enjoyed mentally toying with this

database design for this is simple as you as far as it taking longer once the user has more what you can do is just paginate the show the first or whatever makes sense and only pull those generally your times increase very much unless the volume of messages increases by an order of magnatude or you should be able to pull back 1000 short messages in way less than a now it may take more time for the page to display at that but thats where the pagination should would suggest though going through and thinking of future features and building your database out a little more based on adding more features to the software is changing the database is comparatively

dealing with data from a it starts to get fuzzy whether you should rely on or doing queries in the i think in if you have a always best to do as much filtering and sorting in the db as and use linq to objects especially on large collections of since dal code can get kind of i find that sometimes just easier to run a findall query in the and then just use linq to objects to sort and only if your collection is is useful for doing sorting and filtering on this might be a collection that you pulled from the database that you need to filter down a little but it could also be just any collection in

default character set of urls when used in html pages and in http headers is called or iso not the same as and not the same as but it does fit into the range 0 to 127 is a lot like and the whole range 0 to 255 is the same as the range of you can generate it from a string by casting each character to a or you can use to get an object to do the conversion for this character the uk pound symbol is rfc that unencoded text must be limited to the traditional us ascii and anything else the special url delimiter must be but it leaves open the question of what character set to use for the upper half of the making it dependent on the context in which the url that context is defined by two other http and which do specify the default character and which together create a practically irresistable force on implementers to assume that the address bar contains that refer to the character set of content sent via except where otherwise so by the time a url string appears in the http get it ought to be in other factor is that html also uses as its and urls typically originate as links in html so when you craft a simple minimal html page in the urls you type into that file are in sometimes described as in the but not just that fill in the blank left by the rfc for for the advice on encoding of a character of a followed by hexadecimal of the code point for the is another name for much for the paste this into save it as an and open it in a few click the link and google should search for uk works in apple google chrome i have any others available right

definitely a good idea to keep fairly close to the current by not upgrading you save on any immediate but you save an enormous amount of work for later on in the life typically those who make the conservative decision will be long gone by the time the absolute critical need to upgrade occurs so they away there it is up to us as technical resouce to point out that short term pain is better than a complete project meltdown shining example of this is a massive system written on oracle which is still on oracle today it fails next to impossible to patch as that version is too and will be thrown away as soon as anyone has the political cajones to make it the cost of not upgrading would currently be running at in specialist and lack of compatibilty with other line is not upgrading means big dollars being spent

depends on your skill level with the specific database product that going to think of it as the difference between a and transmission orms provide you with that just start designing your and let the orm worry about getting it stored into the database the problem with most orms is that in their quest to be pi they often take advantage of specific database features that can provide elegant solutions for a given i say all just take is to design the conceptual data model first then you can go in either up towards the application or down towards the physical but only you know if more advantageous to use a view instead of a should you normalize or a what make sense with this is a natural or surrogate key more appropriate for this of if you feel that these questions are beyond your then let the orm help you more you really need to seperate the application design from the database they are almost never the how important is that could another application be designed to use that a lot easier to refactor an application than it is to refactor a database with a billion rows of data spread across thousands of

difference between the golomb coding and binary code is that binary code is not a prefix which is a for coding strings of arbitrarily large numbers cannot decide if 1010101010101010 is a concatenation of 10101010 and 10101010 or something they are not that easily the golomb code is optimal for geometric in this case with parameter the probability of 42 is some so you get the idea about how important is this for the length of the output

do i handle page load postback uses a brand new instance of your page and completely rebuilds the the only thing different is that some controls might be via you need to repeat the load work for any of those i need to know what caused the will handle that for you and fire the you only need know whether it is a and maybe not even that the next i need to reload the grid on as sort you need to the html for the grid to the the good news is odds are your grid data is already in viewstate and it will happen you need to worry about it in many cases you may find that better to turn off viewstate for grids and reload them on each postback this is because viewstate is just a hidden input on your page that must be posted to the server with each most internet users have very limited upload and so a large viewstate can make your site seem even if your server is hardly breaking a on your you might do better by trading some server performance for site responsiveness by disabling viewstate on select in this you will always load the grid and no longer need care whether or not a request is a if this is an application where users typically have local ethernet connections to your web server hard to beat viewstate for balancing responsiveness and server

domain model is indispensable in most it gives the technical staff a clear and unambiguous understanding of the domain a uml class diagram is the best notation for this even better than an english language use case model not is much easier to manipulate than a dozen word documents on your choice of uml of and so recommend you follow the uml route in documenting your use your uml tool will almost certainly allow you to assign additional information to your use such as test metrics having this in a model will allow you to create custom reports on this extra say that if you need a state use a uml state if you need a flow use a uml activity if you need a call use a uml sequence in each the uml notation is going to be more widely understood than whatever ad hoc notation you invent on your the general message to use whatever tools you have at hand to make your job

done since there is no continuity in your problem value of a position is not closely related to an other position with only 1 change in the value of one there is very little chance a nn would and it never did in my would rather see a simulated annealing system with an heuristic which there are plenty out to evaluate the value of the if you are set on using a is is relatively easy to a general nn is simply a with each node being a each neuron has a current activation and a transition formula to compute the next activation based on input activation values of all the nodes that have a link to more classical that is with an input an output identical neurons for each and no can thus be represented by an array of input an array of output and a linked graph of nodes connecting each node possesses a current activation and a list of nodes it forwards computing the output value is simply setting the activations of the input neurons to the input and iterating through each subsequent layer in computing the activation values from the previous layer using the transition when you have reached the last you have your

doubt a controversial and definitely a personal i like of the smalltalkers that run into on the net try to say how smalltalk is basically the best thing since sliced and how awful every other language saying that smalltalkers act that way but been a very noticeable trend in the ones very clearly been looking down on anyone who use simply not a good way of persuading people to use a it puts me off because i enjoy learning with a and i really want to be part of a community which looks down on me even if just a vocal minority taking that know enough about smalltalk to comment on it at all and really like to learn it but lower down the list of languages for me to learn than others where had a more positive experience with the nearly had the same problem for due to someone taking that attitude in the but fortunately more engaging personalities have the fact that people like it so much suggests there are good things about it as a technology but a human being rather than a technical merit is only part of the just alone on but in if you want to show someone how awesome your favourite thing and maybe persuade them that should use it starting off by rubbishing their current tool is a bad operating system zealots all should take

doubt you will have any hard data on so i will add some thoughts on you use di other solid because it helps you do its the other way you do tdd because it helps you with the design which usually means you get code that follow those why to use interfaces is a different will assume you agree that having your classes do many different things results in messy i am assuming you are already going for you have different classes that do specific you need a way to relate if you relate them inside the classes the you get plenty of code that uses specific versions of the this means that making changes to the system will be are going to need to change the a fact of software you can call yagni about not adding specific extra but not on that you be needing to change the in my case something really important as i do weekly use a di framework where configuration is done through with a really small code you hook up lots of different when you take away the discussion on interface concrete you are actually saving typing not the other way also for the cases a concrete class is on the it hooks it up automatically have to building the rest of the it also allows me to control some objects life in particular i can configure an object to be a singleton and it hands a single instance all the note that just using these practices more using them for the first is what causes the overhead of the learning process in some cases mind set you gonna need to put all those constructor calls all over the place to go

each element you need to not inherit in your most specific in override height and	
each item so random lookup is extremely fast i can instantly say want the 657415671567th and go straight to because we know its memory address will be exactly 657415671567 bigger than the first this has little or no memory overhead in it has no way of automatically resizing you have to create a new copy across all the and then delete the old plain lists are useful when you need to lookup data from anywhere in the and you know that your list will not be longer than a certain item has a reference to the next this means that there is some overhead store the reference to the next because not stored you immediately go to the 657415671567th element you have to start at the head and then get its reference to go to the and then get its to get to the and then get its reference to get to the and then get its reference to get to the in this it is very inefficient for random it allows you to modify the length of the if your task is to go through each item then about the same value as a plain if you need to change the length of the it could be better than a plain if you know the 566th and looking for the then all you need to do is follow the reference to the next if you know the 567th and looking for the the only way to find it is to start searching from the 1st element this is where double linked lists come in linked linked lists store a reference to the previous this means you can traverse the list as well as this could be very useful in some situations as the example given in the linked list other than they have most of the same advantages and disadvantages as a linked from comments use as a have to take all of those advantages and disadvantages into can you say with confidence that your queue will have a maximum if your queue could be anywhere from 1 to 10000000000 elements then a plain list will just waste memory then may not even be big in that go with a linked rather than storing the of the front and you should actually store the a linked list is made up of and each node stores the item as well as the reference to the next you should store a reference to the first and the last when you you stick a new node onto the rear linking the old rear one to the new rear and remember this new rear when you you remove the front and remember the second one as the new that you have to worry about any of the middle you can thus ignore the length of the queue you can store that too if you really

faced a similar problem on a we solved it by first creating a simple table that only has one a bigint set as we created an sproc that inserts a new row in that using default values and inside a it then stores the in a rolls back the transaction and then returns the stored gives us a unique id inside the database without filling up a you want to know what kind of object the id is referring lose the transaction rollback and also store the type of object along side the that way findout out what kind of object the id is referring to is only one select inner

fact that these are in separate packages has nothing at all to do with the fact that this runs consuming all available calling two methods from within one this circular which is not the same in help you at get exactly the same effect a b best way to avoid this is do more if you have to write recursive functions try not to use multiple functions in the recursion but simply the so you have an easier time mentally keeping track of where your calls should to how to detect whether something like this is you would have to do something simple like increment a variable with your recursion depth and terminate if your depth exceeds a certain but you really have to rely on similar to writing a loop and using an increment there to make sure your function run out of just recurse over a set unless you know how and when it relevant question would be what are you trying to accomplish in the first

fairly new to all so this is probably oop 101 but i get my head around assume the following code lives in an interface void object object class dbstore public public void object public object class public other class public other a second assembly tries to create a gizmomanager and a it because it has no way to get hold of a dbstore it is internal not following work dbstore and idatastore bad because the client assembly can then bypass and access the db however it pass in an idatastore to the gizmomanager and widgetmanager bad because it reduces testability easily pass in a something magic with seem to solve anything because you need to pass the same idatastore to both gizmomanager and widgetmanager and thus the client assembly still needs to assign an idatastore to a variable it because idatastore is is probably stunningly obvious but i just see how would one overcome this objects without breaking

fastest solution to this is to find the and then use that byte in a lookup this gives you a performance of four conditional instructions and a of not only is this the least amount of but the least amount of branches which is on modern table should contain the index of the lsb for each number in the range you check each byte of your value and find the lowest then use this value to lookup the real does require of but if the speed of this function is so important then that is well worth left as an exercise for the reader to note that order to check indices will depend whether you are on a big or little endian this is for bytes if return else if return else if return return

few mixing and some operation like although you can get the file descriptor using that is like taking the longest route to get to the same just using breaks compatibility beyond bsd and so you get nothing by using standard c just use and make sense to use stream formatted on the same file you are when you a you are implicitly telling the system you are going to use it as is for stream you usually use it for sequential in although it is unusual to see and in the same descriptor is not even but due to the previous not considering protection must match the open file since you are passing to and to you are violating this this also highlights why you mix with how do you guarantee that will open the file with the correct this is supposed to be for the c if you want to a file with read and write you should use the to open the use and it is not portable it is a security read about and space

finding all descendents of a row with mptt is finding all children can be however you should be able to fix that by adding a field to your table that records the parent of the then the search contains redundant potentially denormalizing your table but since any already requires global keeping much extra to you could alternatively use a field that records the vertical level of the although that is in fact likely to change under certain types of transformations moving a subtree to a different point in the plain old representation just having and no or is of course faster for but the only queries it can answer efficiently are the parent of and the children of most workloads involve much more reading than so usually mptt is faster overall but perhaps in your case you need to consider moving to

first part of your question has already been answered by no form of inheritance takes the vector behaves as a and nothing are two ways to manipulate the first one is through a for like you i you should use since that is the type returned by cout iterating through the elements contained in the so printing make there is only one cout to access the element contained in the cout is other approach is to use the algorithms defined in the standard as an introduction to going to split it up into a few every container also defines an iterator iterators are conceptually like pointers that point to a location in the so instead of you can call on the element point to by any given an iterator called the syntax would be reason for this is that it allows a common and generic way to traverse because deques and all other container types all provide and these iterators use the same your code can take a pair of denoting the beginning and the end of the range of elements you want to and then the same code will work regardless of the underlying container use a loop to run through the container but this time using current current cout cout is a huge improvement so although it does eliminate the index which often except as a loop the functions return an iterator pointing to the first element in the and another pointing past the of the so as we move the first iterator we know reached the end when it equals the end in this two iterators can represent any range of that we have iterators we can use a lot of other the standard library comes with a number of algorithms for processing sequences of located in the simple one to get us started is which is almost a replacement for a for it is simply a function which takes two denoting the range of elements it should and an action it should perform on so to call we need to define such an cout cout is a function which takes the element type as a and does whatever needs to be now we can call you need to do this it saves a lot of the print function only has to be defined and then every for loop can be replaced with such a nice trick with iterators is that they have to represent the entire we could skip the first five take only the first three any other manipulation you can think are also algorithms such as copy from one iterator range to may be any type of iterator as it have to be a vector iterator just because the source in fact we could even copy directly to if you wanted to print out the contents directly since myclass define the that would result in an work around this little problem with we could use which applies some transformation to each and then places the result into an output since we directly print out a myclass we could just transform it to a which be printed return is fairly simple we simply create a function which takes a myclass and builds a string with the desired so copy this directly to creates a special output stream iterator out of to allow it to function as an and once the actual this on everything in the code became a single the actual action to perform is defined so it have to clutter up the while a for loop is the immediately obvious way to process sequences of elements in a iterators are often a better solution in the long they offer a lot more and even simplifies your code quite a blame you if you prefer to stick with for loops for as a bit easier to i simply wanted to show you that not the answer in	
first question would be what are you keeping in the can you move it to a we keep every config setting in a table in our database and use the to store the db connection sure how much of a rewrite that would be for but it would avoid your option would be to house your configuration items in an external file and reference it from the changes to that file would not be until the aspnet wp was recycled but would allow you to change setting and then cycle each server via an

first thing to note is that user agent sniffing does not just mean looking at it is a general term to describe the large array of methods that people use to change behaviour based on what they believe the browser the problem is looking at the user agent the problem is deciding what your site should do based on what you think the browser this means you may unavoidably limit or break your site in the for instance i have seen multiple canvas demos which block they checking to see whether canvas is they are explicitly looking for and if they see it they say ie is this means that even if ie did eventually support canvas these sites still than browser sniffing you should always attempt to detect the feature or bug you are interested the most common example of these tests is is how the existence of canvas should be and will correctly pick up canvas in any even if current versions support

for why and are over my feeling is that most people think of the latter as a way to iterate over a using the condition to define the rather than continuing to iterate over a block while some condition still the keyword semantics lend themselves to this interpretation and i suspect partly because of people find that the expressions are most readable in that for i would never use or to iterate over a though i and i used to use most often due to the but now i generally write i suppose that come to value readability over compactness and seems easier to parse quickly and thus more readable to my mind even though i do end up repeating a small amount of i rarely write while statements typically using foreach or linq in the cases where while statements would previously been come to think of not sure i use many for except in unit tests where generating some fixed number of a test

from a perspective you should be asking the difference between web applications and client within each you can ask about the difference between standard web applications and mobile web apps and standard client apps and mobile client difference between web and client applications is that web applications lack every page request is completely from every other page it is only through various technical that web applications manage to maintain the illusion that a web app user is running a coherent application as they navigate from page to in for the isapi dll manages a object that pulls a session cookie from the page request and then provides uses it to identify the session data appropriate for the handling of the a client by every aspect of the application is targeted at a single user and the of the application is a given as you navigate from dialog to in the tight integration of the application with the computer permits the use of resources in a web by there is little or no access to these resources except as mediated by the browser a client not a web web applications just web applications with two the screen size is considerably smaller and the browser capabilities are generally less write a mobile web app in pretty much the same way as a standard web app but you can not count on some of the capabilities that you usually have with a this last by the is rapidly going away as mobile devices become more applications require a development deployment that is specific to the mobile the tools and techniques used in standard client application development map particularly well to the mobile need to learn new controls and the only real exception to this rule are the tools available through microsoft has attempted to provide as much commonality as possible even find that you have a different mind set and different constraints than when developing a winforms this

good situation that sparse branching is suitable for is when you have a complicated product potentially made up of lots of say the build takes a long time for the whole and perhaps the sync takes a while too lots of data but your development only needs to modify a small subset of the whole source base maybe a module or with possibly some linkage code this doing a sparse branch can make a lot of it means you have already synced to the bulk of the and probably already built but you do have to be careful that any files you modify are branched first otherwise you risk breaking the certainly it requires more care by the case where sparse branching may be the only practical way of doing branched development is if it is hard to have more than one version of your app on a development in this case it would be tricky to have both a mainline build and a development build building and running side by obviously not but some products are like that either by necessity or

good way to identify this issue if it comes up again is to click on the root add folder path to the shown then click the all descendants sort the files by and look for the unknown files and see if multiple files of the same name are checking out to the same usually this is the result of a mistaken or a change in folder it is undetermined what order starteam will check files having two different files with the same name pointing to the same local location is a the 2005r2 native windows client and cross platform client would pull files in a slightly different causing views with this issue to produce checkouts with different are a few ways to legitimately end up with this situation keeping multiple branches of a single file on the tip and designating which to use by view label is a common starteam is one of the few vcs that can handle multiple references like if you can help never delete and a of the it what you want to a file to the server gives it a whole new archive in the database and it will not be tied in any way to existing shares of that you will also lose all of your revision look for ways to move and if you have multiple files with the same name and content on your it is usually a good idea to make an effort to share the file to the various places it should exist rather than this will make sure your changes propagate so you need to fixes multiple

got a little lost with your but if you are looking for a way to do database you can do it couple of your mvc can use zend framework that comes with database access you can use keep in mind that you should design your system well to ensure there is no contention in the database as your queries are all scattered across the php pages and may lock tables resulting in the overall web application deteriorating in performance and becoming slower over is why sometimes it is prefereable to use stored procedures as it is in one place and can be tuned when we need though other may argue that it is easier to debug if query statements are on the

got an answer via sql server portion here from aaron key here is that all report model queries are centered around a and each row at the detail level in your report represents a row in this base you may note that in your there is no entity which corresponds to charge for an order or just the order if it has no you need to explicitly create this entity in the based on a named query in the this named query can just select the keys from the ord table and the charge table with a left outer join between the you then create relationships from these keys to the ord and charge and update the model on model root node and you start with details from ord and navigate through the new role to charge and select additional report builder will choose the entity as the entity of the are considering functionality for a future release to allow creating these types of queries directly in report builder without requiring the model designer to explicitly create the left outer join

guess what the original author had in mind was something in the lines of hierarchical mysql does not have native support for hierarchical queries for example where you could use to achieve what you the easiest way to remove all orphans would be to execute a query select from table left join table t2 on where is would yield you all rows from where their parent this with a php script that keeps executing the query and deleting any and after a couple of iterations your table should be free of orphans whole thing can probably be merged into one delete statement you could just execute in a while need to execute the multiple times because of transitivity consider a situation where an orphan is parent to another with the first iteration remove the first making the next record in chain an make sure you explicitly skip the head of your otherwise end up with an empty table the head by an

had good luck hiring open source maintainers to enhance libraries that we are some projects done in the needed to integrate quake 2 with we hired vadim a major contributor to in less than 4 he built a wxquake2 widget by adapting the windows version of quake we needed to portable access to raw so we hired vadim and worked with him to produce a new raw bitmap this involved a substantial bit of design but we really liked the resulting and we use it to this a later we hired another one of the core contributors to improve wxwidgets accessibility as it turned we ended up not using this code right for various technical but other people have been enhancing this code since and we hope to use it some other hiring open source maintainers is a lot like hiring any other kind of but some things are a bit some advice based on our have the most luck if you want to enhance an existing project and release the changes as open you want to hire members of the core they have the best track the most and they have the best chance of getting your changes merged want to get your changes merged if you be maintaining a local which is a do some who works on the features you care are they somebody enjoy working read the mailing lists and glance at the version control and pick out a few people to the design there may be a bit of the developers are looking at the larger health of the and looking at the needs of a specific this has occasionally made negotiations a bit more complicated for but the final result has typically been a better design than we would have chosen on our most be in any sufficiently large open source several members of the core team will already run consulting in smaller open source generally find several contributors who to run consulting if still hesitant to approach you can always you know anybody be interested in getting paid to work on if not you put them on the and they may tell you who to the been impressed with the professionalism and productivity of open source and i would recommend this route for

have a core library in the form of a dll that is used by more than one client it has gotten somewhat bloated and some applications need only a tiny fraction of the functionality that this dll so now looking at dividing this behemoth into smaller question is can anyone recommend a path to take to divide this bloated dll into a set of modules that have some interdepencies but do not necessarily require all other are the options as i see them but hoping someone can offer other a dll and several dlls which use the core and possibly other satellite the contents of the bloated dll into static libraries that the main dll uses maintain the same but apps that want to use the bloated version can assemble the static libraries they need into their own dll or into the app was hesitant to mention this but i think it may be important to note that the app uses for your up a utility dll into smaller components in

have a in my application that is used for editing arbitrary i need to be able to run an arbitrary subroutine on another thread that also looks at these objects if the obvious issue is that a user could be editing one of these objects at the same time my search thread is reading which would be preferable to avoid it probably result in anything critical since my search thread is just not is easy enough from my search but after looking through the documentation and a brief skim through the propertydescriptorgridentry code in i cannot seem to find an analogous spot to use a call on the object in question on the i was hoping there would be beginedit and endedit events which would make this simple but i seem to find any such rather not lock the entire object while on display in the propertygrid as that would obviously block my search thread until another object was a bit new to the threading model of windows so hoping some obvious answer just any synchronously cloning my objects before running the search asynchronously will likely be inefficient enough that i might as well run the search itself synchronously the point of running asynchronously is of course to allow my users to continue to work while the search is the search needs to scale as the data set i am going through will eventually end up being arbitrarily which makes synchronous cloning look like it will cause the usability problem i am trying to propertygrid

have a large file server machine which contains several terabytes of image data that i generally access in wondering if there is anything special that i can do to hint to the os that a specific set of documents should be preloaded into memory to improve the access time for that subset of files when they are loaded over a file can supply a parent directory that contains all of the files that comprise a given chunk before i start to access first thing that comes to mind is to simply write a service that will iterate through the files in the specified load them into process memory and then free the memory in hopes that the os filesystem cache holds on to but i was wondering if there is a more explicit way to do would save a lot of work if i could the existing file share access paradigm rather than requiring the access to these files to go through a memory caching files in question will almost always be accessed in a readonly working on windows server filesystem access on a remote

have an application that performs a write to a database each time a page is this db write is not time so for performance i have the page queuing the object using of i have to have something to read the queue and process so i wrote a class that looks similar to class queueprocessor public void create background thread to run public void stop the previously created public void while check queue for process them one at a then wait indefinitely for more since this web site is fairly small in i realy want to have to add a windows service to the deployment so what doing at this time is creating a new queueprocessor in the event and starting it my thought is that the thread will run for the life of the and if the application gets killed by it will merely start up again the next time someone accesses a prevent long periods of idle where queued messages are not processed because the application has been killed by set up a wget request to execute every few minutes on one of the thus keeping the application alive and ensuring the background thread will keep question i see this design very and wondering if there are any potential problems with doing some reading on the i found that the major problem with this approach similar such as the cache removal callback is the type of function they were being asked to perform with regards to for if doing a mass update or you obviously want the task running on all of your web servers have conflicting updates and potential data loss that in my very particular the thread is processing only requests received by that server that are sitting in that message if i were to scale this app to say 5 each thread would process each queued messages without any the order of the records in the database so important that a few similar requests from different servers within a small interval would be a so i still think this solution is reasonable for my threading design

have been working on a small project on and off for a while and i think i am close but it has the idea is to ftp a file up to a 3rd they process it and minutes later they generate a result set which needs to get downloaded and processed on our the code might be a little just something i cobbled if string baselocation string fn baselocation ftp new asynccallback callback new files int chigh string latestfile private static string int nhigh string latestfile while files nhigh latestfile return private void if ftp push the file get a list of the currently processed wait and check every so often and when a new file shows download i added the asynccallback the process worked fine except the user do anything until the page returned and i display any kind of progress after adding in the asynccallback all of a sudden the upload part is spamming the remote end and i managed to crash them at least our particular thoughts on it would be needly to say i sort of need to get the process fixed right because our traders get a little upset when they work and bloomberg gets a little upset when they have to spend hours trying to resolve it in web page run

have been your situation senior year of high school in an internship i c and shell programming mostly via copy and and later on at various times when i may have been in a similar situation with specific a class at your the one you want is the one that is the prerequisite for the advanced programming they probably also offer a never touched a computer level class but this one be the formal prereq for the follow on this will probably be in your way through one of the better programming books that includes kernighan and c programming language is a this would be my recommendation because c is similar enough to php to be but different enough that you will be able to keep them i say this even though you will probably never write a single line of production paul ansi common lisp is also a suitable you are really hard core and have the you can try structure and interpretation of computer by abelson and this is the book used in the first programming course at uc berkeley and at mit this may be too difficult to attempt outside a school designed for bright young students with nothing to do but study and with the regular opportunity to get tutoring from grad i include it only for would avoid any web programming you already know web i get the impression that you are feeling like you are hitting a bit of a and looking at a way around or over that rather than trying to go directly through would advise against looking into any web oriented book because it will not give you the big it will describe technique only as they apply to web the important things to understand are how a computer actually the difference between the stack and the the basics of garbage and probably be helpful to understand at least extension i if you understand shared libraries on or dlls on or classpath and jars on or how to create a library in perl or any one of those will be just the concept of loading outside code

have had recently two telephone interviews where been asked about the differences between an interface and an abstract i have explained every aspect of them i could think but it seems they are waiting for me to mention something and i know what it my experience i think the following is if i am missing a major point please let me single method declared in an interface will have to be implemented in the properties and methods can exist in a a class can implement multiple abstract methods have to be implemented by the an abstract class can have normal methods with abstract class can also have class variables beside properties and a class can only implement one abstract class only due of in all the interviewer came up with the question if you had an abstract class with only abstract how would that be different from an i know the answer but i think the inheritance as mentioned above another interviewer asked me what if you had a public variable inside the how would that be different than in abstract i insisted you have a public variable inside an i know what he wanted to hear but he satisfied to use an interface instead abstract class and vice abstract do you decide between using an abstract class and an vs abstract class

have much experience managing but i work on an application that works like is an interface for the users to select a report they want to view from a list of this list is populated by a reports table in the database which holds info like the report the file and which parameters the report are several common parameters in these reports they are or sorting so the user might pull up a report about all the widgets numbered 200 through grouped by now a person develops a stored and the report file at the same they pass it off to and i have to deploy it by running the sproc script in and moving the file to the right i then have to insert a record into the reports table with the and is a logistical challenge because no great way to keep track of which reports have been deployed onto which systems because they are mean they are there are 4 systems total that ideally should and there are several points of failure the params in the sproc match the params in the the params in the reports table match the params in the or the sproc is updated while the file for whatever what happens when a new report needs a parameter that been coded for in the params all boils down to the system not being dynamic like i i know about but i have a feeling that the guy doing the reports it seems like there must be a better way to keep the sproc and file in and to dynamically ask for the parameters it needs through something like is this normally reports best

have read a ton of posts and articles about all of these languages and the good and bad of i realize that some folks will say another language and frankly i i am genuinely curious about this and i think it is an interesting question for healthy i would like to learn a language that will teach good programming fundamentals while also allowing to get something up ultimately i would like to be able to create sites and web it would also be nice to be able to find some work in the event that i ever reach a level of expertise where that may be a started and switched between several platforms and one problem with a few was all of the required components and modules that were required from different vendors with aptana and zend caused some issues in setting one thing that i really liked about the platform is that it is a cohesive environment with lots and lots of documentation that all works together quite i know that the possibility exists for some cost issues down the road though not sure how applicable this would be to a with smaller while i think is a great language that would teach good is it realistic to gain some level of competence in a shorter period of time given also looked at java and it seemed like it may be overkill for what trying to do though i state that with any seems like a great web development language that a lot of huge sites have been built with but one concern that i keep hearing over and over is the tendency to fall into poor habits with it this is a possibility with all i want one that minimized that potential given a reasonable amount of cost issues seem to be much less of an issue with php and it seems to be ubiquitous with heard great things about python and i went through some tutorials but it seems that been such a pain in the ass getting it to work as a cohesive system the way i know django is supposed to be great but it was also a pain in the ass to get seems enjoyable to learn but does teach the fundamentals the best does it matter in the end if it gets me going plus there seem to be a lot of jobs the way there are with php and would at least be nice to be able to do some freelance work at some is a highly subjective question so apologies for that as well as the length of any help would be much teetering on the verge of concentrating on one of several languages and your guidance would really what language should i learn for web development that allows a novice to get up reasonably quickly and teaches good habits such that it would be somewhat easy to pick up new and php for learning fundamentals and

have used parts of poco now and again and found it to be a very nice i largely abandoned ace a number of years ago but poco contains some of the same patterns i have never had any problems with it so i have to assume it is aspects that i is a pretty well integrated oop hierarchy so the components work well with each it has a much more cohesive feel than something like boost which is rather source code is available and very you need to devote large blocks of time to understand what it is doing at least last i looked at the or be a template wizard stick close to standard exceptions are derived from they reinvent is surprising there is a lot more there than appears at first matter of personal preference but the authors stick pretty much to a one class per header file model so you end up including a lot of different mostly doxygen type api pages and a couple of pdfs pointing to source usable but considering the size of the lib it is initially difficult to figure if you are making the best use of the there is an active community built around i never found the package is maintained by some european based company and they had a wiki but i find it that active or things the downside is pretty i think it is a very good library and would definitely recommend

have worked for quite some time on a project that does essentially what you are looking to we split it by folder is the only so and the pages share a common for it works pretty with a few sure the files are always updated together this is necessary because of the shared code if you update the code all the referenced controls had better exist on the careful about your control references run into some issues where controls were referenced from the wrong resulting in some interesting sometimes hard to i would recommend splitting it into folders instead of using the file naming structure because it also very easily allows you to provide locale specific images and css also it allows you to override the common behavior of a page by just adding the appropriate code behind could do this but then your class names will be strange due to the periods in the file as opposed to

hit this issue about two years ago when i first implemented our swig as soon as we exposed a large amount of code we got to the point where swig would output files so large the compiler could not handle the only way i could get around the issue was to split up the interfaces into multiple modules and to compile them has several each module must know about dependencies in other i have a script to generate the interface files which handles this side of but it adds extra each additional module increases the time that the dynamic linker requires to load in the i have added an file that imports all the so that the fact that the code is split up is transparent to the but what is always visible is the long load currently reviewing our build scripts build process and i wanted to see if i could find a solution to this issue that was better than what i have have one shared library containing all the wrapper anyone know how i can acheive this with seen some custom code written in ruby for a specific where the output is to make this but when i looked at the feasibility for python wrappers it does not look so it possible to split a swig module for but rejoin it when	
hits page which then spawns a rendering pages all using to worry about the fact that is seemingly sending the user 7 responses for 1 that part is handled and only one response gets problem in a enviroment production with many threads we get an string boolean datetime string boolean string duplicate it my coworker believes this is because reusing the original httpcontext and passing it into the other and that not this tried making a new httpcontext to pass into the but parts of it seemingly i need to get the session object into the new i imagine want to get other parts in as like for the record is questions you think the error is from using httpcontext across can i fix the fix is duplicating the httpcontext for each how can i get the session into the new request and response come in the but session is not more going back to this worry about the fact that is seemingly sending the user 7 responses for 1 that part is handled and only one response gets huge fan of raymond i agree with you have two is a reasonable statement in the absence of any more actually happening is that building an excel document to send in the page setting up some state including the fact that rendering to and the object to do the rendering each spawned page gets that and will block until their turn to render to the if literally looks like protected override void if all the processing up to that point database control all done in and a lot of it enough that parrallizing it while still letting it block on render will cut the overall time in over the best part of it is nothing had to be rewritten for the excel all the controls know how to render themselves to and you can visit each spawned page independently the actually the excel report is just an aggregation of all the spawned i figured the end result was going to be do you need to rethink the but i had to at least because the fact that everything works so nicely without duplicating any logic or any code or having to abstract anything is just so and only the if i render the pages serially everything is just an httpcontext across

how hard it is to find information about custom component setup i thought i would clear up some aspects of the process based on what i have the most part aaaidan example above is correct with one loaderinfo property of a displayobject refrences a loaderinfo from which your component gets its parameter settings the init event is called when it has gotten its data you could use the complete which should fire directly after the your setting up properties to be accessed using the metadata you can also define default values what i have experience the parameters seem to have trouble dealing with anything other then a string perhaps so i would suggest using set functions that take string values and use them to obtain the other values you may for example if you want to load a new instance of a specific named function set var as new this example if the parameter is set to calling will create a new sprite you want your custom component to resize in a way other then simply stretching the height and width values you need a public setsize this function will be called every time you resize your component in function this works great when your resizing the component in flash but once you actually publish your swf file you will notice that it switches back to stretching width and height rather then using your setsize function dont know why but thats what it to fix in your oninit function you need to take the width and feed them into your and then reset the scalex and scaley values back to 1 function scalex scaley other functions that need to be run once the parameters are anyone finds a less messy way of doing this let this helps someone get their custom components up and

how to update modelstate in got a simple user submits i want to validate input and in some circumstances i want to fix the error for letting him know that he made an error that is already actionresult if be return return the problem mvc will simply ignore the model passed to the view and will whatever the user typed and not my value because the textbox renderer checkes if there is a modelstate and if not null value is that value is of course the one user typed before i change the behaviour of textbox renderer the only solution i found would be to update the modelstate by the way is to the defaultmodelbinder and override the method that assigns the values from forms to model by simply changing the assignment direction using defaultmodelbinder i have to parse the following code on original implementation of is my solution to updates modelstate using values from used by argument name in action not explicitly protected void string new new model modelname modelstate modeltype valueprovider private class reversedbinder protected override void modelbindingcontext string prefix object val new prefix bool res if imodelbinder binder new object obj2 modelbindingcontext context2 new modelbindingcontext context object obj3 if var prefixkey x new the question am i doing something extremely uncommon or am i missing if the then how could i implement such functionality in a better way existing mvc modelstate with model

httpcontext is part of the i would expect that all static functions are threadsafe but any members are not threadsafe when calling against the same instance of the so hopefuly next time you will anticipate that sharing the httpcontext instance across threads would have there a way you can decouple the operations you need to carry out in parallel from the if they are just loading data and writing to csv that code has no necessary dependency on user control or page once that dependency is you can implement the page with an asynchronous running the parallel operations during between and	
https request through a is different from a standard http a regular http request will use the get a https request needs to use a connect the proxy will merely establish a tunnel to the subsequent messages will be sent directly between the client and the server through the proxy the proxy has no way of interpreting the data flowing in normal proxy am not familiar enough with the vb code to know if that is what is i suspect that it is the easiest way to check is to intercept the message being sent to the make sure that it begins with a

hurdle is developing this so called trust metrics when money is involved you have bugs so imperative if a bug was to be found and someone got a greater share of the money because of the contributors would leave and the project would instantly the first bit of advice is to heavily invest in this trust metrics someone mentioned this in the have to be constantly tweaked and kept up to date as times this is not so why tagged it in your main post is beyond this is shared source which is totally microsoft have a shared source similar to what alex is proposing except people have to sign an nda disclosure and only report maybe alex can research what microsoft have done and take some tips away from really hope it works for the sake alex and his company because he has a lot of eyes watching him at the moment and if successful i can see an explosion of open companies which can only be a good pixel

i have been pulling my hair out troubleshooting this bug i have been and i finally discovered what was causing i had always been under the impression that when i called i would be my activerecord turns out this is partially my objects are saving to the database my activerecord my problem exists because one of my validations modifies one of the children models during the validation process is a scheduling application for a 24 hours therefore when lunches are i check them against the day they are and the next day as well to make sure the user mean for an overnight question is is there a way to actually skip my validations and move straight to the is this normal activerecord behavior or should i be diving deeper into my or am i out of luck and need to my really skip my active record

i hear the term flow based programming i think of ie component processes scheduling is driven primarily by a change to its input this really is lego programming in the sense that the labview platform was used for the latest crop of mindstorm however i disagree that this makes it a less useful programming industrial systems which typically involve data and it fits very what is any control system if not data in transformed to data ie what component in your control scheme would you not prefer to represent as a black box in a bigger if you could do to achieve that level of architectural clarity using other methodologies you might have to draw a data domain class then a problem domain run time class then on top of that a use case and flip back and forth between with flow driven systems you have the luxury of being able to collapse a lot of this information together accurately enough that you can realistically design a system visually once the components are build and question i never had to ask when looking at an application written in labview is piece of code set this as it was inherent and easy to trace backwards from the and also mistakes like multiple untintended writers were impossible to create by only that was true of code written in a more typically procedural

i love and agree with andy and one other approach you may want to consider is to have a typed master all you have to do is add one directive in your aspx mastertype of accessing a control from your master consider accessing a control in your master page from the page this approach makes a lot of sense when you have a header label on your master and want to set its value from each page that uses the not but i think this would be simpler technique with nested master as you would just point the virtualpath to the master containing the control you wish to it might prove to be tricky though if you want to access two one in each respective master

i recall there is a vector table in the beginning of memory space that points to the routine to call when a specific interrupt i may be hitting at too low a level here x86 assembly but at the base level you get your vector installed in that table then your routine is not got any of my old reference material with me so give you the actual calls but be surprised if the official method operated outside of the these days of guis sure there are more appropriate that allow interrupt sharing and all that good ignore much of just seen that you are looking at interrupt 16 and above which are outside of the hardware i moved away from that level of programming before there were any interesting bits of hardware in that space so i only ever dealt with the first 15 irqs 16th being the cascade between leaving it just in case of interest to anyone else

i see what having essentially duplicate c and functions buys suggest keeping the c functions as basic as defining an api with all the primitives exposed and nothing then define the classes at a much higher so a uart would have a meaningful that sort of it would have all necessary data the classes would not expose all possible in order to do something write a new member function or class or calling the c the approach in systems like occi oracle call and mfc and and it works	
i see your source code it is quite hard to help especially since the performance of a wpf application is influenced by a lot of for some hints on what to look out for see wpf application and yes it greatly matters what xaml is used in each because usually performance problems do boil down to many did you know that a textbox are i think 30 individual i recommend you use the profiling tools for to find out more about your specific try to minimize the amount of elements you are using by switching from textbox to textblock where you have to check if the performance problems exist on any pc you try the application maybe the pc you are using is forcing wpf into software based or are you using any at your code i would suggest you change a reasonable fixed since the datagrid does not have to recalculate the width dynamically every time something changes adding or even

i the anonymous checkbox in so as to password protect a by restricting read access to designated windows does the resulting password dialogue which is then presented to all anonymous http represent a security risk in that it offers all and sundry an unlimited number of attempts to guess at any windows account not much joy with this so so attaching a just 50 points i am a man of modest to clarify what does disabling anonymous access in iis offer a password guessing opportunity to the public which did not exist or is it the case that the user credentials dialogue can be simulated by including a username and password in a http request and that the response would indicate whether the combination was correct even though the page was open to anonymous users are incorrect password attempts submitted via http subject to the same lockout policy enforced for internal and if so does this represent a very easy opportunity to deliberately lock out known or if is there anything that can be done to mitigate this unlimited password guessing disabling anonymous access in iis create a security

i think much about but always on my biggest problem always had with parallel processing is determing what should be easy to a thread to background process a but can the file processing itself be think the questions of what can and should be parallelized are answered with complex architectural decisions layered on top of the already complex architectural decisions of the application in my belief is that this complexity will be solved either by the os or by the programming the traditional thread model of parallelization found in c and its descendants is not the final

i think the cast where runtime type is should allowed if d is a c and the difference to c are added this should be should it at if you could make this then you could compile code that attempted to call one of the on this which would fail at runtime since that method does not exist in think you are imagining that the cast would detect the methods that are from c and delegate them to d i doubt that would be although i speak to the language design seems to me the solution to your problem class which extends c and implements a constructor which essentially clones the state of the given c object into a new d d object can be passed to your existing code because it is a and it can be passed to code that wants an i because it is an

i took a step back and realized that what really doing is trying to create a method that will return the value of a public property by passing the the property rather then manually creating a relationship between a property in my class and a string that coincidentally has the same name figured that better to do that what doing and it seems to in i have to worry about two classes trying to define duplicate property keys because a derived class already have a duplicate property name to one in its base class unless there is an explicit public type t properties keys new foreach pnfo in return public string allowablekeys string returnvalue if type t propertyinfo prop returnvalue return

i understand i think the problem here is that trying to solve the problem using a very simple what you need to be doing is creating your own workflow system for such a task and also try to separate out some of the logic from the ui handling mvc framework would be ideal for though i see you are using which nonetheless a big now this necessarily need to be start off by breaking down the actions performed by your application into some sort of flow if you can see pretty straightforward then it may just be a matter of implementing a basic state as a general pointer to dealing with states in web applications all have a read through some of the links on afraid i really provide you with anything more specific from what described missing something obvious if like to clarify the tasks that your app needs to then i might be able to give some code but i suspect that just treating this problem a flow perspective should give you a good

i understand the problem of finding the longest simple path in a graph is since you could then easily solve the hamiltonian circuit problem by setting edge weights to 1 and seeing if the length of the longest simple path equals the number of question what kind of path would you get if you took a found the maximum edge replaced each edge weight with and ran a standard shortest path algorithm on clearly not the longest simple since if it then np and i think the proof for something like that would be a bit more complicated simple

i understand you you have 3 tables structured as int not int not not in int not int not not in int not int not null in or you are trying to do is define such that you could cascade updates and deletes between the because of how and are you will guarantee that there is no overlap between the problem is figuring out which table has the reference to you can do with this definition is cascade from or to since the relationship is quite clear in that to cascade from up is more since you know which table to cascade either define two fields in one to reference each of the other and then you can define the relationship between all three knowing that for any given record there will only be one or two tables never all you can use code to figure out which table to relate this particular row to and cascade

ideal rule is that each of your layers should be a black box and none of them should depend on validation of another the reason behind this is that the db has no idea of the ui and vice so when the db throws an the ui must have db knowledge to convert that into something the ui layer can so it can eventually convert it into something the can making validation on every layer is also my either put the validation in a single place the business and make the other layers really they check anything write your validation in an abstract way into the model and then generate all validation from for namedesc new new new you can write code which examines the description stuff code or even at and do the validation in each layer with little cost because one change fixes all for you only have these some some error you should be able to get away with these exception classes which have value plus special info like the limit that was so wondering where your many exception classes come your other this is uh by the phase commit i say because there are situations when the protocol breaks down and in my much better to give the user a dialog or some other means to fix the problem rather than investing a lot of time into

implementing any sort of metrics ask what is it you want to measure productivity are you not listening but why is this important humans in metrics will innevitably try to optimize it for their own knowing you should be able to use this optimization in your yourself then if someone optimize the what will they be concentrated on direct your metric in measuring someting that will positively effect the thus instead of measuring bugs per programmer which only gives amunition to management to fire if things go try to measure where and why the bugs not who made bugs per bugs per bugs per code bugs per feaures would be much more productive metrics and will help identify of course you can always tie it to someone as there is always an indirect link to a but before you place a programmer on the forefront of the blame war you better be darn sure is the yourself what kind of environment you want to create what will the reaction of the directors will be when faced with the publication you measure and make them look bad then you are asking for if you peasure product then the focus will not be on making themselves look good but making the product look this in turn will be a much better motivator and will foster positive team your metric any sort of information hiding will cause adverse reaction and thus if you publicize your metrics be carefull on what they if you really isist on measuring people then measure them directors veryone should have the same then hide the knives and place metal detectors on the cause transparency with people ina company only works one from the top looking

important point that i think people here are missing is that with a database that supports parameterized there is no to worry the database engine combine the bound variables into the sql statement and then parse the whole the bound variables are kept separate and never parsed as a generic sql where the security and speed comes the database engine knows the placeholder contains data so it is never parsed as a full sql the speedup comes when you prepare a statement once and then execute it many the canonical example being inserting multiple records into the same in this the database engine needs to only one gotcha is with database abstraction they sometimes fake it by just inserting the bound variables into the sql statement with the proper that is better than doing it

in need of a datastructure that is basically a list of data where each data point has a timestamp and a of data i want to be able to retrieve the closest point to a given timestamp or all points within a specified range of using my thinking was using a regular list would be where is a class that contains the timestamp and then to use the to find where to insert the new and i could use it again to find the indexes for a range first tried but it seems like you iterate through indexes just through so i sure how to do the range search without some convoluted then i learned that is i do better than that without sacrificing is there some nice linq query that will do everything i want in a single data structure for sorted time series data that can quickly return

in the case of or any class that has mutable variants or strongly recommend copying the parameter instead of retaining if the string the caller passed you was an its value could change and it will change in your class as this is probably not what you so advise doing method makes a copy and sets the retain count to so all set as far as retaining the variable is as an extra if the caller does pass you an that class is smart enough to know that its value so it simply retains itself to avoid making a copy of the how clever is

in the world are you using the literals in your sql there is zero chance that have so why use forces a distinct to occur and little slower than since you have something that looks like no possibility that ever have it to union all and your query will perform much is fundamental sql writing a well tuned query is more important than creating view start with the understand tune your then worry about spending space and slowing dml to improve query literals in the query prevent dupes between the only remaining possibility is dupes within a since the columns look like pks and there are no joins that could induce duplication and since the tables all look like lookup what i said is if that assumption true than you have a legitimate use of union without an however i find that of the time people really meant to use all and a standard at our company to add a comment to sql with only union because so often a union yes i need a distinct

insertion order must is any data structure so avoid or data or trees for then you use one of those but then you have to keep track of its insertion order in each must be unique database objects that are identified by a a unique identifier associated with each if this is a c then the pointer to that node is unique guess this applies in java as if the pointer is not sufficient to maintain then you need to add a field to each node which you gaurantee to have a unique if a newer object with the same is the older version of object should be do you want to place the do you want to the existing or do you want to delete the old then add the new one to the this is important because it is related to your requirement where the order of insertion must be the solution should be by many only way i can think of to do this is to implement some sort of java lets you wrap strucutres and code within an when the first object added to structure is it should removed from the data like a like an arraylist is a pretty good option for simply because of the only problem is that searches are but if you have a relatively small amount of then it really that much of a like others have a hashmap or even a tree of some sort would work but that will depend on the frequency of if the element is most likely to be use a linear but if accesses will be of go with a hashmap or

is a good idea to include a security descriptor for each resource and not only to a in your example the security descriptor is simply id or a list of if you support duets so i would think about adding the list of ids to both the artists and the songs you can add a string field where the artist ids for the resource will be written in solution scales you can add more layers without increasing time needed for security adding a new resource also require any additional penalty except for one more field to insert on parent and of this solution supports special situations described above more than one artists kind of solution also violate restful the fact that each resource contains its own security descriptor generalizes the access making it possible to implement some completely different security policy in future making access permissions more based on not only

is a lot of enthusiasm around mvc right but if you are starting a new dev project right now still recommend that you carefully consider before jumping on the mvc train just most dev teams on any there are some serious here are the ones i find most requires much more skill from your they will need significant expertise in the inner workings of as well as a good understanding of how http for the client side code they will need strong javascript and jquery and on the server side an advanced grasp of oo and if you plan to get the most from experience with unit testing and mocking frameworks mvc framework currently get much in the way of rad features from visual you get a text editor and but about no no no property while this really that it does often mean that building uis will take significantly especially for less experienced is very and so code and sample apps are very hard to come by and tend to be very limited in documentation is also a bit thin at the biggest drawback to the mvc framework is the lack of an established and mature 3rd party market around with web forms there are tons of very advanced ui suites and components on the market and tons of open source projects you can borrow many especially business apps the lack of 3rd party and advaned grid controls for the mvc framework alone should be a major is and i highly recommend it if you are in a position where you can use but there are real costs and risks for any significantly complex project that may keep you on web forms for a while do expect that the next major version of mvc will probably address many of those especially with the lack of rad i also expect that the enthusiasm around mvc will bring a lot of 3rd party support to the platform but it will take some time for all that to get well	
is a major ideally your database server should be sitting behind a firewall with only the ports required to perform data access your web application should be connecting to the database server with a sql account that has just enough rights for the application to function and no for example you should remove rights that permit dropping of objects and most certainly you be connecting using accounts such as the event that you lose the web server to a hijack a full blown privilege escalation to administrator the worst case scenario is that your database may be compromised but not the whole database server would be the case if the database server and web server were the same if encrypted your database connection strings and the hacker savvy enough to decrypt them then all lost is the web

is called a calling the parameterless and then calling tmp new intlist requirements for the type implements has overloads of which are appropriate for the argument types you you can supply multiple arguments in in which case the compiler looks for an method with multiple class dummycollection ienumerator throw new a real public void public void int can then foo new 2 normally want your collection to implement	
is called when it exits the using statement because explicitly called by that the dispose method called explicitly when the variable goes out of scope behavior you may observe that looks like that is that usually things that implement idisposable also call the dispose method in the classes and the destructor could be called soon after the variable goes out of but not the destructor is invoked by the garbage

is definitely due to string hash codes are calculated when comparing references with the section string literal does necessarily result in a new when two or more literals that are equivalent to the string equality appear in the same these string literals refer to same string that string count as literals in this x y guaranteed that and refer to the same object too they are the same the spec says by the it really means the behaviour of equal strings in different assemblies depends on things like and the precise clr implementation and execution time situation whether the assembly is or

is directly implemented in assembly because you cannot control stack layout directly from high level note that most implementation will perform some additional optimization like aligning the stack for performance standard way of allocating stack space on x86 looks like xxx is the number of bytes to you want to look at the implementation using see and code in the first file basically aligns the desired allocation size to a 16 byte code in the 2nd file actually walks all pages which would belong to the new stack area and touches this will possibly trigger exceptions which are used by the os to grow the

is due to the different way that the clr handles structs and structs are value types which means they live on the stack rather than in the managed it is a good rule of thumb to keep structs small because once you start passing them as method arguments you will incur overhead as structs are copied in their entirety when passed to a classes pass a copy of their reference to methods they incur much less overhead when used as method best way to determine the size of your class is to total the number of bytes required by all the members of your class plus an extra 8 bytes for clr overhead stuff sync block index and the reference to the type of the

is entirely implementation depends on the hardware as much as but also on the age of the for anyone with a reasonably modern compiler anything based on a standard from the early or the size argument is a this can reasonably be the largest 16 bit the largest 32 bit or the largest 64 bit depending on the memory model the compiler compiles in this you just have to find out what size a is in your for old compilers before and for some early versions of ansi all bets are the standards looking at cygwin and solaris for the size argument is a looking at an embedded system that i have the size argument is an compiler for this embedded system was written in the i found a web reference to some ansi c the size parameter is an may want to see on as well as the about a of some early gcc versions where was erroneously for will be the correct reference to for those few using embedded systems or legacy systems with very old you need to check your man

is kind of but is part of the increasingly neglected pyxml extension if you want to stay within the using the statement as mentioned by david to make it slightly use mode to avoid unwanted crlf newlines on windows interfering with encodings like because xml has its own mechanisms for handling newline it should be treated as a binary file rather than you include the argument either writexml or try to write a unicode string direct to the so if there are any characters in get a try to the results of toprettyxml for encodings this can generate no but trivially simple to do it as

is no clear answer whether sql portability is desirable or not it really depends a lot on the such as the type of the application is going to be a service ie there will only ever be you hosting then obviously nobody but you will care whether your sql is portable so you could safely ignore it as long as you have no specific plans to drop support for your current the application is going to be installed at a number of which each have their own established database obviously sql portability is very important to it lets you widen your potential and may give a bit of piece of mind to clients who are on the fence in regards to their database whether you want to support or you are happy selling only for oracle or only to for is up to you and what you think your market you are coding in then the vast majority of your potential customers are probably going to expect if then not a big deal to assume or similarly if you are in then you could assume microsoft sql there is a flip side because there may exist a small but less competitive market of php or users who want to connect to other database systems than the i would largely regard this as a market research unless as in my first example you are providing a hosted service where it matter to in which case it is for your own convenience	
is no correct and definitive answer to your it depends on what you are going to if it is to maintain some sort of code learning awk and sed makes if it is just for personal pleasure that is also if it is to maintain a script that nobody can because nobody knows and sed then it does not make sense to learn the languages and if you can rewrite the script with proper testing and reproduce it with no bugs then learning a new language does not make with regards to your time more than on scripting language works well since in most cases people are not too familiar with in which case they would most likely know at least also if you are on a team where most people know then it would make sense to learn those believe that learning something new that you can get to use in your daily life as a developer not only adds value to your skill set but also helps keeping the mind

is no expert who can give you a rule that works in all places at all i have been known in my industry for years for interfaces and won significant amounts of business for it well as 5 in i have also had people within my company and outside of it tell me for years that they like my work but wish that i would it with more graphics and what always amazes me is how little connection people see between the few rules of page should do one page may well have multiple links related to the main thing and link layout should be consistent across is better than more should be visually appealing and inviting 4 is more important than rule my product provides an interface that lets people define classes and events to be displayed in a i have one page that lets you delete and edit the in some simpler used the gridview to let people manage everything in a classes have too much information to do this and still follow the rules is a list of classes for this links are shown above and to the right of the change and delete are links within each this is consistent across the for the system as a whole is always across the nothing else appears on the page except for standard elements common to all pages a a grid is nicely styled but there are no spurious graphics few last things about uis and graphic develop your own vision and be consistent across pages and do not be afraid of when soliciting advice from others keep in mind that you do not want their advice you want their you want to understand the way they the advice is sometimes good more often than actually in my everyone thinks that they are a ui you do your hallway useability testing you should discount almost all advice to the effect that should make stand out as it will quickly become if you follow this end up with a mess due to first rule of everything is important than nothing you when explaining why you make someone stand out just tell them that violates first rule of this

is not a real answer to you but probably a solution to solve the use an implementation of sql lite for my integration i build up the schema and fill the database before each the schema creation and initial data filling happens really fast then seconds per because an do you use a physical response to answer about question because i migrated my schema and data directly from sql server 2005 and i want it to persist in source recommend to store a file with the database schema in and a file or script that creates the sample data in source you can generate the file using sql server studion management you can generate it from your nhibernate mappings or you can use a tool like sql compare and you can probably find other solutions for this when you need plain text files are stored easier in version control systems then complete binary database does something about the sqlite engine differ such that it would resolve this might solve your problems because you can recreate your database before each your database under test will be in a the state you expect it to be before each test is a benefit of that is there is no need to roll back your but i have run similar test with in memory sqllite and it worked as

is really only a follow up to john great it can be safe to make stateless methods are pretty much it can sometimes lead to coupling that is hard to consider you have a static method as class staticclassversionone public static void you call is all well and and very until you come across a case where you have to modify the behaviour of the static and find that you are tightly bound to possibly you could modify the code and it would be but if there was other callers dependent on the old need to be accounted for in the body of the in some cases that method body can get pretty ugly or unmaintainable if it tries to balance all these if you split out the methods you may have to modify code in several places to take account of or make calls to new consider if you had created an interface to provide the and given it to now when the behaviour has to a new class can be created to implement the which is more easily and more and that instead is given to the in this scenario the calling classes need to be altered or even and the changes are may or it may not be a likely but i think it is worth

is several things together kind of a virtual combined with different frontends that take the input in a particular language and output the result in an intermediate this intermediate output can be run with the virtual or can be used to generate a standalone problem with concurrency is although it was used for a long time in scientific it has just recently has become common in consumer so while widely known how to program a scientific calculation program to achieve great it is completely different thing to write a mail user processor that can be good at most of the current were being designed with a single processor in and they may not be fully prepared for multicore benefit of llvm with respect to concurrency is that you have an intermediate and if in the future there are advances in then by updating your interpreter you instantly gain those benefits in all this is not so easy if you had compiled to a standalone so llvm solve the concurrency problem per se but it leaves an open door for future there are more possible advances for the hardware like quantum genetics but we have to wait for them to become a

is slicehost using to serve options are things or called passenger phusion or like are dedicated servers plugins to which run an instance of your rails your host using then probably defaulting to rails comes with a simple cgi script that will serve the but it reloads the app for every i suspect that this is the most likely that your app is running off of the cgi in which would explain the this tends to be a default deployment on many since it require extra configuration on their but it give good your host supports rails supports that fast cgi will open a cgi and keep it open for multiple so you get much better but not nearly as good as mongrel or is it in or the easy way to tell is to go to a page in your app that gives an if it shows you a stack in development which is slower than production mongrel and have startup options to determine whether to run the app in production or development if your database is slow for whatever that will be a big bottleneck as if you do have a good deployment in production try looking into

is the underlying architectural principle of the the amazing thing about the web is the fact that clients and servers can interact in complex ways without the client knowing anything beforehand about the server and the resources it the key constraint is that the server and client must both agree on the which in the case of the web is api that adheres to the principles of does not require the client to know anything about the structure of the the server needs to provide whatever information the client needs to interact with the an is an example of the server specifies the location of the and the required browser know in advance where to submit the and it know in advance what information to both forms of information are entirely supplied by the principle is called how does this apply to and how can it be implemented in http is oriented around verbs and the two verbs in mainstream usage are get and which i think everyone will the http standard defines several others such as put and these verbs are then applied to according to the instructions provided by the imagine that we have a user database that is managed by a web our service uses a custom hypermedia based on for which we assign the mimetype might also be an and many media types may be the client and the server has both been programmed to understand this but they know anything about each as points rest api should spend almost all of its descriptive effort defining the media used for representing resources and application or in defining extended relation names for existing standard media request for the base resource might return something like know from the description of our media that we can find information about related resources from sections called this is called in this we can tell from such a section that we can find a user list by making another request for can tell a lot from this for we now know we can create a new user by posting to also know that we can change existing that we are using different http verbs delete to manipulate these and that the only knowledge we presume on the clients part is our media many much better answers on this very i explained rest to my api has hypermedia answer has been subject of a fair amount of criticism for missing the for the most that has been a fair what i originally described was more in line with how rest was usually implemented a few years ago when i first wrote rather than its true revised the answer to better represent the real

it does make sense in this use cases differ here in that they cannot be used in the same use cases will be usefull to extract and formalize was workinng in a ui lab a while back and we toyed with this though we did not call it as basic idea here is that we would use agile iterative approach to development where we would use usability tesing to help converge on a desired cycle would be a few requirements and use very limited in scope very a test protocol that would allow us to gather data on this feature ease of performace or expand the application to include this a few users test the application using agile adaptation of usability testing handbook of usability where we would limit test sessions to 15 minutes with a 15 minutes usefull data from testing to inject in future method was perticularely usefull when the users would either not know exactly what they wanted or could not tell we would therefore have to devise tests that would gather objective data on the actuall usefulness of the software to the user and try to ajust the next iteration of our if i may call them so were heavily handicapped and could not talk so we had to be way of working forced us to have a gui available to the client very early in the development life and because it was the central point where we would direct testing one could say it was gui driven desing since the driving force for convergence was the user interactions with the we developped this technique mostly for very specific cases we did some testing with normal users on a normal software and got very positive the desing would converge very quickly towards the also the fact that they participated in this desing approach had also very positive effects on the acceptance of the product in the target internal strifes had the lab dismanteled before we could publish our results and expand this line of a shame uidd you pardon the bad would be a member of the tdd family of approaches towards software development where the iterations hinges around user reading on the subject

it is calling the function on a yet not constructed which is undefined you detect it i would argue you also should not try to detect nothing which would happen likely by compared to for example calling a function on an already deleted trying to catch every and all possible mistakes is just about the name declared is visible already in its for other useful consider is a common idiom in c and which still works in i like by herb sutter about null references are likewise the gist try to protect from cases that the language clearly forbids and in particular are in their general case impossible to diagnose you will get a false security over which becomes quite train your understanding of the language and design interfaces in a way raw that reduces the chance of doing and likewise in many cases are not explicitly but rather are left partially because some things are rather difficult to diagnose and partially because undefined behavior lets the implementation design alternative behavior for it instead of completely ignoring it which is used often by existing the above case for any implementation is free to throw an there are other situations that are likewise undefined behavior which are much harder to diagnose efficiently for the having an object in a different translation unit accessed before it was constructed is such an example which is known as the initialization order

it simply a query based storephone as phone from altphone as phone from phone from altphone can be you could add a where clause to eliminate the not clear what you mean by ani or you can obviously add extra columns to the different result sets as long as the net is the union eliminates duplicate rows a phone number already exists in the destination do not add then you need the merge you would merge into your target table using a minor variation of the query above as the source of for the statement from the sql 2003 standard merge into as correlation using on operation correlation operation when when when matched when not matched when matched when matched then update when not matched when not matched then insert update update set clause insert insert column values insert value insert value insert value insert value insert value typed value can also find descriptions of this statement in the relevant product which often offers more in your probably omit the when matched using only the when not matched sql server 2005 does not support the only dbms i know of with that are faced with creating a temporary table and loading it with the data from the can then do inserts into your main data table from the temp table based on the of the corresponding row in the main data at some dbms allow you to do not an ms sql server so i know whether the fine print of the update statement prevents you from selecting from the table being updated in of the update that can be a real nuisance if you are so option is to unload the table to plain and unload the data to plain and then use options to deal with how feasible that is depends on the volume of which perl can be useful reading the main table into a hash and then selectively updating it from the and finally rewriting the data to a load then you start the drop all the old load all the new and and the downside of this is that changes made between unload and load are so be careful if you decide to use this you might want to do the unload in the and modify the and then delete and reload all in the same single it will need to be a single to do the whole

its possible to get progress callbacks from the python module i would suggest finding out how many bytes are processed pr second by simply storing where in the file you where at start of the and where you are at the end when you have the data on how fast the computer your on you can off course save and use it as a basis for your next zip i normally collect about 5 samples before showing a time prognosses this method can give you minutes so as you get more samples you would need to average it this would esp be the case if your making a zip file that contains a lot of as zip tends to slow down when compressing many small files compared to 1 large

itself have but all rdbms sql extensions not really sure how that alone would solve your a transaction will do the trick effectively grouping your 2 unrelated statements the default transaction level will rdbms default transaction level is read that prevent user 2 from reading the same row that user 1 for need to use repeatable read or is a classic concurrency the 2 ways of handling it are pessimistic locking or optimistic a repeatable read transaction would be pessimistic the locking expense whether or not it was and checking is optimistic but doing something sensible when we use optimistic is and either use a timestamp or combination of fields read to ensure that changing the data we my suggestion is to include a rowversion or timestamp and pass that back in to your update check to see if you updated any if you then go back and pick another in rowversion top 1 rowversion from messages where user is rowsaffected messages set user where messageid and rowversion throw new message was taken by someone on your particular you may be able to get away with just repeating the is where clause in your update similar to solution but still must check to see if rows were actually

java language is what it you find much to change the core language without moving to a new language getting from management might not be as hard as you think to move to i was in a similar position as you a few years you can start introducing groovy into a few areas of your software that make great place to start is to start using it for unit essentially when you write a class in it compiles down to java as long as you have the groovy jars on your others may not even know it is groovy by using it for you can demonstrate how it simplifies your code and makes things you should be able to sell that to keep introducing it in other new areas where a dynamic language would save you some groovy and java mix very well together since they use the same set of core

keyword and lambdas do involve the creation of hidden classes at compile time and the allocation of extra objects at and if your background is in c or then only natural to be concerned about but tried measuring the for lambdas with closure over local and found it to be so incredibly small matter of that it would be of no significance in almost all	
keyword in c actually serves two functions depending on where those functions are visibility and duration are my terms based on quite a bit of the if interested in that level of uses different terms which i often find confuses new hence my reticence in using used at file it marks an item or as so that a linker cannot see this is static as in duration is the same as the program until the program this is useful for encapsulating the item within a single compilation unit source in its simplest the item is available to the whole compilation unit declared before used within a it controls duration is limited to within the in this the item is also created once and endures until the program variables within a function are created and destroyed on function entry and gather what after is the first basically a global variable since i immediately see much of a use for the other variant in be done in must belong to a the workaround is to create a class holding the and that object around so you can reference its a singleton item so you can access its

know if with newer versions of builder and some probably guess it probably but why on earth would you want end up with a version of mysql compiled in an untested environment instead of the distribution versions provided by mysql themselves that gain lots of testing i think of a single advantage of doing but i can think of plenty of your problem is that builder is the only development environment you have to be aware that you can compile using visual which ms will give you for you really want to go about doing be wanting build and following their instructions for visual studio will work to get you something you can start then need to hack around looking for appropriate compiler options and so

know of existing libraries that do everything you assuming going to need to implement xml or json based on bean properties is pretty at using apache commons beanutils to be able to get all property values in the propertyutils beanutils recursively to walk your entire object graph be careful of cycles need a set or something on the side to keep track of what already look at xmlencoder it works using javabean properties to create one approach might be to use existing libs json or to create objects then deal with merging the properties between the xmldecoder class can read bean xml you create it using the tricky part to this approach is to know when a value has been to null vs just not been set in the this approach also has the extra overhead of creating a bunch of new reading json or xml is a little but not too assume you already have some means of indexing the objects you want to merge into a map of some assume you already have some means to know which property is the key that uniquely identifies an object assume last name is just to get the point as it would make a bad for this type of recommend a sax reader for the xml need a stack to keep track of which objects adding data the sax reader tells you what tags are seen and then gives the values for those you could also use xml pull which tends to be a little take a look at some of the open source json libraries and do some json is pretty simple to and these tools tend to be pretty small so this be a big you could write an antlr other parser to read the json and do with it as you

know the exact reason why you need to do i think it would be better to pass the whole object instead of one of its i used this approach in the called an object persistence uses it extensively and gives you a good example of how it visitor pattern and the relatively but it proved very useful to even when i use note step 3 in the titled instead of passing a method we will pass an to answer your if you use visitor then you have an interface implementing multiple but just one then have a class for each like and you pass an instance of such classes to the object to be in such you have to know what to you just call and it will do the you can find a basic procedure procedure execute procedure execute procedure implement action implement action visited visitor	
know the microsoft guidelines recommends using the to describe it as an but this comes from ibm naming conventions if not remember the initiating for interfaces and the succeeding for the in my opinion the java naming conventions is a better choice than the ibm naming convention not only in for as well and any oo programming interfaces describes what an object can be able to do if it implements the interface and the description should be in verb imho this is a perfect description of what the interface

know the tools thank for the time you take to test to be very try totally agree with you is not a leak but is a memory if you run the application with at the beginning the application takes 7 mo and each time you go in a child it takes 1 mo of memory 10 the application takes 20 the application takes 27 mo so at the end the application crash i remember an application cannot takes more than and this application follow the apple rules in term of memory my when you go in a child it takes one 1mo of but when you come back to the the 1mo of memory is you can go in another child coming the memory is the problem is if you go again in a child table you already the application looking for a solution to force the application to release the memory after visiting a child order to with the have follow the memory used by the apple settings application table view application you go in a child it takes 1 mo of but when you come the memory is

knowing what your model looks i can only assume that what doing is pushing blobs of binary data to the server and you want to push the entire blob back at asking why in this scenario you would want to do a basic pattern where you take the data trying to split it into you send a chunk with a sequence number to the server and continue sending chunks asynchronously in whatever order you feel when the server has received all of the chunks this possibly by you already having sent a to the it can commit all those chunks to a database or disk or you are dealing with rows of data rather than chunks of binary data the pattern is still fairly regardless of your ajax implementation the goal would be to determine how many rows you plan on sending set up some kind of progress bar that updates and then continually invoke a method that submits one row of changed each time you do that you can then inch the progress bar forward and allow the user to remain fully aware of the progress of the pattern should work regardless of how storing your underlying	
knowing which app you guess probably a realsqldatabase which is used by realbasic	
knowing your full application it is hard to say what the best way to approach the problem but a common technique is to use a header which starts with a fixed length which denotes the length of the rest of your that your header consist only of a 4 byte integer which denotes the length of the rest of your then simply do the this assumes buffer is at least x bytes and that the socket is unsigned int int bytesread int while result buffer x if 1 throw your bytesread later in the int length buffer we assume that will return 4 new then process the data as makes a few are the same size on the sender and is the same on both the sender and have control of the protocol on both you send a message you can calculate the length up it is common to want to explicitly know the size of the integer you are sending across the network define them in a header file and use them explicitly such these typedefs will vary across different such as but the is that a int8 is always 8 and a uint32 is 32 bits regardless of the platform you are these vary from compiler to so you have to look them up in the compiler char short int int unsigned char unsigned short int unsigned int would change the above length buffer new hope this

lists are implemented using free solutions exist for singly and doubly linked lists but there are no lock free solutions which directly using only cas for any data can however use cas based lists to create skip that which is created using permits arbitrary data structures and a proof of concept tree had been created using odd as they they turn out to be very useful	
lists offer several advantages over comparable data structures such as static or dynamically expanding dose not require contiguous blocks of memory and therefore help reduce memory fragmentation support efficient removal of elements arrays usually force a shift in all of the support efficient addition of elements arrays can cause a copy if a particular add exceeds the current place where these advantages would be significantly valuable to a program the disadvantages of a linkedlist were would be a place to use a

looking for a good data structure to build equivalence classes on nodes of a in an ideal the following operations should be fast as and easy paragraphs of mystery walk the tree from the on each node child transition enumerate all the equivalent versions of the child merge two equivalence create new nodes from a list of existing nodes and other find any nodes structurally equivalent to node they have the same number of corresponding children belong to the same equivalence and their is so that new newly nodes may be put in the right equivalence class a far considered of these could be used in where the children are references to collections of nodes instead of to is requires walking the tree and updating nodes to point to the merged requires finding the collection containing each child of the new requires walking the a hash of nodes by their this makes much faster but slower the hash would have to be updated when equivalence classes were the nodes together into a circular linked is would be fast but for the fact that that part of a circular list with itself actually splits the list would be would require walking the but with an additional pointer in each which could be used to find a canonical member of the circular i missing a sweet a good data structure for building equivalence classes on nodes of a	
looking for a good parser generator that i can use to read a custom format in our large commercial currently this particular file format is read with a handmade recursive parser but the format has grown and complexified to the point where that approach has become seems like the ultimate solution would be to build a proper grammar for this format and then use a real parser generator like yacc to read but having trouble deciding which such generator to use or even if worth the trouble at looked at antlr and but our project has specific constraints beyond that make me wonder if as appropriate for in i parser that generates c or code with antlr 3 support it claims to generate straight c but the docs on getting it to actually work are sort of constrained memory memory is at a huge premium in our app and even tiny leaks are i need to be able to override the memory allocator to use our custom or at the very least i need to give it a contiguous pool from which it draws all its memory which i can deallocate en bloc i can spare about 200kb for the parser executable but whatever dynamic heap it allocates in parsing has to get freed this is less critical but we ought to be able to parse 100kb of text in no more than a second on a 3ghz be we use gnu like ide and debugging but it looks like getting its c target to actually work with our app will be a huge before i embark on that is antlr the right tool for this text format in question looks something real foo bar model animation references attribute fluxcapacitance 10 asset the antlr parser generator best for a app with constrained

looking for some feedback on the advantages and disadvantages of the methods available for creating individual development branches in a perforce if i understand there are two ways of handling the first is to create a private which is a complete copy of the branch that you are working the branch would completely stand on its own and completely isolate your changes from the target other method that heard recommended is sparse it is described in this creates a but only with the files that you will need to you then overlap the target branch client view with this sparse dev branch client methods would require the programmer to perform some integration work in order to get their changes in the target the private branch method seems like it would require a lot more additional memory in order to create a copy of the whole the perforce documentation states that it performs a in this also enables perforce to perform a of the when you the server does not actually hold two copies of the files it merely holds the source file and a pointer in the database records the fact that the branch to the target file has lazy copies make branching a the server have to keep track of duplicate copies of makes it seem like the sparse branch method is just adding the possibility of human error to the process for the developer may start working on a file that they add to the sparse branch and then accidentally update a change to the target branch that breaks the the sparse branching functionality exists for a any feedback on why it exists and why i should be using it over a complete private branch vice would be greatly dev branches sparse branching private

main argument for method 2 is that you get implicit type conversion on both not just the second this might save confusion somewhere down the of your example code defines implicit conversions from int to a and from int to via the constructors on both this could result in ambiguity but if you left out the for fair agree with if you find yourself doing you may be writing an api that others will find how come an a plus a b is an does it really make things easier for users that they are adding a and rather than calling getx themselves and adding the it because users know perfectly well that a and b are wrappers for if then another option is to expose conversions from a to int and b to via operator then will return an int for a sensible and get all the other arithmetic operators a int explicit operator return b int explicit operator return a b a b a b

main reason i would avoid this typedef is that it allows the type to lie to the take vs both type names encode the size of the value into the this is not an uncommon practice in i personally use the size specific typedefs to avoid confusion for myself and other people reading my much of our code has to run on both 32 and 64 bit platforms and many people know the various sizing rules between the types like eliminate the i had not read the 4th paragraph of your question and instead just saw the type i would have assumed it was some scenario specific way of having a fast 16 bit and i obviously would have been wrong for me it would violate the surprise rule of if it had another distinguishing acronym in the name it would be less likely to confuse maybe

may not directly answer your but i wanted to throw in what learned when using sprite sprite sheets are great because the fewer textures that the gpu has to switch between when drawing to the the better would recommend that you take a look at the sprite sheet if you it offers a couple great automatically packs your sprites different into one big i thought keeping my artwork in separate files and having the one giant sprite sheet generated automatically would be better than keeping all my art in one what if i decide i want my animations to have an extra frame in the then i have to shift around a bunch of stuff in the sprite sheet to make room for the new if using one file per just a one line change to the xml file listing what goes into the sprite sheet if i want to add a new frame in the can be a pain to list every frame file so i can see why this may not work for some but it was great for my i found that the gain of being able to swap textures in and out of my sprite sheet easily was more than worth which will help you as you determine what size of sprites to ran into a when scaling i believe that link describes the issue pretty in any this sprite sheet example will automatically add a 1 pixel border the color of the pixel that was originally on the around each sprite you add to the sprite which will protect you from seeing oddly colored borders around your sprites when because it still only draws the sprite using the original it just uses the extra border for interpolation instead of a nearby pixels or white is correct that there really any standard sprite size you should it depends mostly on what type of game you are what type of scaling and rotating you are there are specific sizes you need to watch for when using sprite sprite sheets are just one giant but there is a limit to how big of a texture can hold in their the xbox360 supports up to 4096x4096 if programming for then it depends on the graphics from what probably best to stick with 2048x2048 on because most graphics cards can support at least that last note on the sprite sheet i believe that it will watch for a maximum sprite sheet so if you do use you may want to add a couple lines to catch when the size of the generate texture is larger than you want to

method i used on a fairly large form was to just reload the form with basically making a call back to the server and just returning the fields with their default this made is much easier than trying to grab each field with js and then setting it to default it also allowed to me to keep the default values in one on this there were also some different defaults depending on the settings for the account and therefore i have to worry about sending these to the only small issue i had to deal with were some suggest fields that required initialization after the ajax but not a big

method would have advantages in extending orders with further as well as instrumenting changes but not recommend the is about collecting behaviours specific to distinct states in separate not about how to present stateful interfaces to other think about the business events which come naturally shipping invoice and design an explicit interface around exactly how you design the interface depends on how your application logic is and how it is used from other the classic answer is to define abstract methods for each business event if using you might decide to go with incoming and outgoing events from your order or you could try try some mixture or combination the main point is that a interface very and is likely to lead to a clumsy implementation methods in each of your orderstate a method internal to your classes from each of your specific methods or could be ok if you have a lot of code around the different state but i expose that as an external the drawback is that you may get some overlap between the methods of your internal iorderstate interface and the externally exposed order is a judgement but if i were go with your instinct not to expose the details of your state implementation to code that uses your order class should be readable and

methods are designed to be self and they borrow from the rich tradition of try to explain what you have first portion indicates that this is an objective c method that returns a nsinteger the indicates that this is an where a would indicate that this is a the first value in parenthesis is the return type of the portion is a part of the the message in this case is the runtime takes this method information and sends it to the indicated in pure this would look nsinteger since this is additional information is packed into the message portion is part of the the input here is of type and has a local variable name of portion is the second part of the as you can see message names are split up to help indicate what information you are passing to the if i were to message an object myobject with the variables foo and i would opposed to is the last portion of the the input here is of type and has a local variable name of

might be missing something but i will take a crack at this you have to create the control hierarchy the same as it was on the inital rendering for you ids to match and allow your events to fire it sounds like you need to do some reordering after an event fires so you will need to create the controls need to be able to recreate your controls and the control hierarchy on post you should send enough information to the client so that you can recreate the controls correctly on this can be done by saving information in viewstate if should only recompute the control inforation when it is in your case because of some post back basic flow should be like in you load if you have the viewstate needed to create your call your populate otherwise create them from when a post back the load event will create but they are being reconstructed from viewstate so this should be when the post back event call you populate method to recreate the controls in the new order or with the new depending on what event i am building a control i like to think about how the control will behave if a post back occurs from some other control on the your control should continue to look the same unless affected by that post back and it should be able to be recreated without doing any data but from information it has collected on previous edited my answer and hopefully this is a littler clearer

mvc confusing for are the preferred ways to setup your controller action for form i need to specify an attribute that has the controller action take a or should i use i should use do i setup the form in the i use the html helpers like or simply specify the form tag do you specify the controller and action to be used in a form either the html helpers or with a manual form somebody please show me both a simple view with a form its corresponding controller trying to write a form with a single textbox that i can submit to the action and pass the string from the textbox to is the proper way to handle forms in

my experience with linq to i have concluded for a few reasons that linq is using reflection to set and get field values in entity class i know if i can remember all the but what i can tell i recall linq does not call any property but directly sets and reads all the private field values which can only be done via as far as i names provided by the metadata the attributes on the entity class provide field name information in string form the database column and property name are for you can conclude from this that linq must be using reflection to look up the member to access think it does this to enforce simplicity you can rely on the values in the fields in the entity class directly mirroring the database column and not much overhead in retrieving the object from the database a newly created entity to correspond to values retrieved from the database should not be routed through property one thing i have done to represent enumerated values retrieved from the for is to make some of the properties private and wrap them in a manually coded property in a partial class that reads and writes the linq

my specific i am making use of a discriminator column this means that my jpa implementation creates a table with a special this column contains the class name of the for my table can have subclasses of and these class names would be in the column so that when the entitymanager loads the entity from the it knows which type of class to tried two ways of converting entity types and both feel like dirty a native query to manually do an update on the changing its this works for entities whose property constraints are a new entity of the target do a call to move over the save the new then call a named query which manually replaces the new id with the old id so that all the foreign key constraints are problem with is that when you manually change this jpa know how to this entity to the persistance it expects a with id not a with id it fails here i could probably do an and detach all the but since this is a service it would wipe pending changes for all users of the problem with is that when you delete the all of the properties you have set to will be deleted as this is bad because only trying to swap in a different not delete all the extended object the problems of have made it all but unusable for so given up on trying to get it to the more elegant of the hacks is definitely and i have made some progress in this the key is to first get a reference to the underlying hibernate session using hibernate as your jpa and call the method to remove only that single object from your persistance unfortunitely there is no pure jpa support for here is some sample make sure we save any pending user remove the user instance from the persistence final session session update the final string sqlstring user set where final query query problem here load the user with its new return the manual which throws this detached entity passed to can see that the of which has a onetomany is causing some i know enough about going on behind the scenes to crack this the only thing that works so far is to change dtype as shown in the above then call completely understand the ramifications of clearing the entire persistence and i would have liked to get working on the particular entity being updated to change entity type in	
my the biggest problem with code coverage tools is the risk that somebody will fall victim to the belief that code equals most coverage tools just offer statement coverage as opposed to data path or decision that means that possible to get coverage on a bit of code like i i if without ever testing the termination condition on the for possible to get very high from a test that simply invokes your without bothering to validate the or validating it code coverage levels is certainly an indication of insufficient but coverage levels are an indication of sufficient or correct

myself have used the irepository approach lately that keith you should not be focusing on that pattern there are a few more pieces in the ddd playbook that can be applied for your there is the concept of value objects you can apply in you it would be the the difference between a value object and an entity object is that entities have an vos do the identity really is the sum of not a unique in the book design also a free pdf he explains this very well by stating that an address is really just a point on earth and does not need a separate identity like a that point on earth is the combination of the and it can have latitude and longitude but still those are even vos by definition because a combination of two for combining your entities into a single entity to act do not forget about the services concept in the ddd in your that service would class void do some work for a new is a need for a service when you have two entities that need both need a similar action to coordinate a combination of other in your saving a and creating a blank at the same usualyl require an how would you go about saving the address vo in the you would use an iaddressrepository but since most orms require all objects have an the mark the identity as internal in your so it is not exposed outside of your model this is steven own class make your identity isdbgenerated autosync internal int addressid everything else public string streetnumber public string street public string city

not consider ethics for a consider the you are proposing to do is see section clause 12 of the order of allocation of nonstatic members separated by an is if you have a class with private and a struct with no private the standard does not guarantee that the members will be in the same if your hack it works only by that the compiler writers happened to do it that there is no guarantee that it will work on another a later version of the same or with different class to mention if you have authority to modify the class to provide a simple accessor you probably have authority to object if any implementation detail in the class of the ideas behind public and private is to distinguish what is promised from what is freely the layout may or the member might come to mean something or be removed sutter wrote guru of the column on this as far as the ethics if you really have to do something like and you get out of document it very if your coding standards have some sort of procedure to flag nonstandard use if be very careful to note it in a way it be overlooked when something goes

not entirely clear about what asking maybe you could provide a little more detail about what you mean by the exceptions being too is it that the error messages themselves are not saxparseexception class does have and methods which you can present to the user to get them to fix the thing that you might experiment with is using different implementations every parser will throw an error when it finds invalid but different implementations may have different error messages and exception for this reason be dubious about trying to build a library which inspects the exception chain and tries to build a more coherent error message out of since be coupling your code fairly tightly to the specific details of an implementation if relying on the specific verbiage of error this more maybe you could give an example of the problem

not good with but if what doing is just replacing external urls not part of your with an internal url that will track and redirect the then it should be easy to construct a regexp that will match only external say your domain is then you just need to create a regexp that will only match a hyperlink that contain a url starting with as i pretty bad with but my best stab at you want to track to internal urls as then just replace with the url of your walk through an example scenario just to show what talking say you have the below ipsum dolor sit consectetur adipiscing donec lacus ipsum quisque sagittis sodales mauris dictum blandit consequat the purpose of this the search pattern will only match links that begin regexp can be broken down into 3 the first pass of the the script will link satisfies all 3 components of the so the url is stored in the database and is replaced with the second pass of the the script will link matches 1 and but not so the search will move on to the next link satisfies all 3 components of the so it the url is stored in the database and is replaced with the 3rd pass of the the script will examine the first 2 skip and then find a match with the last link in the	
not got nothing to do with about decomposing a vector initial sequence of into a different just that this basis has a series of very useful orthogonal the vectors and determining the transformation back to the original basis is exceedingly the fourier basis vectors are eigenvectors of the shift circular for the discrete operation a basis after shifting the vector is still the same function a what makes convolutions and the solution of a large class of differential equations very simple in fourier and the entries are roots of unity this gives raise to the one of the most elegant algorithms ever reducing the operations required for a change of basis to n log

not much obviously better than marching through the string a character at a time and making sure the user entered only ones and keep in mind that even though you could write a fast assembly routine if you everything is or you really want to do the user could enter and like to be able to tell them if they screwed up or true that this seems slow compared to the couple cycles it probably takes to add the actual but does it really matter if you get your answer in a nanosecond or a humans can only detect 30 milliseconds of latency it already takes far longer to get input from the user and write output to the screen than it does to parse the string or add the so your algorithm is hardly the bottleneck save your fancy optimizations for things that are actually computationally intensive you should focus on here is making the task less it turns out someone already did that for a look at char char int will let you convert a string in any base to a it checks sample usage for converting a binary number bad try else number is now a long converted from a valid binary base 2 tells to convert binary	
not only way of notifying a thread without any explicit code in the thread itself is to use which will cause an exception in the is usually not very reliable because throwing a exception at some random point in the code is a nightmare to get right in all code beside a single somewhere in the thread any libraries that you could be enough to swallow the most the only correct solution is use a shared flag or a queue that the consumer can use to pass messages to the if you worry about the producer being unresponsive or run it in a separate thread and require it to send heartbeat messages every n if it does not send a kill that determining whether a producer is actually and not just waiting for an external is often very hard to get right as

not sure how this works on other platforms but on the mac there is the following clear distinction in which has little to do with file format causes all subsequent to overwrite the file you just created using so modifies the location of the document that you are working with and stores its current state in that new while leaving the original copy does not have this you export to a specific path only after that a operation will still save to the location of the document as it was before the was even in an application that supports a plethore of file such as which allows you to to various formats of varying an command may still make in fact it makes way more sense than saving a complicated document to seemingly retaining any in the while affecting any subsequent saves to also save to that same the fundamental difference is not in file format or a format but the conceptual difference i described leads to a logical distinction in what qualifies a file format to appear in your and when you might want to relegate it to an

not sure what you are trying to achieve because the code still make much i believe the following should approximate what trying to note that i use heap not necessary and it would leak t return works because you pass a pointer to to the method of you could call the code like fill x2 this code smells because no idiomatic in you would usually write a copy constructor methods do exist but they are very rarely and the above is not late bound neither is your	
not sure what you if you want to know if the application is currently being you can check the if you want to know if the application is compiled in debug then you can do const bool debugmode const bool debugmode you can use void strongly suggest reconsidering that though in my having different release and debug behaviour is an excellent way to introduce bugs to your production	
not sure what you mean by if you mean then you can just construct a from a string and catch the resulting malformedurlexception if not if you mean that actually something you could issue an http head request like geo or you could just retrieve the is particularly handy for retrieving web headers may indicate when the content has as nan suggested if you want to count on that you can just retrieve the page and store or even store a hash of the page see for generating a on a subsequent check for changes you would simply compare the new hash with the the one you stored last is right about start on what os are you

not technically an so maybe missing could someone spell out the tradeoffs of is it really faster to learn and understand jquery syntax than to just learn is more than another to it allows you to express yourself in ways that are more compact and succincter than the corresponding javascript at the same clearer and much more the benefits you get jquery is essentially a dsl for dom manipulation and this specificity is a major source of its utility and to a very large jquery is run even in this is still a surprisingly rare feat for gratifying and relieving to know that you have to waste time debugging obscure problems on ie6 most of the complete as a i prize apis and frameworks that have taken the time to spell out what all the moving pieces are supposed to be nothing is more encouraging than knowing that things are stable enough that writing documentation an attempt to hit a moving target and things are useful enough that attracted enough people to flesh out the documentation the difference between javascript and jquery is analogous to the difference between assembly and programming although both technically both interface to machine and can both do similar the latter is considered far more powerful because of how easy it is to represent things and develop	
not that bad to need to target x86 on x64 you will miss out on the extra x64 benefits and end up running in the 32bit emulation but better than being completely and most apps out there are still the normal reason to need to do this is a dependency on a native only if you leave your targeted from any cpu it will try to load your dll in resulting in a you do want to move away from that dependency so you can use but for one release it kill

nothing new to the data access code from your business but always on the for the to achieve have the following this is my business this is a list of user would fetch orange objects from the data store by calling therefore orangelist has to have a reference to the data access layer so it has the idataprovider will work for but the problem is that we cannot fetch a single orange by itself we always have to go via that or both orange and orangelist would have to descend from some common object that would hold the this a or is my approach way off the mark in the first are in light of the discussion i checked out the repository for my i think it is a good idea to separate still further the repository from the the repository is how i get and save but still know i delegate that to the which could be a number of those listed in the clarify orange does not know how to a pure business object and is that the case my is to support an old which accesses a database but this lets me wrap this up and keep it at from my new terms of assembly to prevent circular references it looks like gonna have a a and a all i got the idea of the repository data access layer from business

notion that would appear useful in your app is the concept of song a song source would essentially be an enumerable item that provides access to this could firstly be an way you have the abstract concept of a piece of code providing lists of the actual player would access any implementation of to get the next song to and play the playing i am afraid i help you if all else fails you could create m3u files from your song sources and start winamp via passing the newly created in this sounds like a neat version you want to code everything you may need a piece of code to read id3 tags from an mp3 file you are playing mp3 you should see this as independent functionality and chances are that there is already something the id3 tagging is not very if i remember well there are defined byte offsets at the head of the mp3 on this you should be able to implement song sources that consider id3 tags in order to decide what song should be part of the there is the that is a whole world on its especially if you would have a skinnable but with a decent wpf book and some proof of concepts you should be on your way to get something

number of a series of a 32 bit unsigned int is 32 binary the string is a series of 5 digits can be stored in many as array elements and so the largest datatype in with complete precision is probably the decimal type just choose your own method of storing digits that allows you to store much bigger for the this will give you a sum of digits of is in 4875 sum of digits of is in 51 sum of digits of is in 2 algorithm and solution in as alluded to a number is nothing more than an array of this can be represented easily in two a an array of characters or others have storing the digits in reverse order is actually it makes the calculations much i tried both of the above i found strings and the character arithmetic irritating easier in the syntax is just plain annoying in first thing to note is that you can do this with one you need to allocate more storage at each as mentioned you can find a power of 2 by doubling the previous power of so you can find by doubling 1 one thousand the doubling can be done in place with the general digit in sum digit digit if sum 10 carry sum carry end digit algorithm is basically the same for using a string or an at the end you just add up the a naive implementation might add the results into a new array or string with each bad really slows it as it can be done in how large should the array well easy mathematically you can convert to where is a simple logarithmic conversion and the number of digits you need is the next higher integer from that power of for you can just required of 2 is a close approximation and you can really optimise this is by using larger a 32 bit signed int can store a number between 2 billion well 9 digits equals a billion so you can use a 32 bit int or as basically a base one billion you can work out how many ints you create that array and all the storage you need to run the entire algorithm 130ish with everything being done in follows fairly rough static void const int limit int ints limit number new for i i string text sum of digits of limit is static void int carry for i i if carry carry static string int i while 0 string ret while ret return

of a homework use a relational database but that probably help first thing you need to figure as others have already is how much data an search fast as long a is since a trivial amount of data this a trivial problem it in an and just going to assume the amount of data is your search requirements appear to require the data sorted city unique identifier of actually too hard to is store in some the array index becomes the unique we deleting or if we do delete cities we leave that array spot wasting some adding is we also need to be able to find most fewest may happen adding changing number and borrowing from relational an index using some form of balanced databases use a but different ones may work for check on in each tree just keep a pointer of the city no reason to make another recommend a tree over a hash for one simple you can do a preorder or reverse order traversal to find the top n a hash do if modifications may not just use another array to the once duplicate cities to to do this depends on how you have to query the and what can the most general is that each profile can be multiple cities and each city can be associated with we want to be able to efficiently query from ask both visits and cities does lifting from databases create another a fairly simple one along the lines btree pointers here or use a pointer for both indices to say bob has visited phoenix and to say bob has visited vegas as add another so have two of them for you have a you can store these either in a tree or go with the since that code is but a hash would be instead of for just like we did for the city visit create an index so the lookup can be done from that side now have a way to look up the 5 cities an on the city visit count and find out who visits by search for each city in the index to get grab only unique and you have your and something seems wrong this seems like an awful lot of code for your instructor to want written in several

of all this is tough thing to so far i come up with a good example but i hope someone here will figure this i hope there is known way to solve these kind of or an obscure my application i do several requests to the very same has dynamic and random content in it such as and quote of the day in theory can be of this application has got 2 call them and for example sometimes response would return a sometimes it would be application knows 3 samples of case and 3 samples of but these are also include random content such as as when my application gets a new response how can i understand if this response is an example of or the first sample of true case line by line and generate an integer array from the value of the same thing for second true the same thing for third true the differences between these stored true cases and create a new array with i know which lines are dynamic as now i create a new final true case array which stores only static lines to a final true case when i got a new i create a similar array then compare it with previously stored final true case and if does match filtered a true case if other lines are massively changed is a tolerance then and weaknesses of this algorithm is pretty although got some good results in some but it work as expected all the current class works like analyser as new will return true if the unknownhtml is similar to true otherwise the title make much i find a good way to describe to understand if the static part of the text has been algorithm

of the autotools are not an opaque build system but a loosely coupled as tinkertim already pointed let me just add some thoughts on autoconf and is the configuration system that creates the configure script based on feature checks that are supposed to work on all kinds of a lot of system knowledge has gone into its macro database during the 15 years of its on the one i think the latter is the main reason autotools have not been replaced by something else on the other autoconf used to be far more important when the target platforms were more heterogeneous and and a large variety of different processor architecture had to be i really see its point if you only want to support recent linux distributions and is an abstraction layer for gnu make and acts as a makefile generator from simpler a number of projects eventually got rid of the automake abstraction and reverted to writing makefiles manually because you lose control over your makefiles and you might not need all the canned build targets that obfuscate your to the i strongly suggest an alternative to autotools based on your most notable achievement is replacing autotools in probably the closest you can get if you want to have functionality without m4 it brings windows support to the table and has proven to be applicable in large my beef with cmake is that it is still a least on with all its immanent problems makefile timestamp implicit dependency is a make replacement written in it uses python scripts as build control files allowing very sophisticated its configuration system is not on par with scons is often used for development when adaptation to specific requirements is more important than following you really want to stick with i strongly suggest to read make considered and write your own gnu makefile configured through

of the optimizations you listed are practically irrelevant these days for c programmers the compiler is better at performing things like loop loop loop and strength versus for they generate identical machine so which one you use is a matter of in objects can overload those and postincrement in which case usually preferable to use a because a postincrement necessitates an extra object for using shifts instead of multiplications by powers of the compiler already does that for depending on the it can do even more clever such as turning a multiplication by 5 into a single instruction on with divisions and moduli by powers of you might need to pay a little more attention to get the optimal suppose you y and are signed the compiler turn that into a right shift because it will yield an erroneous result for negative so emits a right shift and some bit twiddling instructions to make sure the result is correct for both positive and negative if you know and are always then you should help the compiler out and make them unsigned integers the compiler can optimize it into a single right shift modulus operator works similarly if modding by a power of with signed integers the compiler has to emit an instruction plus a little more bit twiddling to make the result correct for positive and negative but it can emit a single instruction if dealing with unsigned

of the physical write to disk is the bottle neck by some orders of and it is in most scenarios rather parallelizing writes you have good chances to performance by incurring sequential reads and writes will largely outperform interleaving n most parallelization and mainly work by reducing the seeks that are naturally required when different clients concurrently request data from different sections of the if you can avoid these seeks in the first you are better some scenarios raid jbod or when different streams of data arrive rather slowly the right scheduling can improve your but that requires intimate knowledge of the hardware at and other processes not spoiling your you can leave that as a decision to the end user give an option to turn it and provide performance measures to guide might even prove me wrong

of the things working on right now has some similarities to a for purposes of going to explain my problem using an example drawn from a hypothetical call it the in you have a number of objects which periodically and randomly encounter as they a given may have or more on a that encounters for we might have four kinds of and three kinds of gravitywell blackhole speed power no effect invulnerable death effects of speed death shield phenomena on death power no effect may interact with each for a that is in both a and a may derive some kind of synergy between the generated and in such the synergistic effect is itself an for there might be a that results from this no information other than the set of acting on a is needed to resolve what the final result should may begin to see a problem emerging as a naive first every will have to know how to handle every or every will have to know about every this is obviously so we would like to move these responsibilities clearly at least one external class perhaps a or of some the best way to do the ideal solution will probably have these as easy to add a new as it is to add a new that produce no effect are the default and require additional code to convention over how interact with each other and is capable of managing these interactions to decide what the final result will already decided what my approach will i but interested to hear what the consensus where would you what avenues would you thanks for your what i wound up my main observation was that the number of different seems to be small relative to the number of possible that although there are many possible of the number of of of those interactions is a smaller can see for although there are 12 interaction combinations in the there are only five of modifications to modifications to modifications to introduced a third the to determine the result of it contains a dictionary that maps pairs to are basically a delegate that performs the effect and some each is handed an corresponding to the experiencing when the result of computing the interaction is then use the to determine the actual result of the on by adding modifiers to their existing attributes and like this never need to know about complexity of the relationship is abstracted into the details of how to resolve multiple and possibly complex effects is abstracted away by the ships only have to apply the effects as enables additional useful for the in which a ship processes effects could be differentiated by making an the default might be to process all a might ignore minor effects by having a different the best way to resolve a combinatorial explosion of

of this question have been asked namely and solutions seem to boil down to two reflection to figure out calling the case of console a call to console in a and see if it fails own recommendation is to have your library export an the interface has a function or property that return the type of the the calling object has a class that implements the interface and return what type it because complexity is a concern you can control that somewhat by what you place in the a application register itself with the library then you can try throwing an error or trying some scheme of automatic using an interface and throwing an error you are making it explicit to the programmer using the library what exactly you the interaction between the two is defined by the addition the interaction is more flexible than a automatic scheme because as the get to choose how my calling binary interacts with your library rather than some mysterious set of

on published by google engineers henry shumeet and yushi it seems the most important implication of your question about recognizing colors in images relates to algorithm for pictures that can detect without any text around paper begins by describing by describing the which are typically based on normalizing color brightness and then using a or using a histogram built up using the rgb values in pixels color is a 8bit integer value from representing how much of that color is included in the methods have also been introduced that rely on properties such as incorrectly called which is the density of luminous intensity to the naked eye from a given google paper mentions that they will need to process roughly images with their algorithm so it needs to be as efficient as to achieve they perform the majority of their calculations on an roi of which is a rectangle centered in the image and inset by of the image dimensions on all once determined the they have many different algorithms that are then applied to the image including color constancy and which as a whole find in the coloring and most importantly the color shades with the highest frequency in the statistical use other features such as entropy and to order to extract lines from the they use the opencv implementation of the probabilistic hough transform et computed on the edges of the skin color connected which allows to find straight which are probably not body parts and additionally allows them to better determine which colors are most important in an which is a key factor in their image color more on the technicalities of this topic including the math equations and read the google paper linked to in the beginning and look at the research section of their web interesting question and

options come to malloc the memory in the free it in the we tend to avoid malloc use in anything that approaches a real time if you have access to and there are no concerns or memory fragmentation issues your heap is large then this is a fairly easy the driver just sends the allocated pointer to the app thread via a message queue and the app the memory when watch out for memory ring or circular the driver completely manages a fixed size ring buffer and simply sends a message to the application when a buffer is see here for some then the application marks the data again via a driver which helps hide the ring buffer details from the app we use this approach for one of our drivers that has a very similiar set of requirements as you in this you need to be concerned with determining the size for the ring overflow handling in the

personal ideal is to write enough commentary so that reading just the comments explains how and why a function is intended to be how it should usually come out from well chosen variable names and clear way to achieve at least on the comment is to use a tool such as from the start coding each new function by writing the comment describing what it is for and how it should be doxygen configured have document generation included as a build and read the resulting only comment template that might be helpful would be one that sketches in the barest beginning of the doxygen comment but even that might be too you want the generated documentation to explain what is important without cluttering it with worthless placeholder text that will never get

personally prefer things to be and to make my life easier i consider making my life easier may not be what you consider making your life so do with this advice what you you have something like new new you have an inconsistency parameters are the other is created on the to be consistent you would pass things as pass things created on the one of those will work first are also practical aspects to it as making a variable makes debugging are some are still lines in the you want to display the next line for debugging you now need to change it are still lines in the line would be easier to have made the variable up it is safer because you are less likely to accidentally call twice forgetting to take it out of the foo can also view the value of in a debugger without having to go into the one that can happen is in java you get a nullpointerexception on this or the thing that was no nullpointexception here you know b was nullpointexception here you know c was null can view d in the debugger without having to go into debuggers will let you highlight and see what it but that is dangerous if has side effects as the debugger will wind up calling each time you get the value via the way i code for this does make it more verbose this answer but it also makes my life easier if things are not working as expected i spend far less time wondering what went wrong and i am also able to fix bugs much faster than before i adopted this way of doing me the most important thing when programming is to be if you are consistent then the code is much easier to get through because you are not constantly having to figure out what is going and your eyes get drawn to any in the

prefer the first method because you can cast the derived class pointer to the parent class without any the other way c standard guarantees that the address of a struct is the address of the first so in the second case it is safe to cast a pointer to derived to as the first member of derived is the parent and a the struct as a member as the same layout as the same struct when not a so casting a pointer to a derived to parent will always same is not true for the second two structs with some members defined as the same type may have different padding between those would be reasonable for a 64 bit bigendian compiler to a a b that is a whole multiple of 8 and b is 64 bit but b a b c that is a whole multiple of but b is only 32 bit aligned so that it waste

problem i see with the method is the location where drawing the my understanding is that each sprite in your game is a separate the graphics object being passed in the paintcomponent method different for each you can imagine a graphics object as a painting if you only had 1 graphics object for the entire and this graphics object represented the entire game then your logic would be correct and everything should each sprite here has its own graphics presumably with height and width relevant to the in this your paintcomponent method would probably just look void if always at because with your moving the and graphics around the game the coordinates you pass to are relative to the graphics you always want to start painting in the hand of the getting just a gray square because trying to draw the image way out of bounds of the graphics the long i think this approach is going to work because not that easy to move jpanels around inside of their parent containers using absolute not really scalable either because jpanels are pretty heavyweight and take a lot of resources to create and are probably better of having a single jpanel that represents the entire game each sprite be a subclass of so you have a paintcomponent you could do something like class gamearea extends private final sprites to public void sprite class sprite no need to extend your other code looks ok public void

program does file loading and in the background while the screen is meant to be updated the idea is to have async loading of files the program will soon need so that they are ready to be used when the main thread needs the seem to happen in parallel with the main the main thread pauses during the loading and will often wait for all loads be up to 8 at to finish before the next iteration of the main main using so using for creating the worker thread keeps the list from being updated by the main uses waitforsingleobject is a list added to from the main while loadobj thread in a class that the main thread uses to the thread for loading a i used the commented code to see if main thread was ever but the print never so it looks like it never was waiting on the more notes based on function in the worker thread loads via win32 readfile function does this cause the main thread to reduced the worker thread priority to either and and that helps a but when i move the mouse around to see how slowly it moves while the worker thread is the mouse a bit lowering the it was much am running on a core 2 so i expect to see any mouse lag at code seem to be an issue since the never printed in my test code bumped the sleep up to but even 1000ms seem to help as far as the mouse lag being loaded is tiny 20k images they are they are small size since this is just test one single color in the so real data will be much is my thread not parallelized with the main

pure using an int as your primary key is better simply due to the support for comparison of ints at the machine code strings are compared using algorithms implemented at the database unless your strings are very an integer key will take up less space on the page as well based on the other answer now on the not sure if understood your question are you asking whether it is better to use an integer as your key compared to a string either could be or are you asking whether your type should match your database assuming the would be very surprised if it is the latter whose answer i would think is lieven has now clarified his request to say that he in asking whether an int or an nchar field would be better as an index so my original take on this question was add to my it is almost always better to have an int as your the exception is when there is a key that can be captured as a short character string in an accounting system where entries are char the reasons are integers are represented as a native machine type or and manipulated via operations whereas strings are not but must be compared using a for when traversing the pk index some variant of a to locate a the comparison operation at each node is a single is this a huge probably not unless you are working with a truly massive database or transaction if you have a natural character key by all use if your is the first five letters of the last name plus the first initial plus a number to make it then obviously be far better off with an int integers simply take up less room than almost any char key assuming the use of and it just the room in the main table remember that the index fields are represented in the index as is this a big not unless you working with a massive our choice of keys often has effects for if you use the primary key on one table as the foreign key on both of the above effects are magnified when you are inserting or updating records in the table using the foreign use the key that is most if you have a choice between int and char and both are essentially go with the int over the	
purpose does searializing the data in json is it purely for if then brian is those variables should have getter the purpose of serialization is to transport the data to a javascript app where it can be manipulated and then returned to the originating then perhaps you would be best served by creating a related class that serves the purpose of serialization while still maintaining strong in java you could define an inner an inner class instance has direct access to all fields of the enclosing class instance without the need of getter or you could group with a package using the correct access modifiers to permit access by the but not by any other you could use or hijack the tostring shine it all and create a tojson

put it have the same url display the applicable parts of the resource based on the authenticated roles are already decided upon when makes no sense to require duplicating the data in the imagine you have a complex user permission would you then have the user duplicate their whole acl in the this way the user even have to be aware of the views are fundamentally different share any fields at all or fields have different then create two resources but this likely the case there actually are multiple views of the same resource between which the can then put the view in the query parameter since it pertain to the resource but actually is the of the but keep in mind that the query parameter here is not in your which imo is an important following this three you can cache the resource and then strip the relevant data from it based on the current user and the view query

python the interface of an iterable is a subset of the this has the advantage that in many cases they can be treated in the same there is an important semantic difference between the since for an iterable returns a new iterator object and not just how can i test that an iterable is really an iterable and not an conceptually i understand iterables to be while an iterator only manages the iteration keeps track of the but is not a collection difference is for example important when one wants to loop multiple if an iterator is given then the second loop will not work since the iterator was already used up and directly raises is tempting to test for a but this seems dangerous and somehow should i just check that the second loop was there any way to do such a test in a more pythonic i know that this sound like a classic case of lbyl against so maybe i should just give or am i missing says in his answer below that this is primarily a problem of wanting to do multiple passes over the and that one should not do this in the first in my case the data is very large and depending on the situation has to be passed over multiple times for data processing is absolutely no way around iterable is also provided by the and for situations where a single pass is enough it will work with an iterator created by a generator for but it would be nice to safeguard against the case were a user provides only an iterator when multiple passes are this is a very nice example for base the methods in an iterator and an iterable have the same name but are sematically so is but provides a clean to tell the difference between an iterator and an

question as amended actually has less to do with threading and more to do with how to stop long running personally i always use apm for lengthy stream and communications activities such as large file each callback runs on an io completion pool thread and completes processing a modest chunk and scheduling the next pending operations can be cancelled simply by calling on the socket this is a great deal cheaper and more efficient than diy thread already is bad karma and should be material below was written prior to exclusion of the looping case from the long running processes loop they should include an exit flag in their loop condition so that you can signal them to of service a method on some other foreach in more if you ought to use volatiles but since only the control logic ever sets the flag it technically a race condition exists but that just means you might go round one more

question is have the installed files benefits of msi repair is that if something gets mucked a virus infects your or some silly user deletes the wrong entries then the windows isntaller resiliency check kicks in and repairs all your are a number situations where the windows installer resiliency check will kick suggest changing the behaviour of your application so that you update installed alternatively if you want to conform to and not update your installed files then probably need to use an alternate installer not writing changes to stuff in program files are how does your application handle running under a limited user on a terminal on none of these scenarios will permit writing to the program files folder any protected solution to prevent this behavior from happening would default configuration files to these on first run to update the this prevents configuration being during msi try not setting the zip as a in the particular i think windows installer only checks for that key files i think probably going to run into the limitations of vs2005 setup projects pretty quickly and so it might be worth checking out if got the also one thing that find is that windows installer setup projects are almost always having hundreds or thousands of components seems to be the nature of the

quickly realized that doing this will create two variables inside the body class called x and two other variables in body called how is this even and why on earth does java even allow you are not creating two variables with the same obviously a compiler should not and would not allow you doing is shadowing the existing variables defined as and meaning that and are essentially overlapping the names for and making the latter two variable completely inaccessible from the body class to java language specification definition of shadowing is generally perceiving as a bad practice and a cause of and if you turn up the javac compiler the compiler will dutifully warn you about

realize you meant for the iphone environment in that case i would use the db just for the simplicity of having all content in one you wont have to worry about scalability because its not like your iphone is going to be used as a server or dont have any links to back this but i do recall reading in several studies that the is 1 mb for blob but this can moved up to 10 mb with a fast enough disk totally depends on the given your efficiency any data smaller than that would better be served by the anything just index in the db and leave in a file

realloc is likely failing because not reserving a byte for the trailing nul character in strings adding a to your realloc fix that the specific error getting is likely because one of your strings is length and simply gives you that error on your or because writing the trailing in unallocated memory and overwriting something else causing rearranging pointers or using is quicker and stops you wasting

really a question to specific to you are going to use pointers in the predominant reason is that you have an interop scenario where it is going to be easier to use pointers in unsafe code instead of intptr second most popular reason is because you might actually have a performance gain in processing large amounts of data in unsafe code than in managed image processing algorithms are a good example of	
really all across the on one end of the worked in one place where the code was recently rewritten in recently being 10 years everyone was highly skeptical of this farther down the find c programmers who happen to have compilers with features dabble in the but other than they are practically writing in down the line i think find those who just groked inheritance and these are the kind of guys and gals that would swoon over an mfc or wxwidgets thinking it was the go a little farther and find the folks who just read they are all about figuring out how to use stl got a basic notion of templates that equates mostly to the way stl uses got the modern template metaprogramming many of us these days use their work in the form of boost and all its few actually dork around with template probably a good have seen perfectly good code written at each cool thing i always liked about is that at each level of added the cost could be conceptualized in terms of this new abstraction might be implemented in so i can conceptualize that inheritance and polymorphism is adding the cost of a function pointer since i have seen this and written this in i know what in i also have a sense of how templates work in part because of how the preprocessor works in this applies to most features in the and c easy to map concepts to how they are implemented in i can easily visualize how the underlying architecture runs my

really need to classify type of thread javas vector is safe to be used from multiple threads because it uses synchronization on the state will not be usefulness is limited from multiple threads without additional for consider the simple act of reading an element from a vector 0 object first method will not corrupt the state of the but it also is not there is nothing stopping another thread from mutating the vector in between the if statement an the this code can and eventually fail because of a race type of synchronization is only useful in a handfull of scenarios and it is certainly not you pay a noticable price for synchronization even if you use multiple chose not to pay this price by default for a scenario of only limited instead it chose to implement a lock free authors are responsible for adding any closer to model of only for what you recently wrote a couple of articles on the dangers of using collections with only internal synchronization such as are thread safe collections so more usable api for a mutable thread safe vector thread

really new and rewarding would be a look into the smalltalk web frameworks like and pure object married with the for really complex web yet maintainable for plus is that you will mostly program just in smalltalk and not in so many languages as you do this is easier but from time to time you still need to know basic web technologies like html and specially javascript is mostly hidden until you want to do something more

recently applied for a junior programmer position and went through the initial phone which i felt pretty good my current position is at a company that uses exclusively development for i have worked with in college and some on my own after college and that is what i want to use for my career in the have the first programming book for by jesse liberty from a college i remember this book being really helpful to me in college and i want to spend another dollars on a my question is how is the first section of that 1 through and even some of the later sections of the has the language changed so much that it would be better to not read this book and use some other online i have some new books that should take care of the stuff that has changed for web but i mainly want to get refreshed on the to is a great website i just refreshed a few minutes later and had several great responses from other been doing primarily support at my current position rather than new development so not extremely familiar with all the new majority of time is spent legacy apps with this is why applying for a junior level posision and would be willing to take a slight paycut just to be able to do new development with guidance from a good lead i think that would be a lot better for my future career

recently been reading louis book on sql server database design and found it quite picked up on alot of concepts that i previously know alot primarily i picked up on a way to set up database relationships that i tried you use a surrogate key as the tables pk auto incremented id and then set up one or more alternate keys consisting of one or more unique theese alternate kays would then be the values used for relationships the if that makes more sense for the given remodelled an old database that was suffering from some data inconsitencies due to poor design to implement to new way of a database level it works tha relationships function the way supposed to and the constraints are enforced in a reliable cannot get it to work properly in either the entity framework or in linq to sql i read that in v1 of it just flat out support this kind of relationship so i moved to linq to sql to see if things would work out they seemingly as i got all the relationships automatically mapped out when i imported the classes from my the problem is that i save data to the database because of invalidcastoperation exceptions as soon as i try to save i have a couple of this a limitation in linq to is there a way to work preferebly without for update and delete safety is something i to this way of designing hope someone can shed some light on as getting quite frustrated about i really find any good material on the subject online so hopefully someone here has an answer or can point me in the right i ended up doing was this i went back to using the entity framework in conjunction with a redesign of the database i remodeled the relationships to rely on primary keys rather than alternate in most where that was not an option i made some modifications to the ef i implemented the relationship that relied on the at which time ef to get around that i had to delete the foreign key property on the many side of the relationship at which point ef accepts the to sql and relationship

recently started work on a project which involves creating a reporting interface for a fairly old software responsible for managing some access control hardware like electronic door locks for have chosen cakephp for the task and all it involves is querying the database for the log records and displaying them on the the software is written in and uses msde version of microsoft sql server or and i was able to configure cakephp so that it successfully connects to the problem is that the developer of this software has chosen to store the logs in the database by creating a separate table for each so it looks like am not really familiar with msde but i still doubt that it is an acceptable practice to design and maintain a database like i do not know how the desktop software manages to parse query all the information when all in this format but my cakephp application is having some really hard time chewing this want to stick with mvc for the web application but i know how to implement the dooreventmodel in cakephp so that it gets the information from all the partitioned tried implementing some hacks like all select from all select from this sort of works but when i want to perform where restriction on the whole query or any other sql operator it one of the requests was that the application does not add or create any additional databases or tables and only uses the existing ones to display the reports so creating one huge table that includes all of the clustered ones is not really an just hope that someone will come up with an sqlserver function that will merge all tables into one for me every time i perform a query but i know this is a bit so open to all suggestions please remember that the solution must work with cakephp and as a single model in the data from multiple clustered tables as one

reputation system is without real life if anonymous people can be invited then it can always be with sufficient effort and false aim should be to increase the cost of such gaming above the potential which will depend on what your system gets used main cost you can use to inhibit power gains is forcing users to contribute positively reviewed contributions before you increase their you do and how you make it difficult for them to leverage existing identities to falsely rate as positive the contributions of new identities they are trying to give power is the nuts and bolts of the and should make use of an existing user base to spot and penalise spurious false can make use of game theory by rewarding people for being in the so if a accuses b of it is highlighted and lots of people get to vote on those who cast their mojo on the side of the vote that ends up get it back and increase in reputation for reliability is worth having more than one type of while those in the lose a triangle number of mojo the first 2 the 3 the 6 the 10 the and so

requirement is not a its reality which helps you to create most usable and matured to adopt any agile methods which encourages you to do design and change it if after certain time in you might feel that your design should be at that you can plan subsequently to change not avoid changes but embrace you avoid change for time being by writing work the cost of change will increase afterward and it will be difficult to change later then based designs are the most change based on the vision of the you create a core and most of the features are developed as plug in to the

response to your edit about information a valid concern for the general but logging is not the general in you should not be relying on logging output from one part of your program to affect the execution of another that would indeed tightly couple the consumer to the implementation of the should be considered incidental to your main your systems should not know or care about the presence or contents of such log files the exception possibly of monitoring that being the the notion of decoupling of the logs from their production is since you using the logs to do anything coupling is not an

reviews the my team a code review is sent to the entire dev team working in that feature area only about 6 of us right previously it has been as high as it is then up to the recipients to decide if they should review the code or his only works because our whole team is committed to the process and voluntarily take on code reviews as they see it advisable to have only one developer reviewing a piece of would say at least 2 pairs of eyes need to review but our rule is that only one other person review granularity of code should kick off a exceptions are trivial changes just check those and emergency to fix check in then review software tools are available to help with code tell you about the ones we use because they are proprietary and internal use you need a good version control from then on fairly straightforward you basically send the code around up in an email if you have and other developers can the code against the checked in depending on your system there may be tools to help you do this more is what we do for basic code there are lots of other you can make it more have meetings with minutes and actions i recommend you read up on code reviews in code mcconnell is always worth reading and he knows his

right way to do this with arrays is to do it with a for a complicated set of arrays play nice with arrays have a different covariance model than generic objects which ultimately causes the problems you are running for with but not with generic you can legally do myarray new you cannot do mycollection new you want more you can see the in java page from the excellent simonn you can also just use your arrays as they and use to silence the this will but without the type safety that generics can provide if performance that you are worried just use an so you are just using a thin wrapper around an but with all of the type safety guarantees provided by	
right when you say you have to consider how often these functions are if is accessed all the it be as that would be slower than if the other functions are accessed then recalculating every time would be a waste as middle ground would be having something that calculates on demand if a flag is set to and then sets the flag to calls to etc would set the flag to like cachedcount int count boolean int if return count return void that this would really only provide a benefit if you access several times in a row without accessing etc in and that accesses to etc interleaved with calls to the benefit of this is lost if the requests are the biggest benefit comes from sequences rather than

running into a situation where i need the atomic sum of two values in the code i inherited goes like a b individual reads of a and b are and all writes elsewhere in the code to these two memory locations are also lockless however the problem is that the values of the two locations can and do change between the two how do i make this operation i know all about but it tends to only involve making operations atomic and not quite what i want to do there a way to do or is the best option to refactor the code so that i only need to check one i mention that i wanted to do this locklessly in the first but some people picked up on it after my second i know no one believes people when they say things like but i use locks have to emulate a mutex with atomics and be more work than refactoring the code to keep track of one value instead of now my method of investigation involves taking advantage of the fact that the values are consecutive and grabbing them atomically with a 64 bit which assured are atomic on my target if anyone has new please there a way i can make two reads

s new enough least in some that it may be a little early to say exactly the been around for a fair long although we make up a cool name for any the short answer is the idea of doing a design is to model the domain very what looking at is a domain which is to say an model that describes the problem domain in the problem the idea is that a domain since it models the is relatively insensitive to and also tends to localize if for example your idea of what an employee is perhaps by adding a mailing address as well as a physical then those changes would be relatively you have that you have what i maintain are architectural decisions still to be for you have the unimplemented persistence which might indeed be simply construction of it could also be a hibernate or use python or even be something wild like a google appengine distributed table thing those decisions are made and with other than the domain modeling experimented with to some good result is doing the domain model in python and then building a simulator with it instead of implementing the final that makes for something the customer can experiment and also potentially allows you to make quantitative estimates about the things the final implementation must

say the correct answer depends on what you actually want and as what will be worthwhile in the long run depends on what need in the long if your goal is to get applications deployed asap then the is surely the way to the value of a and system that exactly what you want be the other hand if you have time to learn a variety of new things which may apply in other domains and want to have the widest scope for customisation then something like turbogears is turbogears gives you maximum flexibility but you have to spend a lot of time reading external docs for things like and genshi to get anything useful done with the tg2 docs are deliberately less detailed than the tg1 docs in some cases because considered that the external docs are better than they used to whether this sort of thing is an obstacle or an investment depends on your own

second answer about using an they are very efficient and simple to implement even in software and are guaranteed not to repeat in uses for an lfsr with an are some drawbacks by observing a small number of outputs from the one can reconstruct the lfsr and predict all values it will making them not usable for cryptography and anywhere were a good rng is the second problem is that either the all zero word or the all one terms of word is invalid depending on the lfsr the third issue which is relevant to your question is that the maximum number generated by the lfsr is always a power of 2 1 power of 2 first drawback might not be an issue depending on your from the example you it seems that you are not expecting zero to be among the the second issue does not seem relevant to your maximum value thus problem can solved by reusing the lfsr until you get a number within your an you want to have numbers between 1 and 10 in your you would use a lfsr which has a range a pseudo code as to how to get number in the range x should embed the previous code in your so that the caller care about that this would slow down your rng if you use a large and the maximum number you want is not a power of 2	
second most that marc gravell wrote specifically remoting and internal serialization are but are very easy to break and often do not scale well to a public network not that familiar with but i guess it needs a well known registry service which is often problematic when going out of the clean lab a standard or even rpc is harder but safer in the long you do not have problems with code revisions they are easier to scaling is fully controlled by your own and its easy to develop components using various are many many many tools that help you easily build rpc mechanisms over but i really like to use plain old http get a simple http embedded server running inside your server process and your client just needs to have an http client to send if you develop your own simple restful call semantics of using some bloated message format like soap or then there is really almost nothing to do

secure hash algorithm algorithm takes a message of less than 264 bits in length and produces a message the algorithm is slightly slower than but the larger message digest makes it more secure against collision and inversion the algorithm specified in the secure hash standard fips was developed by is a revision to sha that was published in the revision corrected an unpublished flaw in its design is very similar to the md4 family of hash functions developed by is also described in the ansi is an algorithm for it is the first algorithm known to be suitable for signing as well as and one of the first great advances in public key rsa is widely used in electronic commerce and is believed to be secure given sufficiently long keys and the use of most notable difference is that sha is an encryption algorithm whereas rsa is both an encryption as well as signing it was announced that it is possible to find a collision in in this research result is due to professor xiaoyun wang of tsinghua university in together with professors andrew yao and frances it extends the work of and which demonstrated that a collision could be found in what that means is that it is easier for a collision to occur in sha than in rsa but no two similar keys have ever been found that

see the look at that top line in its script an html parser comes along and sees the opening inside normal parsing is disabled sgml the element has cdata to find where the script block the html parser looks for the matching first one it finds is the one inside the string an html parser know that inside a string because html parsers know anything about javascript they only know about so what you are actually saying an unclosed string literal and an unfinished function these result in javascript errors and the desired script tag is never common attempt to solve the problem is still technically wrong this is because in the character sequence that ends a cdata element is not actually but just sequence that is still present in the line browsers generally are more forgiving and in practice will allow the best solution is to escape the there are a few but the simplest is to use javascript string literal escapes above escapes all and which not only stops the sequence appearing in the but also allows it to be inserted into an xhtml script block without causing no such thing as a cdata so these characters would have the same meaning as if included in normal and a string inside a script block would actually create a nested script possible to allow in an xhtml script block by using a but a bit ugly and usually better to avoid using those characters in inline	
see the problem in my copy of safari 4 though not exactly sure what issue you would be having since the sidebar on the right is empty and so not sure how i could tell if its being perhaps you should clarify about the exact problem that order to debug the and either solve it yourself or ask a more specific you should try to strip the problem down to the minimal example necessary to see the remove all of the content and structure that is not relevant to the and ensure the problem still remove all of the css that is not relevant to the and ensure that the problem still then you should have a simple with no more than about 10 lines each of html and if you strip it down far you may find your problem in the process removing one of the lines of css makes your problem go then found the and if not the have something that someone else will be able to give you better advice on without having to wade through all of the extraneous you are still having trouble figuring out going you should try the web inspector in in safari 4 you can go to the and choose develop menu in menu i recall when exactly this preference was but in earlier versions of you should be able to follow to enable the once you have done you should be able to right click if you have a right mouse and choose to bring up the web in more recent versions of you should also be able to choose web from the develop this will show you a lot of information on your css and how the metrics on the elements which should help you debug the

seems that when you use you can override the default setting which is that whitespace is so i guess what happens in this case and why you get any in the second case added so the compiler thinks that you want to specify the scope it seems a bit weird so it may be a sure brian from the team will answer this doubt soon i think the compiler treats your second example just as an easier to compile ar new rnd new can force it to treat it as you wanted if you add parentheses and write something like ar new rnd new you can use parentheses to specify scopes in any place of the for example you can a a a printfn example prints and then of this seem to be very but it is useful when using the keyword that behaves like but works for objects and ensures that the object is disposed when it leaves the scope is just like in some new file new let txt printfn is now completely forgot to mention the important bit the first way of writing the code seems more natural to me it fully uses the benefits of syntax that so i would prefer it

seems to be a reasonable the reason you want to use too many static is that you end up moving away from object oriented programming and more into the realm of structured your case where you are simply transforming a to say all doing is transforming text to go from a static method would make if invoking these static methods on an object frequently and it tends to be unique for many calls the way you use it depends on the or it is part of the inherent behavior of the it would be wise to make it part of the object and maintaining a state of one way to do this would be to implement it as an method return transformed string method return transformed string object implements interface mystring implementations of the interface would yield the necessary and it is reusable across the board since it an interface you can make it specific to the method method one good example of great use of static methods are html helper methods in mvc or they create html elements that tied to the behavior of an and are therefore changed functional programming to structured programming some reason i got props to torsten for pointing that

short michael working effectively with legacy longer biggest challenge when maintaining such an application is doing it without breaking this means you need to understand the behaviour of the and the easiest way to do this is to get tests around as this can be daunting at but it is not it requires discipline and have to start with unit usually easier to get an automation such as nunitforms or to drive the application as a black box build up a suite of tests around the area you need to change to give you enough confidence to change it without breaking then go in and start refactoring towards unit anything like the application working it mainly unused code a public static method calls and replacing them with interfaces injection is a key technique duplicated code into file network and user interface code behind adapters can be very thin wrappers at just enough so that you can replace them with stubs when for opportunities to extract behaviour into small it will be easier to rewrite sections of the code rather than refactor but that requires an understanding of the either through testing or by referring to a spec one from any practical if part of a team working on this make sure you are it will make the work more enjoyable and ensure that changes you make today undone tomorrow by someone who understand what you were working could write all day on this but mr feathers is much better at and good

side the word is usually used to describe the parts of the string that are delimiter is used to describe the thing that separates the so to make your code more clear you should rename token to delimiter and rename dest to in your function and are several differences between your function and your function does is simply remove the token only call your function once to process all parts of the with strtok you call it multiple times for each part of the string times with null as the first also destroys the source whereas your code uses its own buffer think better to use your own buffer as you stores the position of the next token after each call where the first parameter is this position is then used for subsequent this is not thread safe though and your function would be thread can use multiple different whereas your code uses just being i will give suggestions for how to make a better not a function that is closer to to improve your function emulate think it would be better to make the following your function simply return the out of your loop when you have or a pointer to the first character of your source string that contains the next this pointer can be used for subsequent

so many c this is very common as you are trying to disguise that an object is a you are trying to imply that this is the object that all your functions manipulate know it is a pointer underneath but it represents the object you are db if db is not a pointer things could be mydb is probably a pointer at some this is no longer because we can pass things around by reference and the methods are incorporated into the class this time we can call be or let the destructor handle

so the essential problem is that you need to do not integer as others have pointed i think fixing this particular code is sort of besides the why bother with it in the first using essentially the same class of algorithm is you want a fast consider an if you want a you have out of the box much consider the numerical recipes algorithm fairly combined which you could implement in java as class highqualityrandom extends random private lock l new private long private long v private long w public public u seed v w public long try u u 2862933555777941757l v v v v v v w 4294957665l long x u x x x x return finally protected int return is copied from some code where i needed it to be you could get rid of the lock in or just use regular you absolutely insist on using at least wrap it in a random and let take care of converting ints to doubles after what extensible libraries in an language are

so when i split the string using first two parts there is a in the can then go in and fill up an array with the remaining the separated i would take the value before the and do a for loop from there to the after the separated i do almost the same except instead of an increment on the for loop i do an parse out the values before and after the or the characters i can just split again and know which indeces in the array correspond to will update this tomorrow with my final henk holterman wants to update his solution with what i said above of parsing out the other i will upvote on my home for some reason they block openid i get why they let me accept the solution even as a i should be able to if i provide my proper email address

so you really should seek qualified legal however is certainly going against the spirit of the license win you any friends in kernel you could consider a different one approach is to fully module and put all your company in a this is an approach i took when the company i worked keen on exposing the details of our fpga to the all and register settings where decided in user space and side of the driver just loaded values in on with you can manage any real time issues you may have and have clean separation between your closed driver and the this is easier with newer kernels with support for user although i think they support dma properly yet had a user space dma kernel module to support dma directly chipset and user i would really recommend you consider what it is to closed drivers may be ok for embedded you have tight control over the kernel version and the if this driver is being considered for anything more generic hardware people will plug into their own then drivers will only prove to be a source of constant pain	
socket you create a listening socket and then for each client that you get a normal stream socket that you can use to handle the the os manages the queue of incoming connections behind the processes cannot bind to the same port at the same time by wondering if a way any especially to launch multiple instances of a such that they all bind to the and so they effectively share the each process instance could then be single it would just block when accepting a new when a client one of the idle process instances would accept that would allow each process to have a very sharing nothing unless through explicit shared and the user would be able to adjust the processing bandwidth by starting more such a feature for those asking not use obviously threads are an but with multiple threads in a single all objects are shareable and great care has to be taken to ensure that objects are either not or are only visible to one thread at a or are absolutely and most popular languages and runtimes lack support for managing this starting a handful of identical worker you would get a concurrent system in which the is no making it much easier to build a correct and scalable there a way for multiple processes to share a listening

solution has its use think the first solution is good if trying to define a relationship as a simple especially if you need to use the key as a lookup second solution feels the most robust to me in and probably use it if i need a fast lookup so you to depend on anyone to know that the key is the id of the object comes is better for passing the instead of two and you just pass is a rare but key values may not be valid as for i to map string to but since a valid variable name i had the second easily in case along the line you need to more data to some i know about your but this is third would be good if you need fast lookup time some of the advantages listed above the data if you need the fast lookup a lot more either you run the risk of error if the id in the object somehow varies from the id in

solution should be pretty and require axis of rotation to get from normal1 to normal2 must be orthogonal to so just take their amount of rotation is easily derived from their this value is but as the two normal vectors should be normalised it will give so just take the inverse cosine to get the rotation resulting vector and angle are the required parameters for no need to calculate the actual rotation matrix forget that needs the angle in but the normal c trig functions work in

sounds like what asking about involves serializing the data structure of a django model instance for the other posters are if you wanted the serialized form to be used with a python application that can query the database via then you would wan to serialize a queryset with one on the other what you need is a way to the model instance somewhere else without touching the database or without using then you have a little bit of work to what i i use for the it happened to be what i found but it might not be the my implementation depends on one of its but there should be similar ways with other implement a method on all models that you might need this is a magic method for but probably something going to want to think about no matter what implementation you the idea is that you return an object that is directly convertible to an array or if you really want to do this dictionary for field in return will not be helpful to you unless you have a completely flat data structure only numbers and strings in the you should seriously think about the right way to implement this call and you have what you

structured exception handling is has a when an exception windows first looks for a handler for the exception by following the registered exception handler chain head of which is stored in on the first dword in the segment pointed to by the fs segment register all that ugly logic go away in it just became less search is done by calling a function with a particular a pointer to which is stored in each exception frame on the points to the topmost each frame points to the previous the last frame on the list is one that has been provided by the os handler will pop up a dialog if an unhandled exception reaches functions normally check the type of the and return a code to indicate what to one of the codes that can be returned is this exception and if windows sees it will reset the instruction pointer to the point of the exception and resume another code indicates that this exception frame should handle the given a third code is not going to catch this keep windows keeps on calling these exception filter functions until it finds one that handles the exception one way or the windows finds one that handles the exception by catching then it will proceed to unwind the stack back to that which consists of calling all the functions only passing in a different at this point that the functions execute the up until the handler which executes the with the stack page guard the process is none of the exception handlers will elect to handle this because otherwise the stack growth mechanism would the filter search filters all the way through to the base exception handler provided by the which grows the stack allocation by committing the appropriate and then returns the appropriate return code to indicate that the os should continue where it left rather than unwind the tool and debugging infrastructure are designed to let these particular exceptions play out so you need to worry about handling can read more about seh in excellent article in msj from over a decade

suggested is a handy way to continually compile your document whenever the source but often when working on a document end up with errors and then will panic and wait for user input before that can get very especially recently when i hacked up something to compile directly from an which saves continuously as you there a setting for or to make it just abort with an error message if it if how would i set up some kind of expect script to had thought option would do the trick but apparently skim on mac osx is a nice pdf viewer that autorefreshes when the pdf changes that whenever a latex error it makes you reconfirm that you want texniscope have this but i had to ditch texniscope for is there a way to make skim always or is there another viewer that gets this on based on the answer to this the following to your os x with editing your source run the following in a or another realtime pdf viewer to view for just look at the tab in preferences and set it up for your hitting save on will now cause to refresh without touching a make me manually abort a latex compile when an	
suggestion covers and i think is if any of the 4 vertices of are inside then check if any of the 4 vertices of are inside how suggest to go about the vertex of checking is and the 4 vertices of are v1 all 5 vertices by a vector u by an orientation matrix multiply u by u assuming that in your convention orientation works by resulting 2nd call it is now axis aligned you can immediately check whether is contained in you found any inside of you have otherwise few optimizations immediately pop to mind you can store unrotated copies of the vertices in each if the sizes are maybe you can compare them to immediately eliminate one of the possible and save 3 potential but unless applying it on gazillions of box this test should be cheap enough as the you can get as deep as you want there look up and see for specifically remember some nice works by stephane i whole heartedly believe that no game does any of this fancy if you are indeed moving extremely you can subdivide your time step and perform collision checks on each there was another discussion about with nice	
suggestion is that you should make a backup of the project then you should run the migration wizard of vs when it asks you if you want to see a report of all the files changed during select it will display a list of files that were changed during the almost all files changed are limited to the project files in which the version number is there is no hard and fast rule that nothing else will be changed and you should not be relying on the best is to check the changes in each file that is mentioned in the changed the only files changed were the project you should be easily able to maintain the code in vs just change back the version in the project files when you need to	
suggestion works beautifully with one caveat the dynamic elements created with script will not be rendered if the user returns to the formset using the an issue that may be a deal breaker for user adds two new forms to the formset using the user populates the forms and submits the user clicks the back button in the formset is now reduced to the original all dynamically added forms are not is not a defect with script at but a fact of life with dom manipulation and suppose one could store the values of the form in the session and have some ajax magic when the formset loads to create the elements again and reload the values from the but depending on how anal you want to be about the same user and multiple instances of the form this may become very has a good suggestion for dealing with

suggestion would be to start with a simple this is something you can continue to use and expand as your skills progress and you start other more complicated in the most basic this consists of a page and a topic you could then add a user some login capabilities and a simple admin after rails was originally envisioned to make it easy to cms type you get this up and you can add some plugins to extend the functionality to include and or you can roll these capabilities up an account on github and learn how to use its and better than what you used before you should also learn and as these are huge timesavers and work hand in hand with rails and

suppose i could define every service operation into a single service but there could be quite a few operations and rather divide them into several cohesive service makes sense to group operations into cohesive service the granularity number of operations per service will depend on your but one service contract per operation seems splitting my operations into a set of service contracts mean that i would have to host each service on a separate at you can have several service contracts on the same could have a concrete class that implements several service contracts suggested by koistya navin is an internal implementation would only consider doing this if the operation contract implementations were so closely related that it makes sense to implement them in a single which case it may make sense to make them part of the same service	
suppose i have a struct like int int have a function which should set a new value for either or this function also requires to specify which variable to a typical example would be like int reasons i write here i cannot pass the pointer to to so i cannot call f with address of or thing i cannot do is to declare a vector within and pass an integer as index to basically in f i need to access the variables by with previous example is that in the future i plan to add more variables to struct and in that case i shall remember to add more if statements to which is bad for thing i could do is write f as a like int then i could call or would work but i like using my question is there a way to achieve the same goal using templates instead of try to explain why i cannot use pointers and i need access to variable by the structure contains the state of a this systems needs to its state when undo is handled using an interface called like void i cannot pass pointers to the undo method because of polimorfism contains variabiles of other types as i add a new variable to the structure i generally also add a new like public int void is i know pointer to s when i create the so i cannot save a pointer to in the costructor would have solved the class for is the just i have to write instead of this is a design i need an undo token per variable not one per templates be used to access struct variables by

take on this is that model binders should be constructing presentation not entity types from your the model binder should be a very simple mapping from the collection of the form to a presentation model which is mostly scalar values with possibly some relationships to other types that are mostly scalar values or having to materialize entity instances from a repository adds a lot of as you have using a presentation model has a large number of is never a need to whitelist the fields the user is allowed to since the presentation model contains only those default model binder will work for all but the most complex model binding in i find that i only need to use a custom model binder when the value the user sees has to be bound to some other value in a conditional when using a presentation model the structure of your presentation model should match the structure of the so you do not need to use a custom model binder for structural will be able to create your views and controllers before creating a database or entity this means you can get customer on your design before doing a large amount of the work to create the final this helps to sort out structural issues in the entity model before they just create a presentation model which matches the page you think the customer wants to build the general outline of the page using a instance of this presentation and show it to the if you can then build the model and write a linq query to map that to your presentation in your the subcategories would come in from the form collection as a list of the presentation model should have the same list of in the after you can call a method to transfer the model values from the presentation model to a materialized category instance from the

team has a number of processes which we run manually but which may run for many the processes do various things to large numbers of entities database obviously from time to time there are failures and we have to design or processes to handle these failures gracefully and move on so the whole job is not brought on the particular process in the severity and urgency of failures in some cases we send emails when a rare but important error in other cases we just log it and move and so problem is that we have different error handling code scattered everywhere and more often than not when we it and move no one ever goes back and reads the so no one ever knows what problems we default to email for all problems because there would simply be too many are long running processes but not daemons where something like snmp or nagios might feel like a good surely this is a fairly common problem but i cannot seem to find many solutions heard people talking about using log4j other similar logging to log to a which seems like it might be a step in the right but surely there are more sophisticated solutions out there by imagining something where your logger writes events to a database and a web interface that lets you see what errors are happening with what processes in real time as well as configure email alerts for specific something like this if what approaches have you used to successfully deal with similar what worth most of our codebase is in python but i would imagine any decent implementations of this idea are largely and obviously any conceptual solutions would be as i just spent some time looking at which is kind of what i am looking but like it to be a webapp instead of a desktop and have alerting i just discovered and which are both somewhat along the lines of what i was though both target rails are the best practices for tracking in long running

term is but in my internationalization we typically avoided the term character to refer to we used the term only for legacy encoding schemes that had one or more bytes to define each character encodings that require only one byte per along with chinese encodings are typically of the legacy with some require a sort of state machine model more a page swapping to and moving backwards in a text stream is complicated and and do not suffer from this as can be tested with a bitmask and can be tested against a range of surrogate so moving backward and forward in a document can be done safely without major few legacy for languages like thai and have some of the complexity of multibyte character sets but are really just built on combining and generally lumped in with the broad term

the algorithm that is the since you probably care about doing this in real generally for smaller blocks of the algorithms compress about the same or take a few mostly because the algorithms need to transmit the dictionary or huffman trees in addition to the highly recommend deflate by zlib and for a number of the algorithm is quite well bsd and is the only compression required to be supported by zip per the infozip aside from the when it determines that the compression is larger than the decompressed a store mode which only adds 5 bytes for every block of data block is 64k aside from the store deflate supports two different types of huffman tables dynamic and a dynamic table means the huffman tree is transmitted as part of the compressed data and is the most flexible varying types of nonrandom the advantage of a fixed table is that the table is known by all decoders and thus need to be contained in the compressed the decompression code is relatively written both java and javascript versions based directly off of zlib and they perform rather other compression algorithms mentioned have their i prefer deflate because of its runtime performance on both the compression step and particularly in decompression point of zip is not a compression it is a for doing packet i would bypass zip and just use the apis provided by

the content again after you load the simplest way tends to just add a null string to the	
the content of tables is an problematic since there is no simple and solution to achieve best and most secure way to do it requires you would achieve even horizontal scrolling easily included for with this technique i you can transform that to your problem i made 3 placed the middle table that holds the data inside a div set the div style to gave the header and footer table and the div each a width of surrounded everything by another div to control the overall table made very sure that the quantity of columns match in all three and that all three have the same styles regarding margins and the interesting below the last element of that table write a javascript block include it from a write a function that successively looks at each column a for starting with the first at every iteration of that check the td cell with of the first two tables in the current check which with is the bigger one and assign that to the smaller td you may want to apply that value to the footer call that you may want to do that in an interval or when special events such as new data in the cells using ajax for if you do scroll your columns sizes are but you will have to synchronize the scrolling position of your header and footer table with the content alternatively you just let the overall div scroll the whole thing but not that would be the job of the div that contains the data technique worked very well in all major browsers in an very coplex gantt diagram you can think of that concept easily in a 90 degrees rotated so that you fix the first and last header column when here is another example from my code base that might help you to get the contentdiv var var code does the it makes that an table with 3 columns always looks like the first and last column have the same and the center column has a width of 120 that does not apply directly to your special but it might give you a starting point in dynamic table manipulation through

the dark ages before there was a common pattern i used in my code which was to define a struct with a set of function pointers that operated on that struct in some way and provided particular behaviors for in i was just building a the difference was that i could the struct at runtime to change behaviors of individual objects on the fly as this offers a much richer model of inheritance at the cost of stability and ease of the greatest was that there was exactly one person who could write this code used this heavily in a ui framework that let me change the way objects got who was the target of and so on the fly something that very few uis this process formalized in oo languages is better in every meaningful

the data in the text file looks like this separated by x2 x3 can read the strings into a cell array using like now stores the strings in a cell to make a variable out of one of these strings and assign it a i would use 1 will create a variable in the base workspace and assign it the value 1 the first argument can be either or to create a variable in either the matlab base workspace or the workspace of the caller you would repeat this for each string name in giving it whatever value you is an alternate answer to the one i gave you the above answer addresses the specific problem you raised in your answer gives you a whole other option to potentially avoid doing things the way you were describing them in your and it will hopefully make things easier for i understand your you basically have 256 and you want to randomly pick 30 of each of these matrices sounds like it is stored in its own variable to i would suggest storing all 256 matrices in just one variable as either a initialize all matrices as 0 2 this enters a value for the first a cell initializes an empty array of 2 enters a value for the first would have to initialize all the values then if you want to randomly pick 30 you can next randomize the order of either the third dimension of the array or the order of the cell array by using the default order of the randomly order the numbers 1 to for a for a cell just use the first 30 entries in for your calculations of the individual variables like you were puts the first matrix from the array in puts the first matrix from the cell array in can keep repeating the use of randperm to keep generating new randomized arrays of if you have to keep track of which original matrices you are you have to add this line after you randomize the entries of will tell you the original position a matrix was for if the first array entry in is then the matrix in the first position of was originally the 40th matrix you entered when you initialized this

the example above probably indicates that something goes notimplementedexception itself is not wrong all about the contract of superclass and about subclass implementing this if your superclass has such this method is optional and may be not if not supported it should throw notimplementedexception to find out if it is supported or use void int not supporting this method is still ok with the if it is not you probably should disable corresponding action in so if you are ok with such then subclass implements it option when client explicitly declares that it does not use all class methods and is never going like this method never modifies it just iterates over them and gets elements by we decided to be not very bureaucratic and not define readonlylist and this is 3rd party library so you can not modify it void it is ok to pass there implementaion of list that does not support and other just document use with care this implementation does not implement entire list it does not support methods that modify the content of the readonlylistimpl implements having your code to define all your contract is as it your compiler to check if you violate the sometimes it is not reasonable and you have to resort to weakly defined like short words it comes to the if you really can safely use your subclass as taking into account that superclass is defined by its contract which is not only

the longer a string and the more similar two strings the longer they will take to compare a string 1000 characters long where the only difference is the last you can see how long it will take before routine discovers the lets contrast that cost of comparing a long string to the cost of locating them on are stored in which are balanced trees with a variable number of the and where each node is linked to the other b this gives us two quick look up by walking the and then tree order access to other nodes you find easy to find then are laid out in disk and in general the more nodes you can cram in to a index then the lower the overall height of the index the lower the tree the faster you will be able to find a specific since you will typically traverse the height of the tree to get to any one leaf lower the the fewer disk hits you have to if you have a tree 4 then to reach any random node requires loading 4 index pages in to and 4 disk a 4 high tree is as assorted values of as a 8 high the more you can put in an index the fewer hits need if you start iterating along the if your nodes hold 10 key loading a hundred rows will cost you 10 index page whereas if it only holds 5 per you get twice the index disk that you get a geometric progression in terms of number of records you need to add a new layer to the the difference between a 5 key node and a 10 key node is not twice the the value of have small keys lots of fan out in your index with a still have to do hash and it really comes down to your data access how busy is the what kind of queries you how much ram you have to cache index index hit to locate your initial row may well not even be on the radar of your query key takeaway is that the number of records but the fan out of the index tree for if you have a 1k index and a 4 byte index you can get 250 nodes per index very simplistic and a 3 layer tree can 16m rows all within a 3 deep tree any of 16m rows within 3 disk

the past six been using nhibernate with active record at and lightspeed at home in my spare found both lightspeed and nhibernate with active record to be straightforward to found drawbacks with lightspeed the features i like most over this saves a lot of time and provides consistent model class and config for linq and mysql features i like most about active record xml configuration the most common configuration options are provided flexibility is still available when required criteria drawbacks of active record for me appear to be more ruby on rails code examples than compared both products side by side and run performance tests on both would guess that nhibernate suffers from a deeper class while optimising my code using ants i found that for a simple query there is call after call through nhibernate classes before the actual sql query is the query that is produced that will make all the difference to the ultimate performance of the lightspeed and nhibernate offer lazy and active record makes this easy for think it is easier to optimise your queries using lightspeed with and more clear to people maintaining your whereas not usually recommended to write nhibernate

the thing you are having trouble with is defining the proper the interface defines the interaction between the subscriber and the make a winforms like static class the main entry point for the static void interface void class observerlist public void foreach titem in are making two things the first the interface which the subscribers will then a list for the publisher to hold all the make form one with two one labeled form 2 and the other labeled form then add a then another button labeled public partial class form1 private new private observerlist myobservers new public private void eventargs form2 frmnewform new private void eventargs form3 frmnewform new private void eventargs private void eventargs deliberately set up the form2 button and the form3 button to make multiple copies of each type of for you can have twelve up at will notice that after creating each form i put it into the observers i am able to do this because both form2 and form3 implement after i show the form i call refresh on the observer list so the new form is updated with the latest note i could have cast it to a variable of iobserver and updated just that i am trying to be as brief as for the add button i pull the text from the textbox store it in my datalist and then refresh all the make add a list box and the following public partial class form2 public private void eventargs void foreach s in add a combobox and add the following public partial class form3 public private void eventargs void foreach s in will notice that each form implements the refresh method of the iobserver interface slightly one is for a listbox the other for a combo the use of interfaces is the key element a real world application this example would be more for example instead of passing the string list in the refresh it would not have any instead the publisher in this would implement a publisher interface and register itself with the observers as they are being each observer would be able to accept a publisher in initialization then when it is refreshed it would pull the string list out of the publisher via a method exposed through the more complex applications with multiple types of data this allows you customize what data the form implementing iobserver is pulling out of the course if you only want the observer to be able to display a string list or specific then pass it as part of the the interface makes explicit what want each layer to this way 5 years from now you can look at the code and code that what it is

the worry about bits on the wire but the overhead of reading and the tend to favor short names inside function and make function names as long as but as short as possible without loosing useful doubt it is a it depends on whether you want your code to resemble natural language or be more implicit and prefix variable names to inject context information into i if that is the ide should provide such injection capabilities as a visual overlay on the code via context next version of visual studio will make such annotation gymnastics much easier via a extensibility mechanism extended deep into the editor i have not used visual studio for editing javascript see now that your concern is indeed the space this should ever be an always always always favor readability over bits on the since compression as noted by the other only thing i would add is the which is that sometimes comprehension is made easier with compact names over excessively long but it is harder to get short names long names are much easier and faster to make right in my reason for short names should never be data compression only cognitive what works is

there is a especially in java or other oo basic is that your command parser is a finite state the start state is an empty line index at the start of a think about echo foo bat the line into a the grammar is usually noun noun so interpret it that you can do it with a sequence of if but a hash is you load the hash with strings as and index something it could be just a which would go into a is hashtable cmds new enum cmdindx get the token into switch case process get each successor token and copy it to recognize the process you can apply the command and object factory now you have a class public interface command public void public command public class echo implements command public void the code is foreach noun in echo public command this clones the object and returns your code load the hashtable cmds new new one for each token is in the or are in a how this you look up the object in the you call the method to get a new you then invoke the processing for that command using the may be a bit in that it uses the factory why have a factory use that so that each time you execute a the object the instance of can have its own internal if you need state to persist for a long you can simplify this to it simply gets and uses the object you created when you instanciated it with new	
there is a sniffer class in the csv module that can be used to guess a given delimiter and quote its strategy is from for text enclosed between two identical probable which are preceded and the same character probable quote with the most same with the there is no quotechar the delimiter be that try the delimiter occur the same number of times due to malformed it may we all or nothing so we allow for small variations in a table of the frequency character on every a table of freqencies of occurred 5 times in 10 in 1000 7 times in the mode of the determine the for that out how often the meets that character that best meets is the performance the data is evaluated in so it and evaluate the smallest portion of the data chunks as not going to quote the source code here in the lib directory of every python that csv can also use semicolons instead of commas as delimiters in german versions of csvs are because commas are used as decimal separators in

these questions are more about seeing the interviewer wrestle with the and the error boundary cases and the choice of suitable environment for the more than they are about the actual function here is written around the closed 4 cycle if the function f is only permitted to land only on signed 32bit then the various solutions above will all work except for three of the input range numbers as others have pointed minint will never satisfy the functional so raise an exception if that is an i am permitting my python function to operate on and return tuples the task spec admits it only specifies that two applications of the function should return an object equal to the original object if it is an would be asking for more detail about the allows my orbits to be nice and and to cover all of the input integers i originally envisaged the cycle to visit half integer but i want to get tangled up with rounding hence the tuple which is a way of sneaking complex rotations in as without using the complex arithmetic that no state needs to be preserved between but the caller does need to allow the return value to be either a tuple or an if return a if 0 raise valueerror make sure the tuple is well else return elif int if x this value satisfy the functional relation signed 2s complement 32 bit raise else send this integer to a tuple else not an int or a raise applying f to 37 twice gives and vice x x x x x f twice to zero gives x x we handle the one case for which the problem has no solution x x recent call file line in x file line in raise you think the function breaks the complex rule by mimicking the 90 degree rotations of multiplying by we can change that by distorting the here the tuples represent half not complex if you trace the orbits on a number you will get nonintersecting loops that satisfy the given functional n 2 if n is and not y is 2 and x is not more than implement this f2 by modifying and there are other have the intermediate landing points be rational numbers other than half a fraction module that might prove need a sign exercise has really nailed for me the delights of a dynamically typed i see a solution like this in

thing i think you need to consider is that a generic collection is not always a drop in replacement for a for can simply be plugged in for an instance of they have very different behavior in a number of scenarios that can and will break switching between these two collections forces a good programmer to examine the use cases to ensure the differences do not bite

thing that often helps is to use a lightweight memory if you combine this with allocation methods any until all done with the you can get something ridiculously did this for an embedded system mostly for performance but it saved a lot of memory as trick was basically to allocate a big block slightly bigger than need could allocate a chain of blocks if you and just keep returning a pointer it up by rounded up to maximum align requirement of 4 in our each this cut our overhead per alloc from on the order of bytes down to 3 we also ignored calls until we were all done parsing and then freed the whole clever enough with your frame allocation you can save a lot of space and it might not get you all the way to your but it would be worth looking at how much space overhead you really my experience with systems is that they use tons of small each with a relatively high you have virtual a large might not even hurt that if your access at any given time is local to a page or three you have to keep the memory you actually need in the long but the becomes a lot more efficient this	
thing to consider is using an raii class to manage the allocation of course only useful if your macro can be restricted to you want to avoid hitting the heap for performance take a look at the techniques used by matthew template class this will allocate on the stack unless your runtime size request exceeds a size specified at compiler time so you get the speed of no heap allocation for the majority of allocations you size the template but everything still works correctly if your exceed that stlsoft has a whole lot of cruft to deal with portability you may want to look at a simpler version of which is described in found it quite handy in an embedded	
thing to try is to create a new team project logged in to the tfs server using the account that you used to install tfs that still work then sounds like you might possibly have your sharepoint admin url set incorrectly in thing you might want to try if the best practices which comes with the 2008 power and will point out common configuration might also want to try the configureconnections command to see if you can see anything	
thing to watch out for particularly if you are using a is to check if the application is regenerating session ids between requests anything that depends explicitly on the session id will run into although obviously the rest of the data in the session will the application is regenerating session ids like this then you can end up with a situation where an ajax request in effect invalidates replaces the session id in the requesting	
things stand out in my was designed before unix at the isolating yourself from the host os seemed like a great idea since to have a decent level of integration with all the operating systems in use would be prohibitively and on top of that would make things that should be simple ridiculously the backwards that common lisp has to do to support things like the vax now it just looks of free at the it been demonstrated that a language needed a solid implementation to pick up people still thought that selling was a good way to make seem like really obvious mistakes in but i guess you just had to be

think a few more steps to accomplishing your which is understanding the basics of game you mentioned understanding sprites and which are imperative to game but i think that initially you should spend a little time understanding the programming and methodology behind general graphical user of what language you will eventually program your game i think that learning in a modern language like java or will provide you with a vast amount of libraries and will allow you to accomplish tasks like animation and event listeners much more is a list of guides and tutorials that i think will be extremely helpful to you just as they were to me and is an for a java game framework that includes full source code and a full walk through source of writing the infamous game in complete with a control score and sound book java 5 game by jonathan harbour will introduce you to concepts such as 2d vector graphics and bitmap including sprite plus you can get it used on amazon marketplace for is an unbelievable tutorial on sprite animation that has more than 5 parts to plus written by richard a professor of compsci and an extremely reliable and knowledgeable for more tutorials by is his these sources going to possess the methodology of the parts that go into a which are applicable in any as well as the knowledge of how those parts can be actually implemented as	
think a good idea to create a tparam with a variant variable a tobject something work but it seems very messy to pascal is not a dyanmically typed language and i try and treat it as i would suggest another function to handle so as well as having avalue avalue handle your data or create a record that defines your data for example instead of having tparam of variant and object have something so maybe you have so much different data that the route is the best but it seems like a bit of a maintenance headache when your other code gets passed an array of variant how do you know which variant is which and how to use each of them in your stored	
think a good idea to use dataavailable for this the end of your response is whatever your protocol says it better to use blocking calls like read to read your and use whatever protocol established to determine to read and how it might be that not all data you want is because read return when all your data is but when some data is so you need to check on how much was your protocol is likely want to respond to every single byte as with a terminal you want to echo it or process commands or what is perhaps suited to check if a read would block when called will return with whatever is in the but it makes your loop less van den	
think a pain vs pleasure not to put code in a python config file because all valid but it does mean you could confuse a user who comes in to reconfigure an if that worried about rope it off with comments explaining roughly what it does and that the user edit rather edit the for your nigh on for developers to test then deploy their definitely more pleasure than but you should really do this from import in your if nothing but to make it clear what that file what doing there splits overrides into two

think i found a solution that feel free to chime in if any of you have a better my button i placed the following onclientclick event calls my fadeout method below which returns false if the current content is faded in and returning false cancels altogether the asynchronous postback that the updatepanel would have the animation is done i set the isfadedin variable to false and click the button again know that the code to click the button is not cross browser compatible right this is just a proof of concept so that piece of it will need to be since isfadedin is set to this time the fadeout method does not return a false and so the updatepanel performs the got an event handler attached to the pageloaded event so that i can fade the new content in once it is done i can now finish my animations before loading the new i have to wait for the animation to finish before starting the postback so users actually have to wait a little opacity isfadedin if if opacity opacity else isfadedin if if opacity opacity else isfadedin return

think in that i would make a process to manage the database editor that want to make some modifications to the database makes a call to this be it through ipc or or whatever process can then notify the player of a change in the the when he wants to retrieve some data should make a request of the data it wants to the process managing the the db process tells it what it when it notifies of a so no request from the player this will have the advantage of having only one process accessing the sqlite so no locking or concurrency issues on the

think it counts the references to try other import astrd astrd refcount for 9802374987193847 fits is probably because numbers are if you for example use a it will always be 2 a clean prompt that i get 2 for 123 as perhaps your setup is somewhat or it might be time related or	
think it depends on how you installed note that you can have multiple installs of i do on my if you install via an msi of a version of python or i believe it creates a registry key like gives this value on my just read the registry key to get the you can install python via an xcopy like model that you can have in an arbitrary and you just have to know where it is	
think it depends on what happens to the data later if only ever going to access the data using and why not test the methods in i suppose a chance that a bug will arise and be slightly harder to figure out whether in or but consider that an acceptable risk if your test easier to the as you the data will be read or inserted the database using some other then check the database using sql as you makes a good though whichever method you decide be inserting data in the a good idea to clear out the data before and after the tests to ensure that you can achieve consistent	
think it is assumed that an html page should have a head most even if not strictly required by some the openid standard seems to its tags to be placed in the head do other sites detect your openid when not in	
think it is possible to have nhibernate eager load the property you should be able to write a query to get the current owner of a it looks like you already have a vehicle with i would add a method like that takes one the id of the then have your property call this method by passing in its own query might look like property path to the ownervehicle join

think making very clear that the most frequent participants get the most input is we have one client for our latest app that is in every meeting where the others tend to be occasionally as a the features that are adjusted added to the app are more useful to the one if you can get them to understand that their feedback truly shapes the end product they are likely to want to be	
think meant that you should strip processing the so that you can write the xslt as you would for a normalized what assumes that the multiple body tags have no content between this would not remove the content of the body note that be removing anything from a body tag to an this would leave in place the initial and final in other words with input like good more good be targeting those two tags in the removing these would yield a continuous good more good

think of a framework as a pattern that an application can conform defined in a set of class library might mean several things depending on the it could refer to classes that are designed to be derived which is a common approach in or it could merely refer to a core library of classes that are assumed to be useful in any application and so are considered a almost part of the language container	
think of a question like to have and try to find the when you get tired of reading go read the dev mailing the or no royal road to understanding a large code if you enjoy that sort of thing in for some if guide books really so you really that much worse	
think of a way to do but if willing to modify code a you might get a bit of help from yaml easy to use markup importing the yaml library gives every object a which will serialize the entire so it can be saved to a and objects can be restored from yml as that would require adding a bit of code to periodically but the actual saving bit could be relatively yaml is so no download i suppose the real ruby way to do this would be to have the backup function yield a block or no better way i can think be interested to read a better response to this	
think of any way to do this with standard could write a plugin for that manages referential integrity between the parent and child tables on different and against child query for matching row in parent fail if no match found in parent against parent query for dependent rows in child fail if any dependent rows found in child if the constraint is intended to support cascading do that instead of against parent if the primary key value is changing as part of the query for dependent rows found in child fail if any dependent rows found in child if the constraint is intended to support cascading do that instead of that have to keep information about the referential integrity constraints in your mysql proxy plugin write a custom config file for your plugin that records the you use conventional syntax to declare such constraints across mysql

think of it in terms of i use new when i use new when you are assigning can be part of a first example is the second is a needless waste of runtime	
think one of the problems that having is that you are somewhere between not giving you enough knobs and but the problem complicated enough for you to write something more this reach for something like it more event driven so it can walk across your xml and give you control when you want once you get the element you you can do whatever you like with things like various things like xpath and so on can be useful in the same they are built to look deep into xml to pull out parts of unlike which just gives you a data d	
think only we programmers have the habit of typing even before the page gets loaded of the friends i have wait till they see the signal from the loading the 2 issues above are les annoying than having to move our mouse tab everytime to type in what we want in sites which do not have focus on a particular websites browsers be programmed so that focus change if the user is already interacting with the site or the think browsers should be enabled to do this than the becauase it will be another trip back to server and can be frustrating for connections with low i think this is just another minor which we can live as i said only we programmers jump in type even before the page most of my friends dont know that they can type before the page gets loaded

think that any option is it depends on your application used dbms and other we used multiple simple queries with in our standalone but when we evolved our product towards lightweight solution we discovered that our framework made huge number of request and that killed performance cause of network so we sufficiently reworked our framework for using aggregated complex we still maintained our solution and moved from oracle light to apache and once more we found that some of our new queries should be simplified as derby performed them too look at your real problem and solve it i think that simple queries are good for beginning if there are no strong objectives against	
think that autowiring by type will work in this as the autowire candidate will most likely be the itself of the reference this leads to all those layers you have to dig through to get your original passing a reference to the bean via xml configuration annotating the property with should work as	
think that if the generated code is more or less the same as you would write then go well you will hardly have to go back and tweak it a couple of months from after you get your code generated and make some then find peace in that project	
think that one object per table is necessarily a good hard to give a one size fits all but objects can be richer and more fine a database can be denormalized for reasons that apply to in that have more objects than case would include and class private class private	
think that possible to control the autogenerated at least with the current creating a new control that inherits from the you might have a bit more control of the way the columns are but not shure if it is doable still be worth to the msdn the autogeneratecolumns is set to an object is automatically created each field in the data field is then displayed as a column the gridview control in the order the fields appear in the data this option provides a convenient to display every field in the you have control of how an generated column field is displayed generated bound fields are not added to the of letting gridview control generate the column you manually define the column fields setting the property to false and then creating custom columns in to bound column you can display a button column a box column a command hyperlink column an or a column field based on own for see	
think that the main difference is that marshalling supposedly also involves the in other you would not be able to marshal and unmarshal an object into a instance of a different just means that you can store the object and reobtain an equivalent even if it is an instance of another being they are typically	
think that the main reasons that is not a keyword no compelling reason for it to the designers of the c and languages have always preferred to have language features be implemented in the library if possible and keywords to a language can create problems for an existing body of legacy this is another reason they are generally resistant to adding new in discussing the next major revision of the had this to improvements should be done in such a way that the resulting language is easier to learn and among the rules of thumb for the committee standard library facilities to language extensions

think that there is an automatic way of doing but you could always use to traverse the visual tree of your silverlight and pick out the value of any controls that interest it be easier to just bind the controls to properties on a viewmodel you could add a method to the class that would then build the post request for based on the properties that it is	
think that using mysql is an overkill for the task of collecting the logs and summarizing stick to plain log files in your it does not provide the full power of relational database management but quite enough to generate a simple file operation on a modern os is seamless and on the using mysql for the same simple operation loads the cpu and may lead to swapping and other hell of the storage as with plain text file be able to store years of logs of a highly loaded website taking into account current hdd ratio and compressability of plain text

think the buzzwordiness of calling it is actually detracting from its usefulness and the wider adoption of the i read up on i think the claim that it was oo actually slowed my understanding of what it really who know what means in programming will be because not is just an attempt to apply some oo principles to css to improve its and on the other most developers will not understand the concept at all if not and so just be baffled or great needs maximum power css css css something like

think the number 1 reason from a management standpoint is for perceived if you work on more than one project at the same time stakeholders are able to see progress if you hold one project off then the stakeholders of that project may not like that nothing is being worked on more than 1 project also minimizes risks for example if you work on one project first and that project takes longer than expected you could run into issues with the second stakeholder also most likely want their project done holding one off due to another project can make them reconsider going ahead with the on what the projects are you might be able to leverage work done in one for the if they are similar then doing both at the same time could be of if you do them in sequence only the subsequent projects can benefit from the previous often projects are not a constant stream of sometimes developers are busy and sometimes if you only work on 1 project at a time a developer and other team members would likely be doing nothing while the more tasks are taking managing the time over more than one project allows teams to get more done in a shorter a developer i prefer working on multiple projects as long as the timelines are as long as not being asked to do both at the same time with no change in the schedule i am often if stuck on one project i can work on the it depends on the projects	
think the problem is in the code that more likely in the code that implements the datasource for your table

think the thing you are not understanding is that the kernel is running on the cpu at every timer interrupt per the scheduler runs on each cpu and chooses a process to there is no one cpu that somehow tells the others to start running a works by just setting flags on the the scheduler reads these flags and will not run that process on its cpu if it is set not

think there are basically three reasons for growth have you ever used i know about most but for none of the marketing material on the gwt site was very then i ran into a little small personal project that required integration with google maps and app i decided to try gwt since the tools made it so using it even for an extremely modest project has completely changed my i suspect this means there has been a lot of word of mouth propagation of the framework over the past 6 the early versions used by google all that much and were a bit rough around the the latest releases seem to have solved most of the growing pain issues compile times are still too and have turned it into a usable started including a set of default i think this has helped their demos to look quite a bit more impressive for recent whereas some people were confused in the past by the out of the approach that the project had be really shocked if any of these apply outside of java i seen gwt making inroads into environments at and i think their current direction makes success even more	
think there are five is as sandboxed as possible array access bound this eliminates things like c and but opens the possibility for and tools provide meaningful error that eliminates a some great languages have completely unreadable error which would mean you end up on the phone trying to figure it is possible to get obvious manifestations preferably and tools are preferably that has an interactive debugger within an you choose to go with one of the teaching that might be a good but they must be kiddie would suggest staying out of most scripting languages as they are not very intuitive to debug and to understand errors think java is a great especially as it comes with great free ides like it is possible to use it without having to know too much about it has an interactive and generally gives sensible error your father eventually chooses to head in the gui there are friendlier lightweight apis that are easier to learn and use than you were using a i would say might be a good choice as but as a mac i have the same issue with ms	
think there are several important can do anything in or almost any other finally all of them turing complete the question is it suits your is one and extreamly important limitation of it runs only single platform is still not are many applications where gc is just a waste of applications that afford you throw up of memory untill next gc data video auido processing and many other mission critical time applications video processing and so gc makes life much harder for most of desktop web word desktop environment itself windows kde or are written in compiled languages with careful thinking about they would just be terrible bloated	
think there are three steps in this you believe that there should always be a comparison inside an so you write more realistically string f new you learn that it is fine to ask and that this formatting allows better reading as a sentence in this example this is a at you get old and you learn that is not very and that gives your poor brain some clue what is happening and that all these harsh claims of yada are all a little as for the in java it would not make a shred of i think is so much this is the easiest optimization a compiler could i would bet some money that the performance is the

think this is a great begun a series of blog posts about it answer is correct in the narrowest let me rephrase in my own words implicitly including some of the is no value in operations that are not cpu there is little value in operations that are only cpu bound short periods of less a few hundred doing so will most likely cause program to be more and learning how to implement fine parallelism is complicated and it well is is true as far as it but i belive the answer is richer for a broader set of there are many reasons to use and then implicitly techniques in your production for it is a huge benefit to your users to move disk and network operations off your user interface has nothing to do with increasing the throughput of compute bound and everything to do with keeping a user interface you need a graphical ui here command line and server based can benefit for this as completely agree that taking a cpu bound operation and paralyzing it can often be a complex task requiring knowledge of fine grained cpu cpu instruction this can be classically i would argue that the need to do his is there are just not that many problems that need this kind of fine grained they do exist and may deal this this every but i would argue that in the day to day life of most this is pretty there are good reasons to learn the fundamentals of and thus can make your program more responsive from a user perspective by moving longer operations off the message loop for things that are not cpu it can often make sense to do them in can break up complex single threaded state machines into more procedural the os already does a lot for you and you can use libraries that are enabled operating systems and libraries are not magic i argue that it is valuable for most develops to learn the basics of this will let you write better software that your users are happier not every program should be or it is just fine for some things to be implemented in a simple single threaded take this as advice that every program should be use your own good judgment it can often be a valuable technique and very beneficial in many as mentioned i plan on blogging about this a bit starting feel free to follow along and post comments there as you feel	
think this is more a preference i am big fan of keeping things simple and for this reason i would suggest you break out your operations into separate stored will be more transparent and also aide any performance tuning you may have to do in if your update is performing you can immediately isolate it as the cause whereas if the logic is part of a much larger procedure with varying crud the root cause of the issue will not be quite so

think this might be a big reason databases are typically limited in functionality than local app engine up to 1000 simpledb times within 5 joining records two tables in a single query databases optimized for engine offers specialized storage query types such as database layer of a cloud can be abstracted as a layer within a stack but developers are most to use the local solution for both speed and niall

think you could learn more by having a pet project that you really that way you can work on it in your spare time and yet have its also a great place to apply those new technologies that you otherwise dont get an opportunity to apply it helps to think about something else and forget about programming totally for like learning to cook or gardening it kinda refreshes the mind and next time you start programming you got a fresh brain to hack around for well an hour each day is generally good

think you need to profile you might be right about it saving a few gb but thats relatively little on of you need real data about what is being served most and work on if you do find it is images that send your bandwidth usage so high you first should check your caching headers and 304 you also might want to investigate using something like amazon s3 to serve your i have managed to reduce bandwidth costs a lot by doing if the exif data is really making that much of a difference then you can use the gd library to copy a jpeg image using the this copy exif

think you really should be looking at wcf for but for look at something like wscf services contract which defines the contracts in xml and generates a set of libraries reusable across you define a namespace and use that namespace in multiple the code generation then builds a shared library of types which get used across all the we use this extensively in our 2 solutions and we had to do some additional work around the code generation to get it to fit into our build but once that was done we never looked migrating to over so the wscf will become the link to the site for

think you should share your profile in a brief to get a better hibernate and spring are hot and you will find them in all job requirements posted for enterprise so you are on the right track as far as your selection choices is hibernate is trickier than reason for that spring by virtue of its architecture is least invasive to the is little api to to code in you have to really code anything beyond to code you need to know the hibernate apis and the gotchas of hibernate the basics of hibernate are easy to but to learn the tricks and it takes i was the hiring manager and were using hibnernate and would rather take someone who was stronger on hibernate rather than someone who was stronger on far as spring is you as a contributing will have little to worry likely the application will already have a framework in and you will have to plug in your contributions to code in like i said its better if you have soem experience on i know everyone has a different viewpoint on so you maybe getting more confused once you share a bit of your it will help people give you a better good luck	
think you teach it but once basic concepts of programming are good example is the last stroustrup book principles and practice using where he teach how to make a usage and gui usage before even talking about think it will be a good reference for teaching because it is more natural to understand the way we build ideas instead of how much constraints management for we have to handle at the same time to make a software i really recommand you this book to have a fresh perspective about teaching fundamentals of

think your data source control itself would need to be the target for any it is only going to work with the data that you get from it you should optimize your or the data put into it before sending it off to sql you should optimize your application	
think your insertion code is only allocating memory but then doing many incrementing the value stored in the single allocated location between hash table stores your so it will end up associating each key with the same you should probably use with for i always recommend using on objects rather than on their that way you repeat yourself in quite as dangerous a instead guint32 a a way you the so that you always allocate enough room to store whatever points even if you later change the you should take a hard look at every cast you casting any pointer to is a sign of a hesitant with is just a synonym for so that cast is never it just adds cruft to your making it harder to

this is wide community using all kind of different it seems like appropriate place to ask you like to compile or do you prefer ask this because i tend to program things in small scripting languages with chosen modules i actually need autohotkey instead of mainstream languages with full blown ides and big libraries where every little change require to load and recompile the like the ability that the only tool i actually need to the project is any editor available on any system i happen to run the script of the interpreter which is single executable that i can either carry with me or download it instantly from internet and just save it on disk without any kind of installation also feel good to know that anybody wanting to update the project require anything else but the editor no notorious compilation dependency problems and that anybody that like the button i put can open the file and put it wherever he wants or even delete it in a matter of ask this because i noticed that there are some programmers that tend to think that anything that native executable good i even remember one post on the forum where i keep one of my open source applications another programmer said but it you prefer compiled or scripted

this question is getting quite if this is the first time reading this i suggest you start near the bottom as the solution is there in a round about but the code is a bit reading a on i was able to change my existing class to support generic many objects are already dependent on so looking for a way of making a method generic rather than the entire tried the but it looks like this behavior want the entire class to be t foobar2 public return fb2 this supposed to not or is it a bug elsewhere that getting confused reference to put this in to some sort of perspective as to what i want to how do it in class public t where t return class foobar2 foobar1 fb1 new fb2 there any way i can do something similar to that in corrected some minor syntax details meant to make foo and return not still getting compiler when i remove the template behavior the error goes the answer so far say what doing is but if it is then why am i getting the error thanks for your the actual source code what i think is anwyay let me know if you think skipped an important imagematrix public various functions t imagefilter public various functions create a new instance of imagematrix and return filter2 the actual compiler undefined reference to the everything but the implementation line is located in a so being called from a separate does this its all in the same all blocks are different files i comment out the implementation line filter2 it builds so it seems to be this line thats causing 5 having could this be a problem with the scratch grasped the concept of templates the template definition must be in the header along with the declaration so now that moved the declaration in to everything had to use to get it is this if way off please correct this is in the header this looks really really imagematrix image imagematrix return to update when i use imagematrix image imagematrix return i get this error in member function t instantiated from conversion from to type error if i use all of that smelly code in update imagematrix public t imagematrix return i get the same error as in update support individual generic methods rather than generic

those of you with curriculum development what is the best strategy regarding have seen some schools that teach arrays after variables and control often before even teaching this allows teaching of some rudimentary it then brings the problem of how to pass arrays to so it is necessary to go back to arrays pointers are taught and patch things option is to go from variables and control structures to and then teach and once you have teach arrays from and then use that to get to dynamic memory me the second option makes more because unlike simple with arrays it is easy to out of but students who did not yet learn about memory and pointers may not understand what lies outside these interested to know what others teaching is it better to teach arrays before or after

time depends on a few of the size of the communication between and your integration projects take less time to very or huge projects will take more time to been on small projects where integration was been on huge projects spread across multiple component teams where integration took a very long to integrate also depends on how well you project communication across if your teams are not communicating it can take 3x or more time to integrate and work out all the related integration helps with the perception that integration takes less with ci the time to integrate is amortized over the life of the but again if you have a poor relationship with the other component teams to total time for all integrations will take is definitely better than the waiting until late in the development cycle to integrate is bound to cause you much the earlier you begin the integration the more comfortable each team becomes with the

to write programs correctly is extremely difficult and time the first step replace the implementation with one that use multiple threads at carefully put threading back in and only you discover a genuine need for when figured out some very simple safe ways to do a implementation that works reliably is far better than a broken threaded ready to favour designs that use queues to transfer work items between threads and take care to ensure that those work items are accessed only by one thread at a to avoid just spraying blocks around your code in the hope that it will become it two code paths will acquire the same locks in a different and everything will grind to a halt every two on a this is especially likely if you combine threads with firing and you hold the lock while you fire the event the handler may take out another and now you have a pair of locks held in a particular what if taken out in the opposite order in some other this is such a big and difficult subject that i think it is potentially misleading to give a few pointers in a short answer and say you sure not the intention of the many learned people giving answers but that is the impression many get from summarised this is a very nicely worded summary this also comes the biggest is that can lead to vastly more having multiple threads not in itself create the interaction between the that creates this whether or not the interaction and can result development as well as ongoing susceptibility to and for it pays to keep interaction in a simple or not use multithreading all unless you have a penchant for and summary from traditional way of dealing with concurrency by letting a bunch threads loose in a single address space and then using locks to try cope with the resulting data races and coordination problems probably the worst possible in terms of correctness

traditional applications that run on the desktop of a computer i recommend variants of the the class responsible for creating and managing the form is a thin shell that passes events to the ui the interact with the form via a in term the ui object implements a interface and registers itself with a view controller that is situated lower in the object then execute object implementing the which modifies the the command object can interacts with the various views via the interfaces exposed by the view this does is allow you to rip off the form classes and replace them with stub classes that implement the form the stub classes are used for automated testing especially for integration interfaces precisely define the interaction between the the commands and the they can be designed to be relatively language agnostic so they can make porting between platform you are missing in your example are command you need this itemlist in the would register with the itemviewimplementation using the sequence of events would look something like wants to update the on the ui that clicking with a form tells through that x has with y itemviewimplementation a command object with it needs from command object take the modifies the model tells through to update the itemviewimplementation tells to update the the itemviewforms advantage of this approach is that the interaction of each layer is precisely defined through the software actions are localized into the command the form layers is focused on display the the view layer is responsible for routing actions and response between the commands and the commands are the only things modifying the also you have the advantage of ripping off the forms implementation to substitute any ui you want including mock object for unit

truly mathematical way to look at building a recursive function would be as imagine you have a function that is correct for build f such that is build such that is is how you can prove that the function is and called it is equivalent to have different base or more complicated functions on multiple it is also equivalent to imagine that is correct for all for a build a function that can determine if it is possible to have a coin combination of 5 cents and 7 cents to make x for possible to have 17 cents by 2x5 but impossible to have 16 imagine you have a function that tells you if possible to create x as long as x call this function it should be fairly simple to imagine how to make the function for now build your if 7 return else if 5 return return trick here is to realize that the fact that works for means that you can substitute for if 7 return else if 5 return return last thing to do is to have a base case to stop infinite note that if you are trying to create 0 then that is possible by having no adding this condition if return else if 7 return else if 5 return return can be proven that this function will always using a method called but that necessary you can imagine that only calls lower values of and will always eventually reach use this information to solve your tower of hanoi i think the trick is to assume you have a function to move tablets from a to b any trying to move n tables from a to

undergraduate project dealt with transcribing notes from a wav file to a midi we handled only the simple case of one possibly playing more than one note at a time for our research into the subject before we started showed that even only one is considered the problem what frequencies are playing at any given this can be done by a of small windows one at a some heuristic to guess which frequencies are harmonies of the same and which belong to different this be easy if you know what instrument is but hard in the general because the magnitudes of each harmony differ by for you might have two cs one octave apart from one or you might have one c but from a different you know what notes are playing at each you have to guess when you have breaks in the you could have one long note or a series of short depending on the size of the windows you used for the initial you could have different results if you have more than one instrument at a and no two are playing the same notes or harmonies thereof at one you be able to tell the instruments apart using some heuristic on the magnitudes of the harmonies or on the sequences of notes most likely there will be times when two instruments are playing the same then you really have any way to decide if there is one instrument playing the two instruments playing at the same one playing soft and the other playing loud or any combination the short list of problems to i know of any algorithm that solves this in the general i think this problem has been solved my project presentation can be found at

understand of control adapters is that designed to allow different html rendering for different browsers you register them in the it appears people are just registering adapters for the default browser and are using them to generally override the render method of you believe this is if why you just inherit from a control and override the render method that rather than use an benefit of overriding is that you can add more properties to which you do with just want to make sure not missing some secret sauce that makes adapters better than not rendering for specific why use an adapter over extending the	
understand that couchdb works purely with json since json is tempting to believe that more naturally suited for dynamic xml is generally untyped and scala has very good library support for creating and manipulating for an exploration of xml with with the proper library dealing with json can feel natural even in static for one approach to dealing with json data in see this object databases in sometimes convenient to define a for a class in the and use json or xml or some other untyped document language to be a serialized representation of the proper library support can then translate between the serialized form and the data with static typing and all the goodies that come with for one example of this see record which has added conversions to and from	
understand that it is more secure you use different but take my word for not a i even play one on reason i it to be more secure is that using extra information for encoding multiple keys and an unknown number of keys you publish the fact that encryption using the same key makes many codes easier to heard this for some codes but i it to be true for rot13 think the security scheme used by kerberos is a better one than simple double actually have one master key whose sole purpose is to encrypt the session key and the master key is used the session key is used to encrypt the real traffic and it has a limited this has two dudes have time to crack the session key by the time managed to do those session keys are no longer in same evil dudes get an opportunity to crack the master key simply because so rarely used would need a great many encrypted packets to crack the as i take that with a big grain of i work for the but then have to tell you that even if i did work for the you crack me that my kerberos depending on your is the mythological dog that guards the gates of a mascot for that security that same dog is called fluffy in the harry potter world once had a girlfriend whose massive german shepherd dog was called a similarly misnamed

upsizing a backend ms access database to sql the client will remain an access application for the time being about 30k lines of aim is to eventually allow synchronisation of the database accross multiple servers using replication but probably the sync all primary keys in the access tables are autoincrement integer not asking about the process of upsizing but about whether i should use guid or another codification for the pk know i could split the number range accross but i want to do that and allow the pk to be created on the client if for instance in offline assured easy to manipulate in especially when using them as filters for subforms or in insert performance due to their more than one canonical binary that need to be codification thought that maybe a scheme using a more uniform code as pk would avoid the performance penalty most ensure that the pk remains usable in form controls where necessary not require these conversions idea for a codification scheme would be along the lines of a 10 character code split digits for a digits for a unique client digits as a random number for potential digit would be in base composed of letters from and avoiding because of their similitude case we need to manually handle these for instance during to handle manually when the case require conversion between different representation since basically a string less existing code to assured in join been in insert should be faster than guid but not machine must be set its own although that should not be too much of an should i use guid or another scheme for my custom codification scheme instead of guid as primary

used git to stitch together my own github hosted project and an external ui library that i wanted to the library is hosted in a subversion repository on used and and it worked reasonably the downsides order to keep up to date with the library i had to perform a new commit to update the submodule git hash this is because git unlike are pinned to a particular commit this may not be an actual downside if you actually want to pin a stable i was working with code that was initial pull of a git repo with submodules requires an additional step with submodule this is not an issue for but for others using your code they will have to remember or be told to perform this step before your you use the command line it is easy to screw up your repository with this is because you type add to complete to add but it to add note the trailing if you execute the command with the trailing then it blitzes the submodule and adds all its contained files this is mitigated by using add or just training yourself to delete the slash happened to me enough times that i trained myself to remove commits can mess up git rebase i forget the exact but it is especially bad if you have a submodule and you run a normally with a dirty tree you but submodules are not having several submodule commits in a rebase group also causes the last submodule hash gets committed to the first pick on your and this is pretty tricky to fix this can be worked around with a more careful workflow carefully deciding when to do your submodule but can be a steps to set this up were something along the lines svn clone that as a git project to in your own git run submodule submodule add that out to your own repo this is more or you will have a new directory which in your case would be the geomapping time you need to update the geomapping you would run something svn svn push this updates the git mirror of the add subproject careful with the trailing commit push this pushes the commit that updates the not seen to many tutorials on a git submodule work so i hope this helps you	
used going to have to help git find the correct commit to perform the rebase going to guess but presumably you have an common commit which has two the head of your public branch and the place on your dev branch that this commit corresponds to call the public head commit and the dev commit that this corresponds to the dev branch checked you want to do something like rebase tells rebase to take the patches introduced by each commit since on the current branch and to apply these commits to i think that this is what you update to the question shows that h is equivalent to the head of the public stream on the dev branch and that you want to transplant everything from here onwards on the dev branch onto the public if so the command rebase pub

users now want to put strings the value field as well from a list and wondering what the best way of that would sounds like the users want to add new if that is the case why not just add them to your existing testcode table and keep your existing it be bad practice to the field over to a string and store both strings and integers the same there are issues related to this one but sure if any are a really big not a big often po numbers or invoice numbers have numbers or a combination of letters and you are right however about the performance of the database on a number field as opposed to a but if you index the string field you end up with the database doing scans on numeric indexes problems you may have had with your decimals as strings probably have to do with the floating point data types in which the server essentially estimates the value of the field and only retains accuracy to a certain number of this can lead to a whole host of rounding errors if you are concerned about the you can avoid that issue by using currency fields or the like that have static accuracy of the lol i learned this the hard did a great job addressing everything

using you have a lot of freedom to move memory i think that using a separate thread is probably not the best or way my guess is be better off using a type of incremental copying where on each or you compact forwards or backwards in some number of allocated with the number of bytes that you copy depleting a that is periodically reset to its initial value on each screen course only whole blocks are idea is that copying a given number of bytes takes a fairly predictable amount of so you can estimate how many bytes of copying you can safely perform per screen and limit yourself to if enough time in the a call to or will completely defragment otherwise it will defragment it as much as possible in the given the time are some questions leaving unresolved here exactly how to compact the a standard copying allocator can just start allocating from the then copy everything to the back up memory at the when memory runs but you have that freedom you might need some heuristics to decide whether to move blocks forward or the important thing is to avoid oscillations same block being moved forwards then backwards on successive calls to or

was thinking about some stuff lately and i was wondering what would be the right way to do something like the following scenario sure it is a quite common thing for db guys to do something like say you have a products something like this table not null default key key default out of the ordinary now lets say that there are a hierarchy of categories in a different and there is a separate table which binds relationships with products table so that each product belongs to some kind of a category omit because thats not the issue comes the interesting part what if each of the categories mandates additional set of variables to the product for example products in the computer monitors category must have enum screen size enum and some other lets say ice creams have some other variables like flavor shelf storage time int problem herein lies in that all products have a common set of variables description and sort of like but there are additional variables which are not consistent from category to category but all products should share common because in the end they all belong to the products so one can query for example select from products order by maybe not but you get the i see severa potential generate separate table for each product category and store products there with appropriate additional variables stupid and not query product table stays the same with common and for each category create a separate table with additional variables binding two tables with a join but query performance and clarity issues how would one filter down products from category table and additional filter for extra variable lcd monitors it would require sql join products table stays the same and add another variable type text that holds for example json data that hold additional variables compact and but filter through variables with know missing something quite obvious and simple here a bit rusty on the normalization techniques been searching around stackoverflow before asking this question without after posted the question i have clicked on one of my tags and found several similar questions which resulted in to look up specialization relational point of the story is that this must be the first occurrence in my internet life that tags are actually useful in i would still like to hear from you guys and your the problem with approach is that i expect somewhere around there is a hierarchy level of categories and end nodes add specialized variables they accumulate in the order of so it would be a bit unpractical to add specialized tables to join due to the vast number of attribute volatility in my case attribute that was suggested looks like the way to here comes query thanks would you model data variables variance on common	
was thinking about this the other day and wanted to see what the so community had to say about the it stands right now common lisp is getting some attention as a web development and with good reason which sure you are already was wondering how one would go about using a library in a shared environment in a similar fashion to i set up something like sbcl as an interperter to interpret fasl files like python or what would be the best way to use libraries for come as asdf installable but it would be a stupid amount of overhead to require and install the library each and every time a request is in mind this is for shared would it be best to install system wide copies of the libraries for use in reduces but there may be problems with using the correct version of the allow users a control to install local copies for more no version tell them to wrap it into a module and load it on demand like python does not sure this can be done with just being able to load a library for use would be the best but i think a lot of them are designed to be used this looking to hear your the best way to use libraries in a shared hosting

was wondering if it was a common practice to salt and hash a password like is concatenation and e uses rsa for primarily asking this question for transport of a password database online storage where the server would have the private key to decrypt the encrypted password at all know that a cryptographic hash should be but an brute force attack on weak passwords would easily reveal a to eventually decrypt a record in this the server will know the length of padding and simply take away padding to reveal is not a typical but i find a reference as to someone having to properly transport a password database and defend against an should one defend against an brute force password	
was wondering whether using a and braces approach to programming and to data validation in particular was good practice or this came about from the following was creating a form and i added listeners to all the fields which should mean that the button is only enabled if all the fields in the form have valid i was then writing the code which was run when the button is pessimistic side of me decided that belt and braces never hurt anyone and it hurt to validate the form again in case a bug in my form then i know what to put in if the validation if i do something like i have to create code to display an error message which should never be anyone maintaining this code in future is then going to worry about and possibly be confused by this in theory needless the last thing i want is someone wondering why this particular dialog is never option at the other end of the scale throw new should never i feel dirty even typing that but perhaps a good reason to use it which i have finally i ended up the downside of that is that not really belt and braces since the braces there at so if there is a bug in the code my trousers are still going to fall down as it maybe i have the extra validation at but still a part of me which thinks it be interested to hear what you do in similar the question is asking what is the best way to ensure the form returns valid assume that the output of the form is validated again before it ends up in the database and so belt and braces programming good practice or just introducing needless

way applets work in netbeans is annoying to the suggested usage from the help is to run the applet as you indicate you did netbeans will produce an html file under that references the you then copy the html file to src where your class you can then tweak the html and in subsequent runs netbeans will use your html file instead of generating every time you run the file netbeans opens the applet viewer program that ships with you cannot control any of the arguments passed to the applet it ignores the parameters you configure in the to change the parameters passed to the applet you must edit the html file better way is to use the appletwindow classes created over at the bluej it lets you host an applet on a which means you can make a small standalone swing app which calls your the program then has a main you can launch an extra swing window with buttons and text controls to simulate javascript calls to the applet and you can tweak the attributes that get passed to the applet at very nice for trying out new things in your this jar contains the compiled files and the info about bluej and other

way round it is to redirect the post to a page which redirects to a get see on your post is 4k of form presumably your server does something with that data rather than just displaying it once and throwing it such as saving it in a keep doing or if a huge search form create a temporary copy of it in a database that gets purged after a few days or on a lru basis when a space limit is now create a representation of the data which can be accessed using if generate an id for it and use that as the if a permanent set of data it probably has an id or something that can be used for the at the worst an algorithm like tiny url uses can collapse a big url to a much smaller redirect the post to get the representation of the a historical this technique was practice in

whole reason to have accessors and modifiers is to provide yourself with an extra level of extra level of indirection allows you to provide a read only view of your variable to a public while not allowing your data member to be you could still use a private or protected allow you to do special error validation and corrections when a value is for example you could make sure there is a terminating slash if the user specify this ensures that your class state will always be can also shield your members from having them exposed to allow pointers to by not allowing pointers to them from the you can ensure that if your object goes out of scope it lead to a extra level of indirection for also allow you to be able to change the data member that they a getter you can also obtain different views of your when your data member is actually stored in is not the reason to use but a nice side effect of using getters and setters is that you can set a breakpoint inside your modifier for example to see exactly when it is you should use them or not is a judgement call based on your if you have so many members that it is a huge pain to provide getters and settings you could consider storing the data members in a struct and using that struct inside your class you could even provide for an object for the whole struct at

will get unless i just run out of a few comments about the answer that references are two types of color interpolation that is some years trilinear interpolation product linear was a common approach for color table trilinear interpolation can indeed be implemented as a sequential set of one dimensional first on one then then along a second years ago we all realized that trilinear interpolation introduces artifacts in color when applied to certain types of the problems are seen in a solution is to move to a simplicial in by dissecting a cube into 6 in n the unit cube will be dissected into there are other dissections of a but this particular style assures that the main diagonal is always a shared edge for all the this in turn restores good behavior for when applied to certain color lookup let me get into the question of true scattered data have mentioned a variety of distance based methods are a i did some work in the past with these i actually preferred the inverse multiquadric all of these are really just variations of radial basis function a common rbf methods have their good and bad they will usually generate a smooth this of course depends on the specific basis function as well as whether you choose to limit the rbf methods also allow you to at least as far out as the support of the radial basis elements will if the basis elements are allowed to be infinite in then no explicit constraint on extrapolation will in general is a bad thing to one problem with rbf methods is they require the solution of large systems of linear and those equation systems are often dense this means the size of the in terms of the number of data points you can handle tends to be limited by the linear if you limit the support by truncating the basis then the matrices can become this will improve the linear algebra if you use a sparse matrix package for the at the same the support distance becomes a nonlinear parameter that you must as methods like multiquadrics and inverse multiquadric methods may have a secondary nonlinear parameter that controls the shape of the basis kriging has similar and lump all of these methods to these all of these methods that classed as rbf variants are often limited in the number of points they will comfortably depending upon how you deal with things and the amount of memory that limit might often be on the order of a few thousand other problem with the general class of rbf methods is what call this is a neologism i created many years ago to describe interpolation across a relatively large hole in the in there may often be problems even when interpolating across smaller holes in the these because they are smooth to some may introduce unwanted extrema peaks or into the interpolated this is a common problem with even often seen as ringing artifacts with cubic spline or polynomial and certainly seen with fourier series the problem in higher dimensions is to even recognize that it has indeed since plotting surfaces in more than three dimensions tends to be you have more points than that or if these ringing artifacts are then other methods are often a better if you are willing to use a linear then the simplest solution in higher dimensions is to start with a tessellation of the thus in 3 tessellate the data a delaunay into this is fairly efficient to and there are many tools to be found for this it is then a simple problem to interpolate any individual merely identify which simplex the point lies compute barycentric coordinates as interpolation weights within the and form the corresponding linear combination of the function values at each vertex of the found this is all extremely fast and downside of these tessellation based methods is they typically restrict you to the convex hull of the data and as if your data happens to lie in a then the interpolant may well do strange things in some regions of your another problem with the scheme i mentioned is the interpolant will only be piecewise but once you move into higher dimensions things get nasty other methods are to be found for smooth interpolation based on a but they will take more effort and are therefore far less basic tradeoffs should be obvious if you need a smooth interpolant and only have a few then rbf methods are often they are easy to the actual method chosen is often just a matter of or even used one tool before and was probably be happy with it since the question was which method is for practical point out that best is a very subjective word when applied out of what are your goals in an interpolation what skill set do you what set of tools do you know how to what environment will you work all of these factors will influence your choice of the best you have many data and speed is of the but ultimate smoothness is not that then you will generally look for a simplicial of if you have sufficient then the piecewise linear nature of the beast is of less the piecewise linear interpolant here has the great virtue in some cases that it can never generate extrema in your surface that did not exist in the for some color characterization for this is of paramount other issue is with while the presence of noise is often a signal that smoothing of some sort is not all such surfaces have smoothing any smoothing operator will sometimes smooth out important features of the data this happens because we can think of a smoothing operator as a low pass high frequency behavior is often but it may also be just a sharp toe or shoulder in my surface that i cannot afford to if this is a then you may be willing to use an interpolant even in the presence of sometimes significant in that suggest that the lowest order interpolant is a more global interpolant will also tend to amplify any noise in the so if you look for the lowest variance interpolant in the presence of it will generally be a linear there are many varieties of thin plate interpolatory or once you go beyond one your options also at least if you are willing to do the end here before it turns into a

wise i think there are a couple of ways you could improve your first is that your script is dependent upon the name of the script not while i think likely change the name of this you never know what mood be in a few years from instead why not just calculate the name of the script next problem is that i believe split function will fail if you ever place the directory in a path which contains a it will cause a path like to appear as much better to remove the split and just use the enumeration by the you are taking a dependency on the current path being the path containing the you should either make that an explicit parameter or use the path containing the file prefer the is the updated version i would gci in a security standpoint you have to consider the possibility that a malicious user adds a bad script into the target if they did so it would be executed with your file and could do damage to the but at the point the malicious user has access to your file likely they could do the damage without the help of your script so probably a minor

with problem is that io in haskell is the block beginning with is a syntactic sugar for combining monadic expressions called with monadic in this the monad in question is the io as can be inferred from the call to the in the second line of the block is actually the of the whole do it is interpreted as the last argument of not that it accepts a second but the compiler even get to the point of figuring this because it terminates earlier with the type error you to make that line a have to another monadic in front of it not that this would help you to solve your type error stems from the fact that io monadic expressions always have the type in your the block has this type as which is obviously incompatible with the type you specified in the because haskell is a pure functional language with monadic once inside the io there is no way out of it is if a function has a block with io operations in its signature will necessarily contain the and so will the signature of all other functions invoking this monads do provide but the io monad does

work primarily in the world and the standard model there is for developers to work in a user account with the ability or to escalate to admin privileges not sure what the equivalent windows arrangement would but this in my the ideal the one having admin rights available on demand gives the developer full power over his workstation when the windows software has a long history of assuming that all users have admin to the point that many programs run for a many of security issues stem directly from this implicit requirement in order to be able to reliably use the all users must be must and the most effective way to ensure that your software will run for users is for your developers to be running it themselves as

working a site where users could technically stay logged in as long as they never close their browser therefore never get a new session what i could see a user leaves a browser open on computer the then use computer login and change their name which is stored in the they logout of but a is still logged in and still has their old name stored in the their name be updated till the next time they logout manually or they close their browser and open it again and are logged in through the remember me is a simple but in my case the subscription level of their account is stored in the session and can be do you deal with few ideas that i have a period of 10 minutes or the session data it might be exactly 10 minutes if the user is highly active as the function will get triggered right at the 10 minute point or it could be after 2 hours if the user leaves and comes back and then triggers the as little information as possible in the session and load the rest from the db on every page really like this database sessions and use the same session on all the i like but i could see it getting confusing when something like search criteria are stored in the same criteria would show up on both even such as the name or store it in the but for other information that would heavily affect their abilities on the store it in the session and load when needed to only do it once per there other better use database session and when an update is made load the other sessions change the relevant information and save them back to the is the best way to deal with sessions when the user may stay logged but a session key needs to be because of another

working on tracking down some difficult to find memory leaks in my iphone running a quick test on an app which leaks an nsstring object with the following intentionally nsmutablestring uncomment the following line to release string and clean up your test running leaks on the process id of the i come up with the leaks 9988 nodes malloced for 1260 3 leaks for 128 total leaked 0x163b50 instance of type implemented in foundation 0xa07e0720 0x01001080 0x0000000a 0x00000010 0x0000000a 0x0000000c 0x0000000b 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000015 0xa1b1c1d3 0x00163b90 0x00163bd0 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x178190 string 0x178210 instance of type implemented in corefoundation 0xa02e24a0 0x010007ad 0x00178190 0x00000013 0x00000020 0x00000200 0x00000000 0x00000000 we all know where the leak not the point of this for me at trying to recognize how to make sense of this being told that there are 3 objects which are located at the memory addresses their implementation is in apple not my code according to in a trivial example such as the finding the leak in an application with 500k lines of i find the output from leaks here am i doing wrong and how can i make sense of this output to help me find the culprit in the code written to clean up my memory note that this thread advocate the usage of instruments or clang static cleaned up all memory leaks which clang static analyzer has reported to instruments is bloated and to getting a ton of reports for none of which the stack traces are showing go back to my own code although certain the are indeed in my like to figure out how to use the cmd line leaks tool even after uncommenting the lines to clean up the the utility complains even more than it did when there was is leaking that much from such a trivial this occurs after uncommenting the release for the test string leaks 9890 nodes malloced for 1255 7 leaks for 560 total leaked 0x163920 instance of type implemented in foundation 0xa07e2ae0 0x04f00000 0x0055002f 0x00650073 0x00730072 0x0073002f 0x002f0066 0x0069004c 0x00720062 0x00720061 0x002f0079 0x00700041 0x006c0070 0x00630069 0x00740061 0x006f0069 0x0020006e 0x00750053 0x00700070 0x0072006f 0x002f0074 0x00490053 0x0042004d 0x002f004c 0x006c0050 0x00670075 0x006e0069 0x002f0073 0x00650054 0x006d0072 0x006e0069 0x006c0061 0x163350 instance of type implemented in foundation 0xa07e2ae0 0x04a00000 0x0055002f 0x00650073 0x00730072 0x0073002f 0x002f0066 0x0069004c 0x00720062 0x00720061 0x002f0079 0x00700041 0x006c0070 0x00630069 0x00740061 0x006f0069 0x0020006e 0x00750053 0x00700070 0x0072006f 0x002f0074 0x00490053 0x0042004d 0x002f004c 0x006c0050 0x00670075 0x006e0069 0x002f0073 0x00650044 0x0069006c 0x00690063 0x0075006f 0x1635a0 instance of type implemented in foundation 0xa07e0720 0x01001080 0x0000000a 0x00000010 0x0000000a 0x0000000c 0x0000000b 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000015 0xa1b1c1d3 0x001635e0 0x00163620 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x163620 0xa02ed360 0x00160ee0 0x00163700 0xa02efc00 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00163680 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00163660 0xa02ed440 0xa02ec1a0 0xa02f0420 0x00000000 0x00163660 0x163680 instance of type implemented in corefoundation 0xa02e24a0 0x0100078c 0x6d6f6323 0x6c65642e 0x6f696369 0x61737375 0x69726166 0x6c65442e 0x6f696369 0x61537375 0x69726166 0x00000000 0x163660 instance of type implemented in corefoundation 0xa02e24a0 0x0200078c 0x6c65440f 0x6f696369 0x61537375 0x69726166 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x160ee0 instance of type implemented in corefoundation 0xa02e24a0 0x0100078c 0x362e3103 0x00000000 sense of the command line utility for finding memory

worth that especially v6 on pre sp1 and older windows has serious rendering issues when you intermingle tables within and divs within those once you exceed a certain complexity nesting you may get a your needing to text content in certain i would suggest adding an additional class declaration to the td not nesting a i would also suggest trying in and see if the issue you mention which versions you need to

would consider what everyone else uses not the folks on this but the folks who write the same kind of massively or super find they all write their code in just for this fact alone regardless of any speed issues between the i would go with the tools they use and have developed will be of much more use to you if writing in the same from found apps to have somewhat less than optimal performance in some multithreading is will try to keep you safe from thread problems a good thing in most but this will cause your specific case problems try writing a simple loop that accesses a shared object using lots of run that on a single core pc and you get better performance than if you run it on a multiple core box is adding its own locks to make sure you muck it used the static lock on took on my old on my superfast the lock version is even try it next point is that with c you tend to access memory and data directly nothing gets in the with you will use some of the many classes that are these will be good in the general but after the most efficient way to access this for your case is a big deal with of those classes were not designed with those datasets in they were designed for the common cases everyone else so you would be safer using c for this never get the gc getting clogged up by a class that creates new strings internally when you read a couple of terabytes of data if you write it in it may appear that can give you benefits over a native but i think find those benefits are only realised for the kind of applications that are commonly

would just use the mac address to generate a request then require users to register with your your client will have a special application that takes that request key and produces an activation key which the user can then use for activating the once the software just works no occasionally phoning home for verification and if it were a real my first task would be to try and convince the client that this was a bad reason is that these schemes practically prevent your code from being they do however make the lives of your genuine customers i find it hard to think of any other industry that goes out of its way to annoy its genuine customers with schemes that never achieve their goals than government of course you do just do a token effort to meet the contractual obligation tell your client this taking the mac address a random number the computer have a network as the request key and using a program to just it with an ascii string to get the activation seems like a workable i would also store both keys since you want the software to if they just change their network card even they still see that as the same computer and will not be happy if the software stops going to be cracked regardless the program is rubbish which sure is not the this method will give your genuine customers an avenue for moving their software to another machine if your company becomes unresponsive somehow goes out of and so main trouble with schemes that rely on the uniqueness of a bit of hardware is that the customer may choose to change that bit of their disk contents to a larger hard disk makes hd serial numbers cpu serial numbers means upgrading to the latest intel bigmutha cpu kill your the mac address means they change their can all be fixed by using those values to create a key at install time and only check against that not the changed value six months down the it means you have to store the request and activation values but upgrades will not require your users to go through the process of their believe they will despise you for having to do

would like to create a web are when a request would result in refreshing the content in or sometimes even more the cleanest way would be to run the requests one after the other in a sequence and handle the results one by i would like to have only one request if it is and collecting all the results for the there is a main container and some other containers simple way would main function from server for show it in m container some other content from server dedicated for show it in some other content from server dedicated for show it in some other content from server dedicated for show it in on the main function requested by the just some of the containers have to refresh not all of would like to minimise the number of actually minimise it to of it could be done by or would like to collect all the responses from the encapsulate them is content for content for and send it back to the where the client would unpack and regarding to the it would delegate each of them to the appropriate question that how would you do when you that the returned data is very in some cases it might contain even html double if i am not in some special cases this could screw up json and xml as idea was to divide the different contents by special separators now just for an easy example use and it is a very uggly but you cannot screw up the content for if the separators are unique previous solution would look like is content for content for on the client side split the code first by which would result in this case in two array elements what are going to be split again by the first element would give the the second one the content for after this the last step would be walking through the new and display the result in the appropriate there anybody who would suggest a nicer way for or who could show a safe way to do it in or for several

would like to populate a is what i have in db book you may know a treeview is made up of treenode treenode object have a text property and a tag property is the text that display on the screen for this node and the is an value uses to identify a in my the fields ending with id will be used in the property and the fields ending with name will be used in the for a i will use the bookid field for the property and bookname field for the i use a dbml so i have a book box object and chapter object and i use linq to get them from the my question what is the best practice to build this have a solution but really ugly because it looks like duplicating the problem is that the values i need to extract for the text and tag properties are identified by differents fields name in the for the book i need to get the bookid field to populate the tag property of my for the box i need to get the boxid field to populate the tag property can i make a kind of generic way to do it hope i made myself clear hesitate to ask me questions in practice treeview populating from differents kinds of

would not recommend done in the past for the exact same is create a scheduled task that runs ever n kicks off a small script that simply does these 2 checks for flag is read from the if the flag is then the script immediately stops end if the flag is the script kicks off a separate process in a new thread utilizes a service to perform a task that can be either very short or sometimes really depending on the amount of records to this process of course sets and resets the isalreadyrunning flag to ensure threads do not kick off actions that i have a service been running for years now with this approach and i never had any problems with my main process utilizes a web service and bunch of other things to perform some heavy backup	
would only be helpful if you had a of and wanted to call a method with an argument that was of things that are where t i think it helps suspect you are going to need a some set of objects that know how to feed a given type of and keep trying them until you find one that knows	
would overload the or operators if you were defining a specialized boolean this is not typically which is why they seem for in a boolean you might have something like represents a boolean that can store truth values in a range from a value of one indicating complete metaphysical certitude and a value zero indicating complete class fuzzyboolean public static bool operator return public static bool operator return that if you overload you must also overload vice there are also the and the two literal values you can assign to a boolean confuse these with the operators mentioned a more substantial example of how use involving booleans in a is given in the msdn docs	
would parse the rss feed of the quote website that it has and display the quotes that you should abe able to use native rss support to do check out an article on it	
would probable first look at having as a pointer instead i local vaiable to probable be then you dont use double storing of the variable as or whatever type i val if set the valur inside else if 2 set the valur inside else hint for optimizing your code could be to avoid using operator when you are not interested in the it depends on your compiler but this has proven way faster for me a macro for if is at least on most cases i have true that the profit is not so large when using modula calculations using only but if you ever are looning at a larger calue than 2 to do modula operation and are just interested in of the modula returns zero then my macro is faster in all the compilers i have

would probably have to use the property of triggered by can also use animations if you want the zoom effect to be option could be to place your inside a or use a i suggest you take a look at the i think supports berk berk	
would probably want to use to make widgets of those core animation is accelerated using but is much more suitable for animating many 2d layers and interacting with more standard widgets and events than the lower level quartz composer is good for doing certain kinds of decorative but its primary not building core animation also has the advantage that if you want to do lower level or integrate quartz composer you can put either of them into a calayer and so get the advantages of all of the see and for see a bit of what core animation can you should watch keynote introducing core	
would recommend changing that datatype to up to about 10 the might make sense since a tad faster and has less overhead but with 50 unless all the columns are fully used up to 50 this is a major especially since this column is also used in it to would possibly quite significantly reduce the space needed for the table on your amount of data and how much of the 50 chars are really and all the indices involved would also get a lot smaller plus you need this rtrim stuff anymore	
would recommend creating an implementation of and encapsulate the equality checking code in here is the link for the documentation on	
would recommend express application it will scale up to 4gb of user beyond you would have to start application express is very simple and build crud applications which is what is sounds like yours	
would recommend that you avoid using as this has been deprecated in python and removed in i know using but the reason has fallen into disfavour is that it is a very slow way to not sure why your effort with perhaps you forgot to use the function call versus just the function versus	
would recommend that you do as the warning suggests and use a stream rather than a byte if the response trying to push is particularly large a large you will load it all into and be a very bad really better off using you might hack around it by replacing or just and settable with the setout and seterr olderr newerr new do your agree that it would be preferable use but as it is target api where i need to put response is a byte we can do a refactor to api that will allow it to take that would be warning is definitely there for you can modify the do stream processing is the best way to go in this if you due to internal pressures or go route and pump up the but make sure you have a known or even that route will

would run a cursor mysql sp programming on this from group by on the returned rows from the just do whatever you need check for the check for and update each row on the you can open a different cursor from where name and firstname and lastname you will have a inner cursor with all the rows you will if it is the one you keep it and update it with the key value you delete you could accomplish what you want in one but i think that way get the same performance you would with this it santa santa

would save the height and width of the image in separate columns when you save the image to the database then when you do your select statement to read the image out of the you can also access the height and width fields from the you can access the height and width information when you load the image out of the database and then set the height and width properties before assigning the image to the picture	
would say applications that require very little latency between computation and representation as games or video other applications that require interfacing with local hardware are not well suited for online any answer you get will depend on the fact that your network connection is the keep in that when you are dealing with online most all of what you are doing is going to be pipelined through the network even frameworks that are offloading a lot of computation to the local cpu will still be pipelining the framework itself through the network if that connection is or then so is your	
would say do not initialize them it will be abundantly clear what is happening without would also say to not initialize local variables until you having a meaningful value for i often see code that resembles the following void someobject myobj if myobj else if myobj myobj null assignment is but i actually feel that it is damaging as if we forgot to assign to myobj in one of the code if we assigned to yourobj rather my myobj in the then we would end up with myobj set to null which would ultimately manifest as a null reference exception at some later point during without the inital null assignment then this would be a compile error much easier to deal

would say one very compelling scenario to use mvc is if you have a group of experienced developers who have experience with from that situation myself little web i found it i was much more productive and comfortable using mvc over found it very hard to pickup webforms due to the aforementioned abstraction think proof of webforms complexity is i have never met anyone who i would consider a webforms knows the page lifecycle off by binding mvc actually allowed me to use my and software experience without needing to heavily invest in learning the webforms not only that but i got a much better understanding of and this i think would allow higher quality mvc allows you to factor code much better than so i think developers with lots of experience will be more comfortable in	
would say that checking it n printage seemed to make more sense as that is fulfiling the contract for the you of replace the null checks with code to check at test but not at release	
would say that it depend on whether you store less or more it depends on how often you are requesting the stored databasemanagers are superb on caching so they are often the better choice performance how if you need a dynamic web page and are just loading static data maybe a text file is the better which format the data is stored in matter operations that are performance developing web i always use a rdbms as the primary data if the web application need to serve dynamic data at every i simply apply a cache functionality storing the data in a cache file that gets requested when no new data have been added to the primary data source	
would say that it depends on what it was but in general i am always in favor of having the fewest if you write it as a console service and use the task scheduler then you have two places to maintain going you write it as a windows service then you only have one fewer places to check in case something goes	
would say that you should have those core jars available in the classpath of the script on i see why want to repeatedly fetch those jars and put them somewhere again and those jars in directory as part of your core add them to classpath in the and be done with it would be my

would say there are not basically 3 tiers in the web services services is essentially soa oriented which can imply a it refers to distributed computing and could be scaled up to a massive system with hundreds of would agree with you that getting your data from a service as compared to a could be similar to getting data from other data sourced like and that this could be conceived of as an additional function of the data access course it also depends on often refers to discreet parts of the overall system data other tiers such as integration with web while often refers to the vertical layers in the code such as business data	
would seem that regular expression questions are common as each question seems to apply to a specific with that here is my specific need to validate that an employee id is in one of two specific the first format one that i have working is the where can be any alphabet character and can be any number between 0 and the other requirement for this is that only the first two positions of the employee id are meaning that a user can enter and it would validate employee id gets used in a sql like like this i have by second format is the one giving me the same requirement holds above where only the first two positions of the input string are anything else is but if entered it must adhere to the specified the format is the the part i am having trouble with is making sure that if more than two digits are that the next three to six values entered are and if the last value is then it must be a so valid inputs could or or or or or but not or or or or here is what i have so far for this problem is that this allows to be entered anywhere in positions three through it will not allow any in the first two positions and it will not allow any numeric characters in the seventh position its just those optional third through sixth characters allowing that is causing me hope this is enough info perhaps not too any help would be greatly thank expression validation in	
would send all in one big chunk as the underlying layers in therefor you dont have to worry about how big chunks you are sending as the layers will split these up as	
would separate the two using javascript or something like that could get to be a the problem with separating the forms is you have to do it in a way where you lose your original meaning if you have other form information around the file upload you might have a bit of a nightmare on your hands but if you can put the file upload either above or below the form that submit controls then use this method on one of my sites and it works quite	
would spend some time on first before learning mvc is based on some things from traditional be used with the mvc model and aspx but it is a good thing to still understand if you want to focus on first learn but do not spend time studying the common controls or rest of is still useful the the membership when doing and say likely a prerequisite to really using mvc there is a lot more work for out there than some employers are looking for people who know but they are mainly doing that as they are looking for people who are passionate about learning new my concern with mvc is that i see how to integrate it with traditional the reality is most jobs out there involve working with an existing not starting from

would sugest using regular at first i would split into sections with the following split each section into match the three possible subsection you must analyze range type it is a matter of parsing the extracted strings into numbers and adding them into putted everything together into a small console application that does the it is far from perfect no error no just parsing a demo i merged some of the expressions mentioned before to get the code compacter and probably class static void string input match sections foreach section in match subsections foreach subsection in match subsectionparts if decimal start decimal end decimal step if end if step decimal current while current to allow things like using decimal instead of single or numbers in the input are decimal numbers and cannot be represented by single or double because they use a base 2 so for represented by the single value x i i x programm will print after only 8 after 1000 iterations the error grows to displaying instead of and after one million iterations the result is instead of are no such errors for because decimal uses a base 10 representation and is able to exactly represent decimal numbers like	
would suggest that what you really want to do is use the model rather than arbitrary viewdata elements and override onactionexecuted rather than that way you simply replace the result with your jsonresult before it gets executed and thus rendered to the class jsonattribute public override void actionexecutedcontext var result new actionresult is my return	
would suggest using 16 digit identifiers that when printed or shown to customers are formatted in the format of but stored as numbers without the dashes in your reason for using this format is that it makes it easier for people reading out the number over to phone to read as they can do it in batches of 4 rather then trying to remember how much they have said you wish the first 4 digits can be used to identify the type of 1000 for 2000 for 3000 for 4000 for invoices second set can then by a identifier if you wish to keep that sort of information encoded in the number using a format of yymm so would be a customer entered in march then leaves you with 8 digits for the actual data would consider the use of letters in the identifiers to be a very bad idea for any system that deals with telephones as the differences in accents and understand is so varied that people are bound to get upset at trying to get their identifier recognised by someone who cannot understand their accent	
would suggest using a and setting the property to or as the axis will then do all the hard work of grouping your data your particular when the user makes a choice from the combo you should have a handler that computes how granular to make the based on the date	
would suggest using a pivot put the dates into the row area and records in the data nothing in the columns pivot table will be more dynamic than a formula solution because it will only show you dates that	
would suggest using entirely different config files for each staging in our depending on the build you would just use the required no less has example on how to do this in visual studio and if you read the first comment phil hack has got it working with if you are using vs 2010 you can now use	
would suggest using the associative array to pass named but keep them in the array without extracting echo a couple of reasons for looking at that you can quite clearly see that referring to one of the arguments passed into the if you extract and notice the you the next will be there scratching your head wondering where this variable came even if you know extracting the arguments to local still a guessing game to a certain it ensures that other code overwrite the you may have written your function expecting only to have arguments named and so in your other you define for later you might want to expand your function to take a new parameter called but forget to change your other so no matter what gets passed in the will always be set to are some benefits to using the array too apply equally to the methods of extracting or leaving in the you can set up a variable at the top of each function called myfunc overwrite all the defaults with the you here if you echo john could even remove all items from which have a corresponding this way you know exactly which variables you	
would suggest you take a look at this on the xna especially the first post and the posts starting without seeing the rest of the code working on i say for sure that this is the problem you are experiencing so have to look it as the post enabling multisampling might not be causing the problem	
would take the opposite and pull the middle out like	
would teach tham how to set ulimit so that core files can be i might also include information on basic signal numbers and what those might you might in addition give them an overview of ftp to move files off to where they are more comfortable as well the basics of cr lf i would explain to them the primary differences between unix and windows slashes are i would also consider setting up a samba share so that they can use the tools of their choice to edit them how to redirect output and how to use tee is probably something they might benefit the basics of file permissions is a explaining that ssh and telnet are available to access those remote boxes might help if telnet port is finally i would teach them that removing a file has no undo feature as windows might consider explaining ps as well as simple pipes and i would show them how to background processes and maybe kill process with kill tools such as and pstree might help them	
would there be a performance they perform the same functionality as c the only difference is that they catch more errors at and easier to search for in your source is exactly equivalent to and will generate exactly the same a f is exactly equivalent to and will generate exactly the same so the only cast that differs is can throw an but that is because it does things that the cast cannot so use unless you need its is usually safe to assume that compiler writers are given two different expressions that have the same semantics according to the it is usually safe to assume that they will be implemented identically in the the second example should be not of fixed it just to make it absolutely here is what the standard conversions performed by followed by a followed by a be performed using the notation of explicit type the same semantic restrictions behaviors if a conversion be interpreted in more than one of ways listed the that appears first in the list even if a cast resulting that interpretation is if since the cast is implemented in terms of the casts should be course they because the compiler generates the same code in any but more plausible than the casts being

would use a to get the values of the function into the and then the ranking like over by as as inner join on where is null or like and is null or group as you wanted only a certain section of results for then you would need another and then filter on the row over by as as inner join on where is null or like and is null or group as as between 1 and that in this you could put anywhere in the select since you are no longer reliant on using the by syntax for the order by is a subtle issue here when calling this query multiple it is not guaranteed that the order in which the records are returned are going to be consistent if the number of items in each group is not in order to address you have to change the function to order on the fields that make up the group in the this it would be a and resulting over by as as inner join on where is null or like and is null or group as as between 1 and ends up ordering the results consistently between calls when the count of the items between groups is not unique the same set of	
would use a variant of the i would extend the command pattern to make a iintervalcommand it would have a interval and a readonly canexecute property in addition to the execute you create a commandlist class that holds a list of it would have a method called checktoexecute that you pass it the current game the checktoexecute method would traverse the list calling canexecute for each canexecute will return true if the elapsed time has if canexecute return true then checktoexecute will call the execute method of the object implementing adding additional game events is a matter of creating a new class implementing instantiating the object and adding it to the the processing of the event is time consuming then the command could spawn the processing as a separate it will return false to canexecute property until the thread returns even if the interval has passed or you have it spawn off another thread if the interval passed avoid the giant case you could eliminate the database and setup the parameters when you instantiate the or keep it and use it as part of a factory that creates all your

would validate the form on the client if the age is 0 then let the user know that not a valid on the server change the yield return new years is not a valid know that because you bind to a model property from your entity it gets 0 as the default value why you change that in the database set a default in the database to a value that you consider reasonable for the user so that it no longer displays as 0 for new you want to change the db use jquery to set the textbox values to empty strings on your create page when it if the user tries to submit such a form you can check on the client to disallow it and on the server you have to do the user will get a value is message the you can not compare it with 0 because someone insert a value 0 then it be considered as see a problem in this particular domain do you think that age of 0 is a good value or ask	
would venture to say that there are many shades of gray between having an domain and cramming all of your services into your domain and quite at least in business domains and in my an object might actually be nothing more than just the for whenever the operations that can be performed on that particular object depend on multitude of other objects and some localized say an address for my review of the literature on the i have found a lot of vague ideas and but i was not unable to find a example of where the boundaries between methods and operations should how to implement that with current technology so for the purpose of this i will make up a small example to illustrate my the example of orders and an domain model would look something order long date long user which received the class orderitem long order to which this item long product bigdecimal bigdecimal my the point of the design is to use classes to better model the relationships between an model would look something order long date user orderitem order product bigdecimal bigdecimal you would be using an orm solution to do the mapping in this you would be able to write a method such as that would sum up all the for each order the model would be in a sense that operations that make sense from a business like would be placed in an domain at least in my design does not mean that the should know about your persistence that should be done in a separate and independent persistence operations are not part of the business they are the part of the even in this simple there are many pitfalls to should the entire be loaded with each if there is a huge number of order and you need a summary report for a huge number of would you be using loading objects in memory and invoking on each or is an sql query a much better from every that is why a decent orm solution like offers mechanisms for solving precisely these kind of practical with proxies for the former and hql for the what good would be a theoretically sound model if report generation takes the entire issue is quite much more that able to write or consider in one and not speaking from a position of but everyday practice in deploying business get something out of this feel free to provide some additional details and examples of what dealing regarding the and the example of sending an email after the total has been i would make a distinction fact that an email should be sent after price part of an order should be could also email actual method of sending an one has to is sending of an email an inherent ability of an or yet another thing that can be done with like persisting serialization to different formats i would and what i consider a good oop approach is the define an interface encapsulating operations of preparing and sending an interface emailsender public void public void recipienttype public void public void inside define an operation by which an order how to send itself as an using an email order public void total you should have a facade towards your application a point where the actual response to user action in my this is where you should obtain spring the actual implementations of this for be the spring mvc class orderemailcontroller extends baseformcontroller injected by private ordermanager private emailsender actual sending of modelandview httpservletresponse string id order order return new what you get with this objects contain they objects are decoupled from actual service implementation sending in separate thread by the nature of the interface interfaces are but know about any actual domain for if order gets an extra you need change only the can mock services and test domain objects can test actual services implementations know if this is by standards of certain but it a approach that works reasonably well in

writing a calendar application that needs to check for recurring each entry object has a returns an array of ranges each range contains the start and of each future need to check for conflicts between new and existing this by checking that none of the future occurrences of the clash with future occurrences of existing conflicts do do finish conflicts 1 if conflicts defaults to returning all occurrences between start start time 1 problem is this method is not very comparing just two each with a daily recurrence over 1 leads to 365 365 comparisons my machine that takes there may be any number of existing entries to compare a new entry to method i have now is have a computer science or maths background but various textbooks on algorithms and i been able to find to optimize the does anyone else have any conflicts in recurring

writing a game development ide that creates and compiles projects been working on for the past few and am in the process of updating it to generate output not only for but also for thrillingly simple process for but still requiring some part of i have found it necessary to start generating an file as part of this to map dependent dll names to linux dependency names with confused about responsible for copying the file to the output name in a visual studio the build action for seems to normally be set to and its settings indicate that it be copied yet when visual studio compiles the project it generates sometimes found this to be when i use msbuild to build a solution file generated by the ide debugging msbuild copies to but when i compile the project with it like the config file being included as source code error a namespace does not directly contain members such as fields or and of course it copy it to the output when i include it as an is it my responsibility to simply copy to or is there a more standard way of doing it hardwired to take the first in my ide conceivable that the file would be renamed or another one added as in visual it seems odd to me that the ide has this secret action for config files think monodevelop behaves similarly in this regard because i find a special action for config files there i know how it even picks to what files this secret action copies to	
writing a game that involves clicking links on various sites on the i know it sounds strange but the basic premise is that you start on my page where you click a link to some page on another you continue to follow links until you get to the page you are trying to think the difference being that i have control over the actual pages with the i need to be able to do is track all the links that they and when they get to the final i want to send them back to my site something along those i was thinking was that perhaps i could somehow intercept the page requests and inject some javascript to track which links they is this has anyone done anything like obviously this could pose a security do i have any other i want to avoid making the user collect a list of all the links and then post them into a textbox on my javascript into a

writing a java application which needs to perform an unusual login one of my problems is that the user needs to supply more than a simple a combination is problem is that my application enforces some password lifetime rules a password becomes invalid after 90 the authentication server that i use will refuse authentication when a password is expired and forces the user to choose a new therefore my login process must be able to handle the standard servlet does not allow me to do any of is there any way to create a custom and safe login procedure for a java web the problem with supplying the domain can be worked around by having users enter instead of just username in the field and then let a custom realm decode this is however a bit kludgy and solve the second problem login procedure in a java web	
writing a java library that will be used by an existing using dependency injection so testing is and familiar with spring so i was planning to use it to manage the dependency injection while the applications that will eventually use the library are not nor does it use any container of any sort my question the best approach for injecting dependencies if spring or guice are not should i consider something like a factory method to instantiate and wire the the dependencies are all inside the so it seem appropriate to have the application instantiate each dependency to create the main dependency injection in a

writing a plugin to highlight text strings automatically as you visit a web like the highlight search results but automatic and for many it could be used for people with allergies to make words really stand for when they browse a food i have when i try to close an fresh ff it somehow blocks the whole when i kill the all the windows but the firefox process stays alive pid is listen to any has lots of resources still eats but two is it even possible for a process not to listen to kill as user nor as there anything i can do but a this is the offending pid vsz rss tty stat start time 16688 784476 345464 d mar28 with grep pid ppid c stime tty time 16688 1 4 mar28 the only process as you can not a it listen to kill no matter if i kill by pid or if i try to connect with then the also hangs and be there is no my guess is that ff hangs in some kernel routine but based on feedback by show you in which kernel routine a process in my the offending plugin was the beagle indexer after disabling the ff was a quick and happy fox is it possible that kill for a process on linux has no	
writing a simple custom control and banging my head against the wall trying to figure out how to implement what seems like a my custom is supposed to work similarly to the list in windows that it displays a list of items as but when the user selects an item in the a clickable button should appear next to the item in my trying to display an button next to each item in my order to keep the custom somewhat trying to display the button by overriding the method the button is conceptually part of the list box but i get it to work quite should note that trying to use a single button for the entire when the user selects a item in the the method just this single button so that it appears next to the selected i have it the problem now is that when the is scrolled and the selected item goes the button is still drawn to its previous so it draws on top of the wrong guessing this is because windows try to redraw the selected item if it is and thus the repositioning code get is version of what i have right partial class eventlistbox private button public set up the button that will appear next to the new add the button as a child control of this protected override void if draw item here if drawing the selected the button so that inside the current and make it visible if it is these checks prevent the resulting repaint that will occur from causing an infinite the problem seems to be that if the listbox is scrolled such that the selected moves this code because it repaint the selected item this means the button will be painted in its previous the real question is there a better way to approach the whole notion rendering buttons within listbox if protected override void for for using a single would rather create a separate button for each item in the but i find any way to track when items are from the i find any relevant methods that i could and i the property to a custom collection since is because of i went with the above approach of using a single button and it as but as i this very robust and breaks current thinking is it would make the most sense to create a new button at the point when new items are added to the and remove buttons when items were are some possible solutions i came up but is there a better way to implement could just create my own methods directly derived i could create a each time a new item is remove the button to this ugly because it forces me these special of just could draw a new button manually in using but then i have to do a lot of extra work to make it act like a real since is doing nothing more than drawing the figuring out when the user hovers over this and when it is seems like it would be difficult to get is i could create a new button if the item being drawn already have a button associated with it could keep track of this with a but i still need a way to remove unused buttons when their corresponding items are removed from the i guess i could iterate over my dictionary of mappings and remove items that exist in the but then iterating over two lists every time an item in the is redrawn is there a better way to include clickable buttons inside a obviously been done but i find anything useful on the only examples seen that have buttons in a were wpf but looking for how to do this with is the best way to draw controls as within each item in a winforms	
writing a small algorithm in php that goes through number of movies with and will store the top not reading from a but from a stream so i cannot simply order the movies by question is what is the most efficent way to keep track of the top 5 rated movies as i read the currently i do the in 5 movies an array called with two keys and the array by using rating now sits at in the next this new movie rating then replace with this new the until method but requires a sort on the list after every i believe this to be an expensive method mostly due to the fact that every time i use i must do a for loop on 5 movies just to build the index to sort can anyone suggest a better way to approach top 5 values in php

wrong with the boost but the developer guidelines are a bit to relaxed once a library is in the developer can change he wants behavior and happened to me with where parts of the interface and just changed or simply dissapeared even a notice in the change similar thing happened with behavior recently the behavior was never precisely official answer is that you should view each boost version as a different the problem with that is that the bug fixes will almost never end up in the previous versions if the library versions quality of any boost library depends on the quality and dedication of and sometimes there are no being i still find some of the libraries genius and use then

you are a fortran programmer you have probably seen a subroutine accepting if you think about insane are too you run the risk of swapping and you quickly realize that some arguments always travel would make sense to pack them under a single entity that carries everything around as a non as independent this would reduce the number of arguments giving you only the burden to find proper this single entity is the your you say that a bank is an aggregate of those you can now declare a concrete variable of that which will represent and provide access to the single variables acchecks and so in order to do you have to use the so if your bank variable is called you can say for can imagine b as a containing different you move the all the shelves and their content move array is a group of entities of the same type or or and they are one after another so you can access each of them with a numeric remember unless specified arrays indexes in fortran start at 1 all the other major the first index is zero for your i suggest you integer is the but you write please also note that there is a difference between using the and the if you want to define a matrix which is a you have to use the what you wrote is the better if you write character this you write but your syntax is deprecated could be remember that better if you write one member variable per line in the a matter of but i prefer to see the full size of a type by having one line per member maxrows and i would write them as and parameters and stuff that is highly constant by tradition is identified with an all underscore separated name in any major to answer your here is an example of the use of an more integer myarray 0 equivalent to zeroing the single elements one by print g95 0 5 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 array is just like multiple variables with the same identified by an very useful to express or can of course do an array of an aggregated type you instead of a predefined type

you are describing is commonly known as and many source control systems have different ways of handling in the most common case derived objects are created during the integration of a new label in the build common other derived objects are compiled object archive files and database an example of source control system handling derived objects is ibm rational does not have good handling of derived objects i would suggest to create a make file for so before you run which all the relevant derived you can put a specific makefile into each directory and make them include makefiles from subdirectories so anytime you commit a just run a makefile in its directory and it will update dervied objects in the entire subtree that you you can add rules to the makefile to set derived objects as after they are makefile stategies see the gnu user make is a tool specifically designed to handle creation of derived objects based on source file modification and

you are going to do anything in regards writing or designing one of the things you should always is write a irrespective of whatever methodology you are wether it is agile or many people who say that writing specs is so unagile and a monument to wasteful bureaucratic the simple fact is that they are misguided when they say that code is the clear fact is that a spec allows you to formulate your ideas and designs and its much easier to change a spec than it is to change a especially if you are working outside the confines of simple lob specs ensure you have a clearer understanding of what is required when you start been show time and time again that teams that use design better my if you hear anybody say the code is the that is plain and and is storing up huge maintainability problems for the an i have anything against the agile manifesto or light management process centric methods like used it in the past few years a number of it also seen good software down the where an agile focus would have saved but it is no panacea or silver

you are starting to work with perl and have never done so this module will save you tons of time and for almost every basic error message you can this module will give you a lengthy explanation as to why your code is including some helpful hints as to how to fix for you this helpful symbol requires explicit package name at line of aborted due to compilation errors said strict which indicates that all must either be lexically scoped declared beforehand or explicitly qualified to say which package the global is in exception from user global symbol requires explicit package name at line of aborted due to compilation at line myname print some error get this helpful chunk of error at line near of aborted due to compilation errors probably means you had a syntax common reasons a keyword is a semicolon is a comma is an opening or closing parenthesis is an opening or closing brace is a closing quote is there will be another error message associated with the giving more it helps to turn on error message itself often tells you where it was in the line decided to give sometimes the actual error is several because perl is good at understanding random the line number may be and once in a blue only way to figure out triggering the error is to chopping away half the program each time to the error went sort of the cybernetic version of exception from user syntax error at line near of aborted due to compilation line there you can go about deducing what might be wrong with your program this print is formatted entirely a large number of known errors with while this would not be a good thing to use in it can serve as a great learning aid for those who are new to	
you are statically linking the then the other option is to write your own version of in an object the linker should prefer your version over the runtime thanks to jason coco for pointing out a major misunderstanding that i had in and its this one is a little easier to solve since the linker will prefer a version in an object you just need to write in terms of only difficulties are cleaning up the file descriptors that will return to you and making everything thread you could use a static array of descriptors and an function for cleanup if you can put a cap on how many temporary files you if just use a linked list

you create your first set a int timeout int maxtimeout if a read times out get you have to you could do something like assuming previously set the as shown and assuming that the heartbeat will always get a response from the remote long lastreadtime catch if up the server to reconnect to the else a heartbeat to the boolean return lastreadtime common way of handling this is setting the timeout to some number 10 and then keeping track of the last time you successfully read from the if times your timeout have then give up on the client and close the socket sending a fin packet to the other just in the heartbeat will get any response from the remote but is just a way of ultimately generating an ioexception earlier when the connection has fallen then you could do this that the sendheartbeat itself will not throw an if terminated with catch this just means our read timed out the socket is still a heartbeat to the catch terminated with exception void up the server to reconnect to the

you define a literal of the message compiler will treat the characters as constant and may well put them in it is advisable to use the const keyword so that any attempt to change the literal will be prevent the program from message guessing the reason const on a literal is not enforced as part of the language is just for backwards compatibility with versions of c where the const keyword anybody know any	
you define your macrodef following	
you delete a you have to do something about its there are no children no you just remove the there a left also no you remove the node and move its left child into its for the right just move the child into the place of the deleted problem comes when you want to delete a node which has both left and right you could move the left or the right child into the place of the deleted but what do you then do about the other child and its is you locate the logical successor to the node being by logical i mean say you have a tree made of integers and you delete node with value the logical successor the next largest if you were doing an it would be the element you come to after the element a simple rule to find the logical you go right one always have a because this is the case where you have two and then you go as far left as you element you end up at is the logical larger than the deleted element went right at the but the next largest that element always has only one or no children because you went left as far as you so you go left any more because there is no left so that element has no children or just a right child and that means it falls into one of the catagories children or just one so unlinking element is comes the cool bit consider if that next largest element were in the same place in the tree as the element you want to tree would still be valid and because everything to the left of each element is everything to the right is what you do is you copy the user data in the next largest node into the node being deleted and you delete next largest has no children or just a right so easy to unlink and basically find your logical unlink him from the tree and put his user data into the element actually originally deleting you then of because still physically part of the	
you describe often refers to the following you use a com server com object instantiated in a separate process rather then in the same process as your and for some reason that com server encounters a fatal error and terminates the com object you were using no longer since rpc is used for interacting with com servers and the server side no longer exists after termination you receive the error message saying that the rpc server is unavailable which is true but looks have to research and eliminate the reason of com server the most likely reasons are the unreasonable input values you pass to the calls unhandled exception in an event if you have any handling for events fired from a com component you should catch all the exceptions that may be thrown inside your handler and not let them propagate outside the

you have a table rules with 3 columns and as data enters the i want to know if any row of the rules table matches my data with the condition that if the corresponding column in the rules table is all data the obvious sql from or a is and or b is and or c is if i have a b 50 null 51 xyz 51 null null xyz input of will match rules 1 and is there a better way to do with only 3 fields this is no but the actual table will have 15 columns and i worry about how well that sql an alternative sql statement i came up with involved adding an extra column to the table with a count of how many fields are not in the this columns value for rules is 2 and 2 with this the select could from when a then 1 else 0 when b then 1 else 0 when c then 1 else 0 i have enough sample data to find our which of these approaches would perform before i start creating random i thought ask here whether there was a better data mining techniques and column constraints are not feasible the data must be checked as it enters the system and so it can be flagged the users control the addition or removal of rules so i convert the rules into column constraints or other data definition last in the end i need a list of all the rules that the data fails to the solution cannot abort at the first there a good way to check rules against n

you looking k in s for k in keywords more but might be less	
you looking see	
you loop an they are cached so it really do anything except waste after the first do you know that	
you make a change to the data model dbml the linq to sql classes are generated completely from any modifications you make to the class files will be the pluralization rules would have to be done by changing the code but i do not know if this is can change the generated name by the table in the dbml designer window and selecting there is a field called with which you should be able to define a custom this is not directly relevant to this particular but if you want to add modifications to the generated they are defined as partial so you could add methods to the classes by creating a separate partial	
you make different controllers for get and post i in my js requests be dealt with differently personally see js requests just like post or any other type of so if i have i simply create them in the user	
you may use the to change the of the say this is in a	
you mean explaining then i think the answers already been if you mean looking for potential problems then lint and its first stop in any code	
you mean its a jquery ui	
you mean like the options on not aware of any support for the closest not the would be to use a things directly it looks like other people have looked at this you might try the sample	
you mean something like i have never used	
you mean the ajax scripts these should go into your if you mean the actions invoked by these ajax they should be treated as any other actions of the respective to be completely you should be using a different format as return values for those	
you mean the close button on the top right of a you need to use the formclosing	
you mean the message passing the best approach is to write the output strings to a buffer and send them to the rank 0 this process should be used not for doing the real work but just for filtering and outputting the output the other ranks to do the real i think your above solution will work because i is local to each also want to use the messaging to stop the individual ranks they can since they will be unable to do their sorting work in the have each rank 1 through n do work and send strings to rank the strings could be of the form where n is the rank and s is the rank 0 could then filter out specific messages or write different messages to different then combine them once all the working ranks had shut	
you mean to match all the nodes following but come before the next i think you can use something like start of range end of range either just before the next a node or all the rest this for debugging only copy all nodes in the calculated range and your get left the attribute in to make the calculations	
you mean you have the sources plus the result of the build in the same repository is a good argument for a daily with versioned build scripts in a separate binary in the repository itself is not but sources result of build looks bad to you build several binaries and notice a build breakage then you end up with binaries from different and you are preparing yourself for some subtle bug for a separately versioned autobuild than just against the binaries	
you mean you wish to create a tsql script which generates a create or use the management tools in sql server management studio to generate a create the a simply matter of a and selecting script table as create to new query you want the whole database then right click the database and select generate and then follow the a matter of selecting all sorts of fun things out of the various system	
you measured and found a performance hit with the a or should be

you mind really low you can just bit copy the structs in and out by casting a pointer to the struct to and using to get the struct their is a way to a void buffer a this only works if the data has no like better than struct int int i forget the i forget the	
you mind using perl as part of your build and work pretty	
you mind you can use its	
you modified the code yet you could probably run the serialver tool of the and see what it i beleive that will get you what the calcululated seriversionuid is a brief article on	
you modified the sample in any way other than changing the database have you been able to save any entities from the sample if you remove the code and just save the developed this sample against so i would imagine there be any incompatibilities with sql this question would probably be better be suited to the fluent nhibernate as stack overflow great for these investigatory	
you more visual 2008 redistributable package make sure you have visual studio at at applications in visual studio navin navin	
you must also ensure that the default comment does not become a for you should validate that the defect number is valid for as well as actually the programmers will simply use the default comment as the only my it would be better to put the effort into validating the comment than into providing a tell the developers that their changes will be rejected unless the comments meet the requirements and document what is expected questioner challenges but does not answer the i really use so take what follows with a pinch of at karl book source development with i see a good way to do there are and files that all seem to specify programs that validate log and the editor is launched when the user specify ci i committed ci for a message in a but personally i always checkin with comments on the command line and would hate to have an editor launched for short of writing a wrapper for the command would be moderately i see a way in the book of doing what you you override the definition of cvseditor in a shell script wrapper for with a program that creates the default message in the given file and then launches and likewise done it would probably the hardest part is ensuring that the programmers use your script version of instead of the	
you need a single array represented by a single xml element containing the easiest way would probably be to use a to turn your data of any number of into a byte and then simply encode that and stick it in your xml i think of any other easy way of turning arbitrary arrays into byte	
you need is not pivoted query but a simple select with group by and an aggregate string concatenation but i remember the exact function in there is no aggregate concatenation function in tsql but since sql2005 you can write your own extension to implement such there is plenty of examples on google search tsql 2005 concatenation aggregate	
you need some kind of a primary key in the will be easier to remove duplicates and to track the of debugging if you have with actually create a hidden primary key for you if you do it so just do it yourself and make if visible and	
you need the ternary operator is i think that there are often better ways to express in the example you why not use a format string that will do exactly what you allowing you to simplify your code	
you need to account for the as perl it would with begin or a opening anything not in to avoid greedy with three closing brackets	
you need to add a small feature or bug fix like within the next 3 minutes and you have to fix a file you have some half developed code on say practical needs rule over pragmatic ideals on the	
you need to be clear what a service do you mean a single or multiple endpoints in the same you mean a single then but with a little an endpoint can only implement a single so what you need to do is combine all the interfaces you want to implement into a single interface imyinterface then implement them all inside your implementation what you cannot do is have multiple interfaces and multiple implementations magically merge into a single	
you need to do is put your combo box inside your header like	
you need to do it a a function version to get the property if it exists and return undefined otherwise var properties var obj while if obj obj return obj return essentially a version declared	
you need to make a as in find the bottom of the range by then count inserting or deleting a node is stbuton makes a good point that if you want to allow duplicates seems plausible for datestamped then you want a you do not need to make a sorted array vector or find the location of the start of the range by binary then count inserting or deleting is in the duplicates are performance of lookups is the same in both log where m is the size of the but the array uses less memory per and be faster to count through the because after the binary chop just forward sequential memory access rather than following both cases you can arrange for insertion at the end to be for the keep a record of the end element at the and you get an for the grow it exponentially and you get amortised this is useful if the changes you make are always or a new event with the current since time is a if using system time then of course have to to avoid accidents when the clock resets an sql and let the database optimise how it and bigtable structure is specifically designed to make queries by ensuring that the result of any query is always a consecutive sequence from a index	
you need to owner draw the not really that i have done that but i got any code ready to you will need to get the canvas and use the textout

you not run a debugger and set a breakpoint in the appserver two different debug sessions one to trap the templating engine call and one to trap the call in the should be able to trace the output from the appserver in the templating engine debugging it is not possible to run two debug sessions then create some test inputs for the appserver by capturing outputs from the templating engine and use a single debugger with your test appserver	
you only ever going to have to check for a column like or something like that be more that you could have and so forth more possible but if you choose to use a then the or prefix is a good in my opinion makes it quite clear a	
you only have 25mb of isolated storage if i remember correctly from some mix09 this limit is lower if your app is so there are limitations there	
you only install qt or also the visual studio which is a separate	
you only left out the closing bracket for the opening conditional comment tag ie ie stuff you may want to do the with either or just the	
you only need a display of the it might be easiest to use the with a	
you only need whole second then can be if you need use if you want to be able to control the values then you will need to define yourself a surrogate for most libraries are designed along the lines described in standard c and you can often provide a function called that behaves as you replacing the standard and more you can revise your code to call a function of your own perhaps called where for production work you can have call the real via an inline function in both c99 and but it can be your own version that schedules time to change as you need to alter your use of it simply converts whatever value you give it into a you want it to give answers just as it always

you possible they are trying to detect when wraps to zero goes and keep it pegged at the max value for whatever type or they may be trying to deal with a situation where is incremented in multiple threads either this is buggy they are trying to wrap to zero or one too many increments will cause the problem if they are trying to deal with being incremented not sure what problem really trying to solve or how they are trying to solve are the jon skeet it still sounds odd to me because unless offset is the latter expression may not get the latest value even worse than that even if is volatile nothing to serialize reading the new value of with another thread that may be incrementing so the very instant after the expression the value of any number of other threads may come along and increment it number of so at the expression is but using that technique can be harmful because you may end up using a value of that to the situation where using to track an array index or something given the name sounds like exactly what might be going when you atomically increment the array element at that index becomes yours to if you use the expression as in the you may suddenly be trampling on an array element that really belongs to another think of a legitimate reason to use offset i at best harmless but it could introduce hard to diagnose problems use to the comment by simon svensson that pointed to a google search for the usage in the it looks like this code usually comes from the output of a to it even uses this expression to increment local variables threading an in the cases where is a local this expression falls into the useless but mostly harmless variety will be a if the increment really more or less a very inefficient expression fact it appears to be the way the converter converts the expression to see actually this conversion is buggy for anyway because it returns the incremented value when it should return what the value was before really bad thing is that other people may look at that code and the way i need to use	
you probably should create separate subclasses for the different types of especially if they will have type specific like the automatically generating of track listings you even without by using separately named product classes you will make the code more readable and more logical when dealing with product type specific also might want to create a more specific database specific specific specific music have a size measured in inches and clothes have a

you really need 5 different often if you need convert constructors you also want a default other constructors all take just different combination of the same it might be a better idea to have just one constructor that takes all of the with an option for each parameter that indicates the desire to invoke some kind of default for that object string can be const string can be null const bool

you really willing to do dev work with no seems to me that would limit you to practically trivial after a very brief learning i think find the matlab integrated debugger to be fantastic a vs you insist on doing your best option is to compile your to be runnable stand that would require access to the that there is a significant difference between the compiler distributed with matlab versions up to and those distributed with matlab know the compiler version in the compiler generated that could be than edited and compiled from 7 the compiler did no or any code generation for that running a program today practically runs it on a virtual matlab machine called the which encompasses almost all matlab it is a massive one mcr installer weighted 130m last time i debate on this can still be found on but not important in the mcr approach seems closer to what you for me works perfectly on windows it launches matlab as a but that would deprive you both of a text editor a	
you reference the persistence unit with in the like

you referencing the compiled assemblies consider adding them to your solution and including them as project you do it this will work with assemblies that are used by multiple as since each solution can contain the of this leads to the inevitable challenge of knowing this change break any other which requires a fair amount of this problem is eased a bit by coding to interfaces abstract classes and treating any change in signature that be accomplished via an overload as a requiring regression on the other applications that use those	
you remember to quote your it should the latter the lack of quoting causes php to interpret the strings as then fail with an and assume that you intended to use string the periods will be interpreted as string concatenation and php will end up interpreting your command as equivalent to the this in what then make sure to turn php notice level and pay attention to while notice level errors may seem most of the time they may hint at actual logic issues in your

you review a so question url you will see that an id and a are passed to the questions what i find interesting is you can change the portion of the url without affecting the ability to route the request the only way i could think to pull this off is have a route that accepted an id and a and used a route constraint on the slug to ensure it followed a i had to use a constraint to ensure that having the two variables result in this route matching all does anyone have a better way to accomplish or any examples of more advanced routing realize the slug is for human and i would like to duplicate this feature in another what is the best way to accomplish route url with new parameter controller action id slug new slug new class slugconstraint public bool route string routevaluedictionary routedirection string value return overflow question

you say below have you added the tbr to the if not that would be the reason it be	
you say do you mean code or infrastructure argue the infrastructure services and rather than the gives the most benefit to and ease of the examples you give are in the standard libraries of most languages or are very also just going to assume version control is a since its so integral to all say the important infrastructure would be a this lets people write whatever code they check it and make sure it works with everyone most important would be these let people develop faster and establish standards for and as common libraries are used the importance of the continuous build since small changes in those can cause problem with common is they take a lot of effort to design well so worth reusing and it takes a long time to get them to that most will start as specific to a and then someone will hack it into their followed by some then copy and after years someone will audit the code and start merging them into a common a plan should be made for upgrading common libraries and how to have two versions of them at another hidden drawback is they allow faster development in the short but hinder development in the long as people become locked into older versions is more true of third party would be this means common tools to simplify checking and otherwise having to interact with the code in any things that automate marking bugs as resolved when you submit a or notify continuous builders that dependencies have or automatically running tests before you submit a making tests easy to would be which is a simple extension of build this means that an app is self this has two machine reuse is and more its incredibly easy for a developer to get started they need to install extra or change something in or set something in their environment it just builds and i can think if everything uses the same monitoring then people have to monitor common it also makes it easier to identify problems since all the data is in one grepping and groking logs is a having a centralized place where all logs get stored in a structured format makes it easy to search and find on a large this lets developers testers and releasers release without stepping on each	
you say in your sha1 is a hash not it is a function even if it is does not allow the password to be you want stronger hash functions that are already in look at the sha2 family also but implemented in the collision attacks on sha1 are not practically exploitable but you are right to be looking nist is currently running a selection process for sha3 in the light of these but this is a few years from completion and commercial sha2 on the other hand is an existing family of algorithms that are standardised by nist and are not subject to the attacks that have been successful against md5 and	
you say it builds fine through visual studio by do you mean on the same if so then it probably is the fact that your cruisecontrol service is running as a different and as has differnt paths and environment variables maybe it does not have permissions to access the file system these dependencies are if you mean it runs fine on a different then i would make sure that those dependencies actually there and that the user the service runs as has permissions to get to we have never encountered these so i am just trying to guess at a few potential setting up

you say you touch sound in your i doubt your code doing does it occur if you run any other what happens if you mute various channels in the mixer on knowing anything else venture a guess that it could be related to the fan on your graphics if your programs cause the fan to turn on and either close to your sound card or the power line crosses an audio it could cause some try moving any audio cables as far as possible from the fan and power cables and see what could also be picking up static from a number of other and i say necessarily if programs cause this as it could be or even certain frequencies of usage being picked up on an audio line like an you can also try to reduce the number of loops in your audio wires and see if it but no	
you saying you want to go to and then go but leave the url perhaps what you would want to do then is use partial views to implement that your base page would be what gets routed and then inside of that page you do your condition testing to bring up different partial done that in my application for viewing either a version of a grid or an editable it worked very	
you see anything special in the event vista if there a manifest problem you will see traces of it in the event it will tell you to use	
you see why taking have and for each replace is iterating through the and making a new not an exact as any token found is replaced with the new token but for each token reading newing up of and writing can we think of a better way of doing how about instead of iterating the string for each we instead walk it walking create an empty output we walk the source if we find a jump characters and write out the obfuscated otherwise proceed to the next turning the process inside doing the for loop on the long and at each point looking for a to make this want quick for the so we put them into some sort of associative array see why it is taking long but not sure on the for each string on which i have 1 to 2 tokans i want to so character by character looking for of a thousand tokens what takes longest in up when we create a what likely happens is that some amount of space is allocated 64 and that whenever we append more than its current it doubles its and then copies the old character buffer to the new possible we can can and not have to if we start with 64 to get up to we allocate and then then then then then 2048 we do this twenty times to get up to and in getting allocated just to throw it by using something analogous to will at least let us do that all at but still all at once for at least producing a temporary string for if you have 2000 allocating about a 2 billion bytes of all to end up with each throwaway contains the transformation of the previous resulting with the current token why this is taking so deciding which token to apply at each also takes you may wish to use a regular which internally builds a state machine to run through all rather than a set as i suggested but really killing you is the time to allocate all that for 2000 copies of a gibson your tokens so you have look for a thousand tokens the sort would take but it would probably end being faster since you have search thousands of tokens was my reasoning behind putting them into an associative array java but the other problem is if one token is and another is if there are any common that how do we is where answer comes in he delegates the matching to a which is a great as a regex already defines and implements how to do once the match is we can examine then use a java map an associative to find the obfuscated token for the unobfuscated wanted to concentrate my answer on the not just how to fix but on why there was a problem in the first	
you select an sdi project you get a whole framework get a document class from which ideally should hold all of the and a view class from to do with the get given a hosting frame with a menu already and there are functions you can override to save and load to you have a dialog based then you get one of this dialog can spawn off but the application essentially consists of a developing a small application that just does one a dialog application is because you need the you are developing an application where the user will be editing and saving then the sdi path would be more answered your politely ask if there was a compelling reason why you were choosing mfc over windows i believe that mfc was an excellent technology for its but the visual studio suite offers more advanced tools prepared to go down the

you should lock before setting the private this will be reflected in both threads the same you may want to take some time to consider how to handle the locks and your factory is creating the object and adding it to the it will need a lock of some form around the routine to create the possible that the two threads could ask for the object at the same before it was and create 2 i recommend setting the private member directly it would be a good idea to have a single object inside of the returned class instance used just for and use some form of accessor or that locks on that synchronization object and then sets the for not that its two instances you can always just do something to check in the add a check for reference or even temporarily add a guid to your class setup at construction easy to verify that the same that

you using any of the advanced features of jboss and you planning then probably better to go with a pure embedded this if a security fix is found in you can upgrade just the one single embedded component and move jboss is significantly larger and is thus more difficult to all you are using from jboss is jms or jndi or something else that is easily embeddable as a separate 3rd party component in then by all means drop jboss and move to just an embedded should you stick with when using jboss makes your life so much easier that the extra work of upgrading jboss is worth the this is true for many it sounds like it is not true in your far as integrating better with i expect that both integrate pretty well with i use which supports both jboss and so this may depend on what version of eclipse and what plugins you are

you will need to do is create a query that somehow groups your items by categories you already have that or you can use linq to create your hierarchy through a group by into you can use an itemscontrol that binds to the query displaying the data with an itemtemplate containing a header and another itemscontrol which has an itemspaneltemplate set to a wrappanel or a you manage to get your data in the following classes vb here but would not be far from that if you need class private as public property as return end value as end end private as new public property as return end value as end end class private as public property as return end value as end end is a very rough have to tinker with the borders to get what you but that would do the

your application run for long periods of time or is it more of a if the i personally would consider using the while it may not be the most desirable from a perspective it is certainly straightforward to implement and may foot the bill given the way your particular application idea of a separate executable makes perhaps another option would be to use not an expert in this area welcome to but as i understand put the api call in a separate dll and load it into a separate when the api call is finished or you have to abort you can unload the appdomain along with the this have the added benefit of cleaning up resources that a straightforward will

your example you suggested one service for articles and one service for that may of course be just an but in that case it would not make sense to separate because it would be quite likely and common to have queries routines which make use of both category data and article that in it usually makes the most sense to group routines by the degree to which they are related to one if you can separate all your possible routines three clean groups with little to no then it makes sense to have three if you cannot cleanly separate any of your you should limit yourself to one web regarding your statement being a downside of one web service that necessarily you can always create layers of abstraction the web so that the service class itself is simply a facade with many thin method calls that reach into bulkier logic the the only approach which truly matters because the only approach which works is the simplest approach build what you need to build in as few layers as you only add complexity when you reach a problem which cannot be solved in a better than by adding that it is always easier to add complexity than to take it
