a diagram that should make things more developing a plugin for another program that adds relationships and properties not already included in the these are defined in my tree trying to define this structure abstractly so that i could create implementations of the plugin for different as well as access the information from multiple implementations in a single methods are defined in the but the framework does not know about all the i was hoping i could avoid having the implementation projects pass a list of types to the methods in the framework but it seems i avoid i guess that make sense the methods must have access to the types they are this really explain the problem with as it is a concrete class in the framework i think what is happening is when i serialize the datacontractserializer has access to all the objects and their knowtype parameter and saves them but when i deserialize i create my datacontractserializer with dictionary as the so it only knows about but not the derived classes of tell it what all the derived types are because like i said they are in other projects that the framework project know soooooooo seems like the best solution is to have each implementation pass a list of node types it uses to the serialization and deserialization methods in the framework this make is there a better way to do

a long one so you might want to get that cup of been holding off on run a game called world of a turn based strategy game akin to risk or each player has a set of armies and the question revolves around the display of these currently the map is created using a background image with css positioning of team icons on top of that to represent you can see how it looks background image for the map is located and created in not designed to draw maps but hopelessly incompetent with photoshop and this works for my purposes just problem comes that i want to perform such fun things as pathfinding and for that i need to have the map somehow stored in i have tried using i have looked at incorporating it with i tried going and creating tiles as from many older games and finally i tried to use i say this so you can see clearly that not through lack of trying that i have this problem want to be able to store the map layout in code and both create an image from it and use it for things such as using python but i suspect that most answers will be the cities other such things are stored already and easily drawn i want to store the layout of the landmass and features on the for each type of terrain has a movement cost and when the map is stored as just an image i access the terrain of a given in addition to pathfinding i wish to be able to know the terrain for various things related to the cities in mountains produce stone for there a good way to do this and what terms should i have used in google because the terms i tried all came up with unrelated stuff being something completely different most of the can be placed anywhere on the map as can anywhere but in the water where drown and probably complain that chatting to somebody on msn who made me go over the really minute details and who has a better understanding of the game to the fact that played occurring to me that tiles are the way to go but not the way i had initially i put the bitmap down as it is now but also have a data layer of each tile has a given terrain type and thus pathfinding and suchlike can be done on it yet at the same time i still render using omnigraffle which works pretty will be making an editor for this as suggested by i know that graphs will be relevant but not had a chance to look into them fully really appreciate all those that answered my map from

a novice at so hopefully someone can spell this out for i tried following the multiple strings in sql but i got trying to do the same thing as the originator of the above posting but with a different table and different say that the following field in table has three records table actually has thousands of shiptoplant plant plant 2 what trying to type in the sql case when shiptoplant in then shiptoplant end from keep getting the message error in query expression when shiptoplant in then else shiptoplant want to do this operation for every character on the with exception of since it is a help you could provide would be greatly background information added from the have collected data from each our 14 suppliers for the 2008 calendar i am trying to normalize the plant names that are given to us by our supplier can call a plant by a different name on our master list could be called by service trying to strip chars so that i can try to identify the plant using our master listing by creating a series of links that look at the first 10 if no 8 basic is that i know how to strip the alphanumeric characters from the be doing this operation on several but i planned on creating separate queries to edit the other i need to do a mass update query that strips all the still unclear on how to write what i started out with to take out all the it worked but failed when i tried to nest the replace btst set shiptoplant further information taken from up to 100 new permutations of our plant names appear in our line item invoice this could represent thousands of invoice trying to construct a quick and dirty way to assign a of the definitive name to each plant name the best way i can see to do so is to look at the city and state but the problem with this is that these fields have various permutations as for brookview brookview taking out alphanumerics and doing by changing the number of characters until a match is found between the invoice data and the master plant listing tables contain the city and state you can eventually find a of when you start dwindling down the number of characters you are the accuracy becomes done this in excel and had decent can anyone recommend a better to replace multiple characters in access

abstraction i mean what should i call them and what kind of icon should i use to represent it in the the concept of tags should be familiar to most users right but not so sure hierarchical tags nor does the abstraction of tags completely i have is actually something between folders and in that each subtag is a proper subset of its to get the contents of a you take its contents plus the contents of its and do that in a way like where i just partially answered my own question in the process of asking what do you guys think of calling them what kind of icon would you give since a category is an abstract concept rather than a physical object that can take a wiki if for what looking for is an abstraction for an like aunt sally that easily grasp the ideally there is also a graphical representation that can be easily associated with that one thing i did forget to mention is that an item can exist in more than on category like how google doc allows you to add an document to multiple i guess kind sold myself on calling them it just fits everything you can do with something can belong to a more than one subcategories make most subcategories people normally create lend themselves to an relationship a windows user might have say a folder called resumes in their my documents because a resume is a it would make sense that in my documents as well if you think of the folders as i still figured out is the icon sure going to be using some kind of treeview to display them i could just use a folder icon i maybe a custom icon unless anyone else has a better google calls them so i guess it be too bad clarify my target audience will be people technical enough to know how to download and install the but about kind of abstraction should i use for hierarchical

actually think this is a pretty good there are a few ways of looking at this could be seen negatively for one one thing you can do in a normal interview to sort the wheat from the chaff is ask them what they know about your company and the good that are keen to work for you and generally eager and have looked you up and at least gone to your website you have and found out what it is you so by asking them this upfront you are losing the opportunity to see how much initiative they of course you make up for this in other areas eg by asking questions that a reasonable person may have looked up other potential negative is that it can often be hard to understand an a business or a product from the outside looking i worked in for and not until you get to a place like that that you can see all the different teams new call centre and so and get an understanding of what they do and why they do understadning the culture is also hard without being a part of brann is right in that you want someone who is capable of understanding it rather than someone who actually you might be excluding good potential hires who will pick up your business quite being i like where going with the forcing a candidate to think about things like that is a good perhaps you could narrow the focus to a single aspect of your which is more digestable in a typically this will also allow you to give you the opportunity to see how much initative they took beyond the scope of the original

ad for your authentication is a great since you need to add everyone there and for intranet users no need for an extra correct that allows you to use a provider which will allow you to authenticate against although nothing included to give you group membership support quite trivial to implement if you want i can provide a real issue here is if you want to use ad groups to define permissions within each so then you do have the option of creating your own roleprovider for that can also be used by winforms and wpf apps via this roleprovider could link the id of the user in ad to per app which you can store in your own custom which also allows each app to allow administration of these roles without requiring these admins to have extra privileges in you want you can also have an override and combine app roles with ad so if in some global group in ad they get full permission in the app regardless of app role conversely if they have either a group or property in ad to say been fired you could ignore all app role membership and restrict all access hr probably remove them from each and every assuming they even know about them code added as based on this original work your

addition to what others have already there are also benefits specific to using cloud services by companies like what some might is not inherently in most quite the opposite this is because most companies do not have the resources to provide the level of reliability and redundancy that like microsoft or amazon unless you are hosting source code for a defense project or other projects where the threat of espionage is very the greatest threats to your code and your business are more mundane things like cloud services provide levels of redundancy that most businesses simply cannot obtain on their this includes data redundancy hardware redundancy and geographical redundancy server locations across the if a natural disaster hits your is your data going to be each small business by itself cannot afford support staff and dollar but pooling their resources together through a cloud service affords them centralization and better resource access to a much higher level of related to by centralizing the data of thousands of this allows security resources to be much more tightly it should be noted that most commercial hosting providers offer and dedicated and even cloud service providers allow customers to configure their however they and whatever applications on it they so you can have a great deal more freedom than that offered by web

afraid standard stuff of is not what you you can try to change authentication module so it you in with what roles does your visitor perhaps you will use some special table that corresponds user and custom principal with user roles enumerated and assign identity and principal to the current also think that making special roles for each site is good when you would have hundred you would also have two hundred pretty i we were solving similar we were just not using standard we had single set of roles used on all membership of concrete user is determined according to current site and his relations to this another possibility to investigate is application that exists in authentication maybe possible to isolate each subsite into separate method that works for our not make a lot of cloned use only users and if your sites are public then role could be just global user on one site differ from user on another if and are different then of course should also be bound to a standard membership but do not use standard role a mechanism for storing relation between site and it could be simple table that holds site user is and you have to override is isinrole to be cover it this method is in iprinciple so you have to make your own principal quite isinrole of this type should look take current site look into the table and get you have to associate your principal with a do it in postauthenticaterequest is also honestly not sure when is it but it also have isinrole we can override it in the same but other methods of this provider are for example it accepts array of user names and but to what context should it be to not because i know when this method is so it requires some i see that ropeprincipal by itself uses roleprovider to fetch list of so maybe implement only using standard for our application this is not a so i say what problems could be hidden

after a tool to generate documents from that needs invoked through code on ideally invoked from code within a report files that contain their own internal data query etc ideally so that we can push simple report files to the and it simply work where maintenance is not necessarily a developer data from a database server based on parameters that we pass through to pdf or where standalone simply means that the report is fully it is fully expected that additional reporting runtime components will be required to execute the contrast to rdlc which uses the from the local vs looked at the options studio but rdlc seems to be coupled to the assembly and rdl seems to lack the export the version of crystal reports included in vs2008 seems very similar to rdlc presumably the full crystal reports offering has more but has a price tag welcome any suggestions for an professional looking tool that might be suitable and a report document template tool to generate documents from sql

after the call to returns it is safe to discard the data you passed to if you do that have a memory like in this int new pass the pointer to the buffer to the call but then the pointer is lost and most likely what you should do is store it and delete it aftet the call if the texture is of a constant you can pass a pointer to an array that is on the int if you want to worry about pointers and you can use

agree with charlie about tests corresponding more to user actions and the correctness of the system as a i do think there is alot more value to unit tests than just localizing failures more tightly unit tests provide two main values over integration writing unit tests is as much an act of design as if you practice test driven driven development the act of writing the unit tests helps you design exactly what you code should it helps you write higher quality code being loosely coupled helps with and it helps you write just enough code to make your tests pass your tests are in effect your the second value of unit tests is that if they are properly written they are very very if i make a change to a class in your project can i run all the corresponding tests to see if i broke how do i know which tests to and how long will they i can guarantee it will be longer than well written unit you should be able to run all of you unit tests in a couple of minutes at the	
agree with devin and would add that dealing with special values may look good in small example cases but a few notable nan in fpus and null in it scale nearly as the only time it works is typically got lots of nested homogeneous processing math or care about distinguishing error care where the error operations are pure with no side can be given a reasonable meaning at the higher level rows	
agree with however if your dealing with a string that i would break muliple lines to assist in you are litterally trying to create 257 then why not use the dupestring function in the strutils easier to and maintain if you are doing this in a loop and therefore are worried about then assign the function result to a local variable and use the slotsofas ix slotsofas for ix 0 to 1000000 slotsofas

algorithm applies more to weighted paths and it sounds like the poster was wanting to find all not just the this build a graph application sounds like it need to be and use your favorite search it sounds like you want all not just a guess at the shortest so use a simple recursive algorithm of your only problem with this is if the graph can be the looking for a path from you could have a cycle of 1 2 3 that then keep a stack as traversing the a list with the steps for that graph and the resulting stack for the formatting no table next nodes minus where we came duplicate number on the stack cycle to node three and popped 1 off the no more nodes to explore from to node 2 and popped 1 off the target node found record stack for a no more nodes to explore from to node 2 and popped 4 off the no more nodes to explore from to node 1 and popped 2 off the duplicate number on the stack cycle to node 2 and popped 1 off the target node found record stack for a no more nodes to explore from to node 2 and popped 4 off the no more to node 3 and popped 2 off the no more to node 1 and popped 3 off the no more with 2 recorded paths of and

all of the deficiencies of c would force you to code around making you write more code making you more experienced in lacking any portable integer bigger than for c in the made me write my own bignum lack of implicit resource and error management maybe force c users to write a lot of and cleanup it may just be but never tired of writing such i go and read the documentation of every external function i return to my code and check for every return value and other it even makes me feel last point is probably the biggest one to be made in favor of the you can only write so many pairs before you start to analyze the lifetime of every single variable you come across in every single objects help this truly portable c code often requires the programmer to be free of a lot assumptions about the host system think unsigned while this helped me write better code in other it has helped me think about possible alternate how a tiny microprocessor could still run my c generating a gazillion risc instructions for my simple is another not many other languages map to and from a given assembly language so easily in my then that may just be none of these arguments go only for has a valid point fortran might be an equally good but there is so much c code a whole personal computer system from top to bottom to libraries to drivers to is available in source code in it would be such a waste if you could not read

already initialization lists get completely executed entering the constructor so it is completely safe to use members in the constructor have made a comment in the accepted answer about having to to the constructor but not the member inside the constructor you is possible that you mistook the fact that you refer to parameters and not to member attributes the initialization as an given a class x that has two members and of type the following constructor may be int a a possible problem here is that the construction of the elements in the initialization list depends on the order of declaration in the class and not the order in which you type the initialization if the class were defined int a int int regardless of how you type the initialization list the fact is that will be executed is initialized since the declaration of the members is first and later that will create a bug as your code believes probably on being twice the value of and in fact contains the simplest solution is not refering to the int a a correct regardless of how x is this pitfall is the reason why you are suggested not to use member attributes as part of the initialization of other

always it there are no size fits you need to store data in a file and you can take advantage of relational database capabilities of an sql database than sqlite is your data is not a good fit for a relational model data for or you want your data to be humanly readable or you need to interoperate with another system than sqlite be very helpful and xml might be on the other hand you need to access the data from multiple programs or computers at the same time than again sqlite is not an optimal choice and you need a database server posgresql

always think this is easier to explain with a you have an icustomerrepository an ishoppingcartrepository interface and an icheckout you have concrete implementations of those interfaces and checkoutservice concrete class has a constructor that takes an icustomerrepository and an ishoppingcartrepository ishoppingcartrepository set fields for use in some methods when you want an icheckoutservice implementation to do some work you tell your ioc container which concrete class it should use for each interface type and ask it to build you an your ioc container will go and build your classes for injecting the correct concrete classes into the constructor of your it will also build dependencies all the way down the class heirarchy so for example your shoppingcartrepository takes an idatabasesession interface in the your ioc container will inject that dependency as long as you have told it which concrete class to use for your some code you might use when configuring as your ioc container code would typically be called during app class appregistry public to get an instance of icheckoutservice built up and ready to with all the dependencies passed into the constructor for you would use something checkoutservice hope that makes

am a senior software and a few months ago i have been asked to help with of bug the project manager has given me an objective of improving productivity to 1 bug correction per this has been a real and i would like to know what other may have done to improve bug correction factors that play a role in this is geographically distributed developers in each code base that i am not all that familiar with as i have been with the company for only 9 the least experienced developers are allocated to bug most capable developers are working on follow so we use source continuous bug project has schedule and specs for new we have testers and do usability code is dependent on many in house and third party components manager has some old bug correction showing bug correction per my concern is that this was based on a team of experienced developers working on a correcting bugs in code that they themselves now i am a team of developers that are not familiar with the and the bugs are originating from the validation more information after reading first few have tried to argue against using the bugs corrected productivity get too far with this bugs are prioritized include a severity and tagged with additional information blocked by another bugs have a unit test case written when they are in particular area of code are allocated to the people familiar with that if correction rates are tracked on a per team and correction history is daily stand ups i try to get people moving by asking for blocking issues and solving new code is written with unit i have been doing my best to improve the productivity metric by various means closing old creating and correcting bugs for issues that would otherwise be solved without a bug have developed python scripts that access the bug database directly to automate some mundane aspects of bug management and for report productivity to 1 bug correction per

am assuming that when you make the call to execute the query you have the and you receive the so at that point you have it seems like you could do your analysis maybe catching things further what you might do is on your own custom subclass of add a triggeringsqlstatement member with a getter and and then at the place where you attempt to execute the catch the original exception from create a new set the triggeringsqlstatement to be the statement you just and call on the databaseexception to set the exception caught from postgresql as the cause of your then throw your databaseexception and the calling code which catches it will have an object that prints out a very decent stack trace of what happened plus provides access to the sql statement that caused the for more information on this you might want to research java exception even if you use all of what i just i think you should definitely be using java exception chaining not a spot anywhere in the code where you have access to both the sql statement that caused the problem and the exception that gets be very curious as to and how that is and suggest you redesign your code so that you do have such a since wanting to see the sql statement first thing in the you could probably also override your method other appropriate not sure what gets called when an exception is printed to print out the included sql assuming you included it as i described

am attempting to write expand on an graph search algorithm that will let me find the path to get closest to destination node considering there is no guarantee that the nodes will be provide a realistic application of say i need to get from ontario to i know my possible options at my start point are local go bus or i know that walking is the least desired way to get to my destination so i look at go bus i know i can take go to a point close to but at that point the go bus turns and goes another direction at that closest point is at a place where i have no options than but the algorithm would only consider walking for short distances otherwise it will consider the route not this same if the algorithm were to find that i can get there a way that is longer but gets me closer to the destination node possible at the destination that would be a higher weighted path weightings matter so much while its only when the results are it would list by which path was closest to the destination in ascending for one go bus may get me 3km from the destination while 3 public transit buses would get me 500m my question is two what algorithm should i start with that does something how would i programmaticly explain that ok if nodes connect so that it just jump from node a to node would starting from the end and working backward accomplish i forgot to ask how to aim for the best approximate solution because especially with a large graph there will be possibly millions of solutions for this to design an approximate path

am considering starting a project which is used to generate code in java using annotations get into as not really i am wondering about the validity and usefulness of the and something that has struck me is the dependence on the annontation processor tool like to as i speak from is what are the drawbacks of using annotation processing in could be including the likes is hard to do tdd when writing the is difficult to include the processing on a build takes a long and it is very difficult to get it to run the annotations in an ide requires a plugin for to get it to behave the same when reporting are just not my i am in the process of researching if any of these are true asking this question am sure there must be drawbacks specifically list not using as an but i have the experience with it to tell what they no matter how petty or is the ony reasonable alternative to using annotation processing is probably to create plugins for the relevant ides to generate the code would be something vaguely similar to methods feature that would generate all the signatures without method that step would have to be repeated each time relevant parts of the code annotation processing would as far as i can regards to the example given with the invasive amount of i envision the use needing to be anything like maybe a handful for any given that stop it being abused of drawbacks of annotation processing in

am creating a class library with many different options for possible for you can design your class so that it can perform or you can design your class so that it can perform normal you would simply create an interface ifeaturex with a pure virtual method called and another interface ifeaturey with a pure virtual method called if a class has both featurex and it can inherit from no problem what if a requires an object that can perform both and how do i express a in but an answer in java could help as to ensure that both featurex and featurey are i create another interface ifeaturexy that inherits from ifeaturex and if there are only two features i could get away with but if there are 10 the number of possible interfaces becomes there a simple way to do i tried solving the problem using templates and delegation but get too hoping there is a simple solution to and there probably is one that i just appreciate any help and advice you guys inheritance delegation

am currently being offered a job for an it development business i already do my freelance job and pays well this job sounds good and it would enable me to keep my current job while doing the other the thing they want to outsource me without giving me any credit whatsoever for the development but the full the side of getting payment it sounds but on the side of only helping another company build its own reputation using my work i quite like it yes i so i started thinking and came up with possibly encrypting my found some tools online to do that however not sure how good is it to actually do i would it affect the functionality or loading also is it really that recommendable for me to do i know what to think right u guys mind telling me your opinions on the to thing here is not that being contracted by a business so that i develop for them specifically they just want to outsource what i that this it business will pay me for doing it while they tell the client they did it then you can think they be able to duplicate it or they try to duplicate it at least take some time to undestand the but face it in the end if they want to they will be able to understand and replicate my code something like the issue here is that i am interested in working with them since get me jobs abroad in mexico and the jobs would be for another and really like to get to be known but this it business agree to give me some i currently have many other options for getting to be known it recommended to encrypt

am currently tasked with creating a consistent architecture guide for software we have a lot of smart people doing the right but just not consistently and are using application architecture guide as a starting hence coming up with an application architecture is fairly say straight possibly because i have a couple of years experience as a developer so i have a pretty good understanding of this realm and there are also loads of examples and our organisation has a couple of applications that form 1 or more systems which we then install we thought it would make sense to create a system architecture and an enterprise architecture as and this is where the problems is no consistent guidance out if you search for architecture the stuff that you get back is so different that i am wondering if there is a way to do my understanding of it the system architecture is an abstraction of 1 or more application architectures depicting how they work together to form a an enterprise architecture is a further abstraction showing how your fit into a organisations enterprise and how it interacts with the business it strategy and how it integrats into other systems in the i have it completely there any standards out there where can i find there be or would a system architecture simply be any document in any format which is clearly and easily understandable and useful to its would the seasoned architects think of that approach want to simply list a set of soa related patterns that may be like to make it a little more focused to what we which is the build financial solutions on a service orientated what about does anyone have experience with it at all and is it worth the effort of trying to understand it in systems and application architecture

am dealing with a content editable div and i need to deal with capturing key strokes both before and after the character has been added to the understanding of capturing bubbling is that the event gets captured at the highest level in the dom tree first then passes it while for bubbling it starts at the lowest level and bubbles up the on that i thought that if i added an event listener at the capturing the content of the editable div would reflect the text from the keystroke had been if i add an event listener at the bubbling the text content will contain the character i just seem to be the case whether the event listener is added at the capturing or bubbling the content never includes the most recently typed is a simple test case to try it var div would expect the output of the second function to include the new text after typing a but this seem to be the question is there a way to capture a keystroke event from a content editable div and get the content as it will be the key is i need this for implementing typeahead know that i can stop the event and then use but this breaks down when handling pastes and other types of so that is not a am testing this in firefox i know that ie have an addeventlistener for any capturing bubbling with a contenteditable

am designing an and like to ask a few questions about how best to secure access to the the api is allowing access to artists have that have users of the api have access to a subset of all the if a user calls the api asking for some it is easy to check if the user is allowed to do if the user asks for an the api has to check if the album belongs to an artist that the user is allowed to accessing songs means that the api has to check the album and then the artist before access can be database i am looking at an increasing number of joins between tables for each additional layer that is i want to do all those and i also want to store the user id everywhere in order to limit the number of work around i came up with the following api gives the user a reference to an for instance an artist the user can then ask that artist object for the which returns a list the list object can be and album objects can be obtained from from an album object a songlist object can be obtained and from the individual song the api trusts the artist it also trusts any objects in this that the user gets from without further and so forth for all the other so i am delegating the to objects down the would like to ask you what you think of good or bad about and of how you would solve this how would you approach this if the api should be my approach seems less applicable in that do i secure data access in my new	
am designing this hr system for a the thing is i have all the tables designed and was planning on using the in vs2008 to generate the entity classes is the first time i work with in this is my first i wanted to make the app with 3 layers of the programmers of the company suggested not 3 but 4 or 5 but after reading quite a lot of blog entries and a lot of questions here realized that is not quite easy to do that with linq to sql because of how the datacontext works and how difficult it is to pass objects between layers using linq to just use the entity classes generated by the vs2008 orm and add any validation and bussines logic in partial that would be 2 or the app will be used by like 10 so i think the 2 layer approach is a big issue for the a will be developed so candidates can apply to jobs i want to develop it as scalable as but the truth is i have a lot of time to waste to make a times running up said all should i just use the entities generated by the vs2008 any suggestion or idea would be greatly to sql orm

am experiencing a weirdest thing for the last couple of i found out that my release build actually executes than the debug the finally stripped all stuff from my entry point in my windows forms leaving only static void stopwatch sw xmls new i am actually not instantiating any forms only is a small class with only three public properties and nothing my main is if that makes any debug my elapsed time is while in release it takes additional strange thing is when i try to set some other project in that solution as startup because in that case it works fast the same code as quick fix this bug as quickly as i created a new startup project in my which instantiates and runs the main application form by referencing my first entry in that case it works fast my entry exe is now only 24kb containing only a static main anyone encountered similar behavior if i had stumbled upon this somewhere by looking at the code i would probably presume that there is a static initializer doing tons of work in a separate thread not the case i have that and furthermore running only in release more i am aware that xmlserializer generates il code in but my actual question is why it works slower in this case than in other when i benchmark only the actual it is 3x slower in release only if i run it from my initial now for the weirdest part after a couple of my new entry project started to behave as the first one slow slow i changed the project name and guid and rebuilt it and working fast release build working slower than

am new to artificial i understand k nearest neighbour algorithm and how to implement how do you calculate the distance or weight of things that on a distance of age can be easily but how do you calculate how near is red to maybe colours is a bad example because you still can say use the how about a burger to pizza to fries for got a feeling a clever way to do you in advance for your kind thank you all for very nice it really helped and i appreciate but i am thinking there must be a way i do it this say i am using my knn algorithm to do a prediction for a person whether will eat at my restaurant that serves all three of the above of other factors but to keep it for the field of favourite out of 300 150 loves 100 loves and 50 loves common sense tells me favourite food affect decision on whether to eat or now a person enters favourite food as burger and i am going to predict whether going to eat at my ignoring other and based on my previous knowledge common sense tells me that a higher chance the k nearest distance for this particular field favourite food is nearer as compared to if he entered pizza or only problem with that is that i used and i might be wrong because i know and probably calculate the actual i also worry about this field putting too little weight on my prediction because the distance probably to scale with other factors time of whether the restaurant is etc that i can easily but i guess i might be able to get around it with some parameter everyone put up a great but i can only accept in that just accept the one with highest votes thank you all once nearest neighbour algorithm

am of the view that applications are so different from each other and our understanding of how applications should be written is sill very past windows forms applications i have worked on have been so different from each some of the design differences i have seen are most talk to database a backend that has been written for the given application a set of web services that were written for use by many applications and be changed for your being done by being done with the commands to backend of usages of no usages of data data being that work well in standard grid controls need custom controls for most of the ui developer teams of 10 or 20 developers on the of unit test using mocks etc no unit tests i think possible to create one implementation of mvc that always fits best posts i have seen really mvc and a mvc system is built the way it is the your own series by jeremy d after working though it you should be able to understand your options a lot smart client guidance microsoft composite application should also be it is a bit complex but can work well for applications that have a good a implementation for a winforms give an overview that is worth a lot of people like i have never used but will look at it the next time i need a mvc is a software development approach that combines the ideas of the model view presenter design pattern and it lets you start of by writing tests in the language i click the button the file should be saved and unsaved file warning have no experience using but will give it a try when i get a as it looks very stackoverflow questions you may may wish to look at and you are thinking of useing at any point take a look at the viewmodel here is a very good video you should take a look dolinger on view view design pattern for give another option that may make it easer to convert to wpf if every is yet another mvvm sample for winforms that also includes auto binding based on property ask yourself you are using you wish to be able to unit test as much code as you trying to allow as much code as possible to be you trying to make your code base easy to other reasons that can be valid for a given you are clear on your it becomes easier to choose an implementation or

am working on a group senior project for my university and i have run into a major hurdle in trying to get my code to compiler that we have for our 8 bit atmel microcontroller does not support the new or delete and it does not support the i could program it in but i have to implement an algorithm which i have never done while i have tried c initially i soon realized that i never did pure c trying to model objects with structs and functions is slowing me down since i am so used to the much cleaner the exact wording for my compilers shortcomings can be found overcome them and still use i have considered the following allocate just use templates to generate fixed arrays on the allocate and find some hack to call the constructor for objects once i have allocated the space for placement new an option since new an just use c and suck it its a microcontroller why am i getting find a better compiler which will probably cost second option is the hardest but it would have the biggest pay off in terms of how i can write this i imagine that debugging it could be a huge pain if i get it thinking of creating objects on the copying their bits into the allocated and then zeroing the bits in the object so it call its to do that i would access the bits directly with an unsigned char pointer and the sizeof operator to get the byte sounds terrible and i know if it could work but i am considering i know vtables can be a problem but i intend on having any vtables since it is just an 8 bit can you do when your embedded compiler have operator new or stl

am working on an application which accepts any uploaded csv stores it alongside other datasets which have been uploaded and then produces output or based on the user selecting which they want the database will be automatically expanded to handle columns and datatypes as this is in preference to a uploading these 2 sets to a blank dept age sales it dept age sales 24 it 32 programatically change the table so that importing dataset a results in 3 newly created columns importing dataset b results in 1 newly created column at the forget about whether the recordsets should be combined or not and that no issue i have is that some columns will also have lookup values say that the dept column will at some point in the future have associated values which give the address and phone numbers of that the same could be true for the salary looking up tax groupings number of columns in this big table should not become too high few but will be high enough to want the user to administer the lookup table structure and values through an admin panel rather than have to involve developers each is whether to use individual lookup tables for each column or a combined lookup table which references the column normally i would opt for individual lookup but here the application will need to create them automatically and then add a new join into the master sql this would be done at the request of the user rather than when the added avoid hundreds of empty combined lookup table on the other hand would need to be joined multiple times onto the data selecting on the column name each lookups seems to make sense to me but i may be barking up completely the wrong creation of new lookup tables based on values in main data

am writing a library in in which i have among a class originally written in but converted into i know much about so therefore i have used online to now i am stuck with some code which i believe the was not able to running the code i get the following was at really understand the reason for this i believe this error might be due to the fact that is able to automatically convert an integer variable into a string needs the or due to the fact is using an incremental operator which is not supported by is the original in where is a void string the primary character if int idx while code original code works when using a created in is the converted code in which gives me the error mentioned sub primarycharacter as byval alternatecharacter as the primary character if 0 dim idx as integer while idx primarycharacter idx end end if code original code may be found should say that the code in the class is quite advanced for me a hobby programmer but learning every so maybe i see obvious things but this is the reason why i am asking you please give me any hints to sort out this is the complete sub in appends a metaphone character to the and a possibly different metaphone keys for the primary character to append to primary if no alternate char is the alternate key as alternate character to append to alternate may be null or a in which case the primary character will be appended to the alternate key private void string the primary character if int idx while the alternate character if character was if it is not append the primary string as long as it zero length and a space if if int idx while but if the primary character is add that if 0 int idx while else if no alternate character was but a primary so append the primary character to the alternate int idx while unable to convert code from to due to incremental operator or automatic string conversion

an excellent book that is not as widely but is full of deep software the cooperative by alistair so special about clearly everyone has heard the term and it seems most are believers these whether you believe or there are some deep principles behind why the agile movement this book uncovers and articulates these principles in a scientific some of the principles are these are my not hardest thing about team software development is getting brains to have the same we are building complex systems which are invisible in the tangible the better you are at getting more brains to share deeper the more effective your team will be at software is the underlying reason that pair programming makes most people dismiss it i did too but with this principle in mind i highly recommend that you give it another you wind up with two people who deeply understand the subsystem you just built there many other ways to get such a deep information transfer so it is like a vulcan mind always need words to communicate deep understanding and a too many and you exceed the meaning the understanding transfer attempting does not consider that children learn how to speak language by being and not just language either he gives the example of some kids playing with trains on the along comes another kid who has never even a train before but by watching the other he picks up the gist of the game and plays right this happens all the time between this along with the corollary about too many words helps you see how misguided it was in the old days to try to write 700 page detailed requirements is so much more in there shut up but i highly recommend this

and wsdl are extremely complicated which have many implementations that support different subsets of the soap does not map very well to a simple foreign function interface in the same way that you have to understand about xml xml and so on to produce correct soap all you need to do to call an service is to define and endpoint and call a method on for in there are other techniques that can also be much more simple and such as plain xml or over http referred to as though that implies certain other design the advantage of something like xml or json over http is that easy to use from javascript or even just a dumb web page with a form it can also be scripted easily from the command line with tools like it works with just about any language as http xml and json libraries are available almost and even if a json parser is not it is very easy to write your i should clarify that i am referring to how heavyweight soap as opposed to heavy weight it is in terms of raw amount of i think that the raw amount of data is less important it adds up quick if you need to handle lots of small while how conceptually heavyweight it is is quite because that means that there are a lot more places where something can go where there can be an

another encounter with one of the pitfalls of the data that you want products where the matches and the matches say in your question that the property actually just the a big part of the question how are you representing the list of required will they be passed as a delimited stored in a temporary the sql built something you can get them into a table or then the following queries should because of the performance is going to be very dependent on the amount of data that you are working with and how it is if you end up with duplicate properties in your table for the same product then it could throw things so you may need to account for products not left outer join properties p2 is as properties inner join pst group join products p from

another thread were to check the variable i believe it to quirks in the memory see a partially initialized the new of java memory model means that any fields should be set to their values before the object becomes visible to other threads long as the reference to the newly created object escape from the constructor in any other but beyond that there many share data without appropriate locking guarantees given by static inializers memory models are seriously as is programming in try to avoid this becoming a terms the assignment happens the constructor runs so if you observe the variable the same it will be null during the constructor as i say there are memory model for the purposes of you can get away with this your field is and using java 5 or prior to java 5 the memory model strong enough for you need to get the pattern right see effective 2nd item 71 for more my reasoning for arguing against inlining being visible in a single suppose we class public static foo f public static void f new make this nested if you i believe it affects the class public boolean public fwasnull believe this will report from three steps are the operand is evaluated to produce a if this evaluation then the expression completes abruptly for same the operand not evaluated and no the operand is if evaluation completes the assignment expression abruptly for the same reason and assignment the value of the operand is converted to the type the is to value set conversion the appropriate standard value an value and the result of the conversion stored into the from actions can be ordered by a if one action then the first is visible to and ordered before the we have two actions x and we write to indicate that x x and y are actions of the same thread and x comes before y in program then is a edge from the end of a constructor of an object to the start of a finalizer for that an action x a following action then we also have and then should be noted that the presence of a relationship between two actions does not necessarily imply that they have to take place in that order in an if the reordering produces results consistent with a legal it is not other okay for weird stuff to happen even within a single thread that be in this case the difference be which is why i believe it would be

ansi is not defined like one of the reasons not defined like that is that some environments will indeed throw null pointer or crash in other ansi c leaves the implementation of open to compiler code shown above is typical for that do not actively check for null but fail only when bytes are read from a null	
ansi should be the same as it refers to the ansi which is simply the ratified version of use of the characters is not defined in as it is a character years of misuse of the term by the dos and subsequently windows community has left its practical meaning as system codepage of whatever machine is being the system codepage is also sometimes known as since on east asian systems that can be a some code pages can even use bytes as trailing bytes in a multibyte so not even strict compatible with plain but even still called us and western european default maps to windows code page this is not the same as it is quite on other machines it could be anything else at this makes utterly useless as an external encoding

answer is but let me offer the perspective of someone who is using have sort of been the whipping boy of the rails community for a everyone understands the drawbacks of but no one is really championing their in my factories by themselves can easily become just as difficult to maintain as fixtures really depends on the but i the real strength of factories is in selective replacement of talk about a couple first issue is if you can test most of your app without hitting the database then you will see a significant speed but for most applications i think wise to test without hitting the database at some point you want to test the whole every time you mock or stub you are making an assumption about an interface that may contain subtle assuming that you need to hit the database on some significant percentage of transactional fixtures using transactional fixtures could well be much much faster than instantiating a whole environment for every with the size of your test suite that you really need to look towards to scale your development to the next no matter how much you speed them still a long time for developers to maybe look at as well to help at the individual but ultimately ci is going to allow you to maintain testing discipline without sacrificing developer place where fixtures really shine is in the way i look at it is that the fixtures should set up a healthy base state for the app to be most unit tests really need you can get very good unit coverage using however when it comes to functional any given page may be hitting dozens of i want to set up all that stuff in each as i construct ever more complex getting closer and closer to recreating a global data state which is what fixtures were designed to do in the first controversial belief i hold is that all else being i prefer one functional test to 20 unit tests rails because the functional test proves that the end result that is sent to the user is the unit tests are great for getting at nuances of but at the end of the you could still have a bug along an interface that breaks your entire functional tests are what give me the confidence hitting deploy without actually loading up the page in my i know that i could stub everything out and test both interfaces and get the same but if i can test the whole stack in one simple test at the expense of a little much rather do what are my best practices for up a handful for every model to cover the broadest categories of adding a major new feature that cuts across many models and add some new fixtures to represent the major editing old fixtures except for factories for more localized factories for testing pagination or other mass creation that is only needed for a few let me recommend for really good pragmatic testing the thing i like most about blog is that he always acknowledges that testing is very and what works for one project does not necessarily work for

answer is it depends on what your application whether it accesses memory a lot or kevin is the processor does have to do address translation a but this probably hurt the performance of your application too the underlying hardware instructions are mostly the same between x86 and amd64 and there is not too much inefficiency there assuming the clr authors knew what they were doing sure they you might see a big performance difference if doing graphics but since this is just a i think you for some number crunching tasks you might notice a difference as mehrdad though be surprised if you i would say not to worry about the performance issues unless you have a then only worry about performance issues once you understand the nature of your

answer probably depends how critical it is for you to receive support and possible customization for this can certainly do look into their xml and geocoding you should be able to craft an xml message asking google to return map coordinates for a given if the address is not found you will receive an appropriate a useful that aim in providing the maps api is to plot addresses on actual while you can certainly use the data for other you are at the mercy of google should one of their maps not exactly correspond to your legal or commercial address validation if you paid for one of the services you you would likely be able to receive support should certain addresses not resolve the way you expect them other you get what you pay for if you have the why not try implementing a solution then going from the api looks pretty and after

answer to the question language is this or is always objectivity is valid and you can somehow reach a conclusion about a language being better for x even if your team is happy with some other language that is not the first choice for a certain but the work can be done a wise team will choose the language that makes them happy because their productivity will also be no one can tell you his choice is better than your they can try to persuade but if for some reason x language makes you more they cannot do anything about said ruby has improved a lot as far as performance is if you ask my biased opinion is choose ruby because i like but if you wanted an unbiased we would have to discuss more aspects and examine what exactly you want to do with the	
answer to this question depends on a number of backwards compatible do you need to including ie6 will decrease the capacity of pure much of your site is there are certain things in css that become hard if not impossible in variable width height content is a problem for you can use floats for this but if the sum of widths exceeds the width of the the tail end floats will fall down tables are more capable in this regard as they will squeeze columns where possible to make things fit and cells will never be split onto new centering you its trivial with tables and hard or impossible on compatibility and fixed or variable heights of the container and the in pure may also be referring to hover ie6 only supports the pseudo element on javascript is required for that browser for if what you need to do can be done fairly trivially with pure css then do if feel bad if you have to use tables despite all the fanatics they are jumping up and down in you want a relatively simple exmaple of this check out you do this html layout without using this is a conceptually simple layout problem that is trivial with tables and noone has yet posted a solution meeting the requirements with pure

answer your question there seem to be any way to taking a long time to return under the specific circumstances you described checking remote host reachability via wifi connection to a router with no a couple of make the call in a separate thread so that the rest of your app can keep modify as follows for an modified version of existing query the systemconfiguration framework for the state of the network check remote host status in a separate thread so that the ui nsautoreleasepool nstimer new use a different that uses a timeout value when trying to connect to the remote that way your app would only hang for x seconds before it gives other things to specific call to that asking about line in is trying to see if is to deduce if external is in system config framework might not mean what you think it according to the official seems to mean in your computer could connect to host x if it wanted but it might need to actually establish a connection first dial a modem in other actually establish a	
answer your what software do i need to download and there are a number of subversion clients for including that integrates with visualstudio and one that is very popular with our which integrates with windows the server recommend going with a hosted solution if your corporate policies just put into google and compare the available if i recommend installing the windows binaries from the what do i need to install the software windows subversion is available for all major platforms from the above so if a windows windows 2003 is if you are you may have a bit of an easier time configuring it behind apache on subversion is and has instructions for configuration on all platforms should i have a dedicated server or is an existing file server i recommend hosting externally over hosting it any hosting provider worth using will provide the following securely from anywhere via https need to configure corporate firewalls to work from home or a client backups need to set up new backup procedures for that dedicated server or file server in your need to worry about the box melting down or having some other issue that your team will have to deal with setup rather than having to learn server side configuration your company requires hosting it and there is sufficient space carved out on the file i would say not a problem to use an existing if you have a dedicated server that will be better just from the perspective of not having to with other parts of the organization assuming a shared how quickly will developers get up to is the integration similar enough to just carry on as there is a slight learning curve for but chapter 2 of the bean as well as the documentation for the clients explains how a regular work cycle if your developers are familiar with cvs be up to speed in no if they it may take a little while to get used to the notion that you have to lock files to work on them has a locking mechanism but not designed to be part of the standard work feel free to contact me directly if you have any other

answers are missing something read someone please tell me how print out a variable in my seems like an easy thing to do but i just seem do xslt there are two main ways of producing the contents of an depending on whether it contains a scalar value number or or has a structured value a or more nodes from xml use this to produce a scalar actually produces a text containing this scalar use this to produce a copy of all nodes contained in the is very important to that if an contains a list of nodes and the instruction is only the string value of the first node will be this is a frequently committed error and a is a third if the should be used in producing an xpath expression in the curly braces is evaluated and the result is put into the attribute xslt the instruction when run not in compatibility produces a list of text nodes one for each node contained in the when run in compatibility mode the attribute the instruction behaves in the same way as it does in xslt xslt behaves in the same way as in xslt however it is recommended to use the new because the former produces a new copy of every while does not produce new copies of

any graphics compression algorithm is going to do what you heavily optimized for compressing 2d arrays of numbers into the smallest possible to other thing to since looking to use compression to reduce processing is that getting really high compression ratios generally involves more calculation to compress and decompress the you may reach a point where spending more time compressing and decompressing the array than running the neural again to on your it sounds like what you may want is a use the curve to turn your array into a 1x2500 line and then come up with a formula that approximates the values you want for each cell of the the array have to be it may be much easier to fill with a space filling curve if a square of slightly different the hilbert curve works nicely for dimensions that are powers of for

anyone here ever built or maintained a third what steps did you take to get can you really to throw one in been brought in a few times to cleanup second systems gone steps i took are to be frank the system built by experts note that calling baby and you are not liked for doing we throwing one throwing away the ineffective software in note that saying that the previous software is a not an you are not liked for doing been brought in other times to build a working every design goes through all three understand the problem domain the the first system is a it has problem domain kluges technical the first system always has some management declares puts it into production and users hate it because the problem domain developers hate it because of the technical in a few i have continued on past the initial klugy the real work fix the problem domain kluges dig out the lies the users find the business and stupid fix the technical requires which requires unittests so that you can that the problem domain kluges are the most users say just a simple of the when really not a copy but a second users say give me a and then turn that into a magical key that does everything away the problem domain stuff is it takes a while for users to wrap their head around what they lobby for of the process the users realize they their business or their relationships or their when the third system can in one case continued on to this level of problem domain discarding a bunch of problem domain and arrive at a view of what really simpler than the second system and have the crap workaround in the first we threw away two business this appear costly just analysis and but really the old and plans and are now laughable because so and we threw away previous software using a lot of so it very painful to stop using one component and start using

anyone noticed this odd behavior of application that utilize d3d or opengl when they go to full screen in it applies only when applications go to full screen and then switch back to window or they either shuffle window positions of other applications i am on single monitor or move all the other applications windows to another screen when i am on multiple monitor would take this for granted if there for applications that show this two my question would be what exactly does one need to take care of when writing an application to alleviate these two i am not sure if this problem exists on other platforms besides primary setup concerning this is but i presume this applies to whatever setup you have since it seems to be platform api thing that needs to be taken care here is some more clarification on my problem persists even on same resolution as desktop it does not seem to be related to resolution because seen that even when they are not in the same resolution as when they switch windows on desktop are restored as they once were before the full screen application was it looks like it is a resolution switch windows least does not seem to remember positions and size case of multiple monitor of applications looks like only solution is the one i provided in an answer to the question even though it seems like something os should at least as an api call or still not convinced this is the only there must be an easy way of easy to preserve other application windows sizes and positions when changing to and from full screen game in other resolution than desktop

anyone successfully bound 2 textboxes to one datetime property using the model binding in i tried method but was dissatisfied as this stops the html fields and model properties having the same name the validation could not set the correct css if it current attempt modifies this by removing the valueproviderresult object from the bindingcontext and the adding a new one for the key made up from the date result and a tiem the convention in scotts but i am a little wary of messing around with the bindingcontext object idea is that i can use idateerrorinfo and vab propertycomparisonvalidator to compare 2 datetimes on the model where one needs to be later than the to do this the time element needs to be object in

apologize again for this very surprised at how hibernate really i think it would do all of this and i really even sure what i was trying to as i responded to comments i started to refine the question in my head and was able to then find the answer i was looking thanks to everyone who answer hibernate does this you have in your database table a with a primary key and a table b that has a primary key called that references table you create the following classes class a private string getter and class b extends a private string getter and map them like you can return a and b objects using a simple as in the following query objects b a it does is return a list of objects using the query and then walks through them printing out aproperty from our a class if the class is of type the bproperty from our b hibernate query in this case is automatically polymorphic and will give you a b object when

application appears to have the same characteristics as i wrote a mysql custom storage engine to efficiently solve the it is described your data is laid out on disk as an array of 2m fixed length entries per each containing 3650 rows per of 20 bytes row for one entity per read pattern reads one it is contiguous on disk so it takes 1 seek and read 3650x20 about 80k at maybe so it is done in a fraction of a easily meeting your read update has to write 20 bytes in 2m different places on in simplest case this would take 2m seeks each of which takes about so it would take if you spread the data across 4 disks it could take the places are only 80k in the which means there are 200 such places within a 16mb block disk cache so it could operate at anything up to 200 times reality is somewhere between the storage engine operates on that kind of although it is a little more general purpose than a fixed length could code exactly what i have putting the code into a mysql pluggable storage engine means that you can use mysql to query the data with various report generators the you could eliminate the date and entity id from the stored row they are the array and may be the unique id if you really need it since is and store the 2 values as then your stored row is 6 and you have 700 updates per 16m and therefore a faster inserts and a smaller compare to flat notice that comments general favor flat forget that directories are just indexes implemented by the file system and they are generally optimized for relatively small numbers of relatively large access to files is generally optimized so that it expects a relatively small number of files to be and has a relatively high overhead for open and and for each file that is all of those are relative to the typical use of a file system names as an index for a which i take to be a integer 1 to 2million is in a programming you would use an not a for and you are inevitably going to incur a great deal of overhead for an expensive access path that could simply be an array indeing if you use flat why not use just flat and index on performance of this application is going to be dominated by disk seek the calculations i did above determine the best you can do you can make insert quicker by slowing down select you make them both it matter whether you use a or one that you can add more seeks that you really need and slow it down for indexing its the file system index or a database causes extra compared to array look and these will slow you on benchmark have a table that looks very much like yours almost exactly like one of your it was 64k entities not 2m of and 2788 the table was created in the same insert order that yours will and has the same index a select on one entity takes seconds to inspect the 2788 which is about 130 seeks per second as expected 8 millisec average seek time the select time is going to be proportional to the number of and not much dependent on the number of will be faster on disks with faster seek using a pair of sata2s in raid0 but that making much you the table into entity alter table x order by the same select takes 198 millisecs it is reading the order entity in a single disk the alter table operation took days to complete 182m a few other things the measurements tell your index file is going to be as big as your data it is 3gb for this sample that means my all the index at disk speeds not memory insert rate will decline the insert into the data file is linear but the insert of the key into the index is at 180m records i was getting 153 inserts per which is also very close to the seek it shows that mysql is updating a leaf index block for almost every insert you would expect because it is indexed on entity but inserted in day so you are looking at to do your daily insert of 2m by whatever effect you can get by partition across systems or

application such as this would require a fairly complex data model to account for the different kinds of schools would have different a university might let you add or drop but an elementary school typically does a university needs to schedule courses into whereas an elementary school needs to put students into grades and split grades into classrooms based on available space and design needs to take into consideration all of the requirements it is expected to solve and then implement the more generic you make the program the harder it is to satisfy your the question says the code if you want to write a single program that solves every it will need hundreds of in some cases some schools will require an opposite feature from another for example some schools will need to enforce one teacher per subject or classroom while another school might require multiple the more requirements you expect to the more complex the application industry big applications tend to be written so that they can be a core set of functionality is provided but the application is meant to be changed and customized for a particular this makes it easier to develop because you need to anticipate every in fact you need to anticipate many needs until you have a customer with those but with you are not writing code only most important step is to come up with a data model that is flexible enough to extend later but so flexible that it is impossible to develop the hardest part is usually getting the cardinality of relationships for you might say a class has one then when it turns out a class needs two you have to rewrite a lot of code and fix up a lot of these kinds of changes are annoying and in the end you can always fix mistakes given enough programmer

are a couple of good ways to try and determine unique none of them are exact is why different analytics will report different first is to use a create a cookie for the user for each time frame that you want to track so you could create one that expires in a day and one that expires in a you can then use both of those to track how many unique visitors you of course this is not perfect since people can clear or refuse but it is pretty other way is to track uniques using a combination of the ip address and user agent of the requesting this is probably slightly less accurate since if a company has a good it group lots of internal users will have the same user agent and since they are all coming from the same internal network could have the same ip you are interested in reading more about the different methods there is a great article about it

are absolutely correct when you say that ui is time costly and error great compromise i have found is as realized that a lot of data not can be presented using a simple table as a rather than continuously try to create custom panels and fancy it seem obvious at but quite usable and visually is it so because i was able to create a reusable framework which can accept a collection of concrete models and with little to no effort can render all these models within the so much its adding a toolbar above the my framework can add remove from or edit entries in the using the full power of i can hide and sort as needed by extending various classes only this is find myself reusing a heck of a lot of code every time i want to display and manage new i make extensive use of icons rows or to beautify the i use large icons as a window header to make each screen different and appealing and it always looks like new and different but its always the same code behind lot of work and effort was required at first to do the but now its paying off big can write the gui for an entirely new application with as many as 30 to 50 different consisting of as many screens in a fraction of the time it would take me using the ui would recommend you evaluate and explore this

are different from classes because they are stored on the and not on the that means that every time you call a method with the struct as a copy is created and passed to the that is why large structs are extremely would actively discourage to use structs because it could cause some subtle when you change a field of a its not going to be reflected for the caller you only changed the which is completely different behaviour to the 16 bytes i think is a reasonable maximum size of a but still in most cases it is better to have a if you still want to create a try to make it immutable at

are four style already the first three are there is no penalty for using they are messages to the compiler that data that has been declared one way needs to be accessed a different said this was an but let me access it as if it were a pointing to or said this data was and now i need to pass it to a function that modify but take the parameter as a const from data corruption by casting to the wrong type and trouncing over data a possibility with the most common problem with these casts is data that actually is declared may not be castable to casting something declared to and then modifying it is means not even guaranteed to get a is a construct and has to have a value of these casts is that they specifically say what trying to cast stick out and can be searched for with i would recommend using them over using

are lots of some some tried to put more important differences is a language with a definition and a it is stable in fact has been frozen so it cannot objective caml is an implementation controlled by a small group at it continues to the evolution is managed has many caml has just caml has a number of additional among which the most prominent are probably objects and polymorphic two languages have dramatically different models of record in names of record fields must be where in two different record types in the same scope may have field names in this quirk can make porting from sml to caml a bit are quite a few syntactic libraries and standard functions are dramatically the caml library is very whereas the sml standard basis library is more for function composition is a primitive in not part of the caml the caml string library provide a fold function least not as of version implementations of many of the caml functions are unsafe for very long they blow the type systems are subtly in a type annotation on an expression is accepted if the type with the type of in is accepted only if the type is an of the type of this distinction renders the annotation in caml much less useful in because it is impossible to use a type annotation to insist that an expression is has a much more sane and sensible relationship between interfaces or and implementations or than in sml pretty much anything goes and you have to rely on the programmer to establish good in good conventions are established and enforced by the arithmetic operators are overloaded to apply to both and integer in operators are not operators are notated with an extra the programmer can control the precedence and associtivity of infix in these are determined by the first character of the this restriction limits the benefits of being able to define your own infix

are many differences between how an actual processor handles timing and how a simulation of the processor can handle there is no one way that actual processors deal with you say it is a simple and primitive you need not worry about out of order branch etc it would be good to learn about can simply set the clock interval equal to the interval of the longest you could club all the shorter instructions in one find the longest in the that and set the clock interval to that the remaining long instructions can be allocated an interval which is equal to a multiple of the clock there is no one way to go about

are several plugins for as audited creates a single table for all of the auditable objects and requires no changes to your existing you get on entry per change with the changes stored as a hash in a memo the type of change it is very easy to setup with just a single statement in the application controller specifying which models you want back is up to you but the information is because the information stored is just the changes building the whole object may be difficult due to subsequent bit more complicated to you need a separate table for each object you want to version and you have to add a version id to your existing rollback is a very there are forks on github that provide a hash of changes since last version so you can easily highlight the differences what i my guess is that this is the most popular i have no experience probably give this one a go next time i need versioning as it looks much more	
are several problems in the code sample you posted i will address in has been deprecated for quite some time as it can leave dependent variables in inconsistent states in some see sun answer for more a preferred method of stopping and starting a thread is as volatile thread synchronized void runner new synchronized void thread moribund runner void stuff which can be interrupted if your measurements list is accessed by multiple threads event thread and your user at the same time without any it looks like you have to roll your own you can use a you are creating a new socket every iteration of your sending this is a rather heavyweight and only really make sense if you expect measurements to be extremely infrequent one an hour or either you want a persistent socket that is not recreated every loop of the or you want a one shot runnable you can and which creates a sends all relevant and quick note about using a persistent socket methods which such as cannot be interrupted by and so when you want to stop the you must close the socket as well as calling there is little point in throwing your own exceptions from within a thread unless you expect to catch it somewhere a better solution is to log the error and if it is stop the a thread can stop itself with code like the same context as void stuff which can be interrupted if in this case since the loop will exit if you want to be sure a thread exits with the rest of your no matter a good technique is to call after creation and before you start the this flags the thread as a daemon meaning the vm will ensure that it is automatically destroyed if there are no threads running as if your app best practices with regards to threads should ensure that your app hang or slow down the though they can be quite complex	
are several properties of the attribute that fire off that select after the which is never by and is overridden by isdbgenerated and which generates the behaviour which means the field will be every time you a and linq will also fetch the actual value after resulting in the behaviour you not sure whether this applied to your particular but is it possible to remove these attributes from the field troubling and setting it instead of letting the db set it by at tell linq the db will set it and linq select after solve the actual question of fixing it for only one of the 2 also not sure whether linq stuff is done at runtime through or at compile if the magic is done at you be able to remove the attribute with reflection and add it i really all that i said is i tested all this and had enough experience with my 2

are talking about two separate but intertwined things coding you have several look at each one easily scans an existing tree to find its dependencies and create a configure script that will run under almost any kind of the configure script allows the user to control the build behavior as well as doing checks to ensure that the system can compile the generates a file a which programs can include to work around portability for if is not use forks personally use autoconf on many it usually takes people some time to get used to it does save can have makefiles inherit some of the values that configure finds without using providing a short template that describes what programs will be built and what objects need to be linked to build makefiles that adhere to gnu coding standards can automatically be this includes dependency handling and all of the required gnu people find this i prefer to write my own is a very cool tool for simplifying the building and installation of shared libraries on any sometimes i use other times when just building static link i do it by are other options see stackoverflow question to autoconf and you really should use kind of portable build configuration system if you release your code to the what you use is up to gnu software is known to build and run on almost you might not need to adhere to such sometimes extremely recommend giving autoconf a try if writing software for posix if you need documentation and update your fear m4 there is always the macro plenty of or drop in write your own or use autoconf is far too often confused with they are two separate

are using mediawiki inhouse for our software and hardware it looks like granting revoking to parts of the documentation for our external users project partners is not easy to how could we control read access to some areas of the documentation based on user or role access i am asking this because i like to go back to the of documentation storing office documents in dozens of different and nobody has a clue where they so if there is no way to give users limited access only to their product i am afraid that management will drop the whole mediawiki solution and introduce something and could mean we have to transfer all content to a new formatting and hyperlinks would be lost thanks for the comments and interesting informations are available at example there is a hiddenwiki patch which seems to be in active located at documentation with external user access

are using to connect to a sql 2005 and doing a number of and selects in we changed one of the updates to be inside a transaction however it appears to the entire table when we do regardless of the isolationlevel we set on the behavior that i seem to see is you have no transactions then an all out fight getting dead you have a few transactions then they win all the time and block all others out you have a few transactions and you set something like nolock on the rest then you get transactions and nothing is because every statement has an isolationlevel regardless of this transactions selects is my understanding

are you allowed an ftp server and no http or ssh concerned about plain ftp certainly providing and sftp requires ssh so you could use to synchronize with repositories works much better with git than as most version control tasks can be utilized over http without much fuss why not just run a nightly checkout and throw it up on an http server that everyone can take their patches and only merge into the general working svn repository when you like the patches you not to beat a dead but git is more than worth the investment it takes to please consider that setup is and you should stand up to the thoughtless bureaucrats implemented it and try and find a workable solution where you can share at least somewhat directly some version control even if not repositories that your groups use as their primary source control

been working on an app that handles this exact behavior for the last 2 months or it has a small subset of functions which are online only and a large set of functionality that is using sqlite for local storage as suggested here with a modified version of the sqlitepersistentobjects the base version of sqlitepersistentobjects is not thread safe so watch out if you are using out objectiverecord for a thread safe alternative but be prepared to dig into the if you are willing to develop for the sdk then core data is another possibility for a sqlite overall architecture is simple enough i have modeled local storage using sqlite and remote interaction using against a rails app and rest it can use either xml or json for data an object is modified locally the change is first saved to the sqlite database record for that object and then added to a queue which is serialized and stored in the local sqlite db as queue can then be processed at any there is a connection available any queued local changes are deserialized and added to an nsoperationqueue which then processes them in the order to make this all work subclassed nsoperation so that it can support several types of remote queue operations delete essentially using objective resource to make the remote nice thing about using nsoperationqueue and nsoperation is that they handle the background threading for you so highly recommend having a look at the apple docs for those classes and also at the apple the application loads there is a bit of remote checking done and processed in the background to pull down the latest data although to be honest i am still changing the way this behaves a a quick overview of what had to deal with so it helps a

behavior is so bizarre that i even know how best to ask the the following code class foo private bool protected void throw new the visual studio debugger to an application executing a version of this code and stepping through the execution of step into or step the block is evaluated and the exception is setting a watch on the i can see that the value of is at the beginning of the method and does not change as i step the assignment more the exception is thrown if i continue execution though things still working came across this when trying to figure out why nunit test cases were working when run using resharper from within visual but fail when run within the the nunit i attached the debugger to the nunit set some breakpoints on the tests that were unexpectedly found places where variables being set properly which should be set based on the variable which is somewhat of a flag indicating whether stuff is dirty or and thus noticed the strange behavior where changing exception throwing thing was added later and verifies i was using the right compiled how about what could possibly explain the what circumstances can an assignment in not change a	
being i have ended up having to make the app register a callback with the the purpose of the callback is to process the data after the driver reads it from the the driver manages the memory allocates invokes the callback and finally frees the callback only has read permission on the the app should ideally just copy the contents of the buffer to its own memory and exit from the callback right then it is free to process the data when and how it updated the documentation to make it clear to uses of the app callback that it is assumed when the callback the memory should no longer be considered if the callback is used any other the behavior is	
beleive that you also need to include the the header file that the ide puts in your project when you create been awhile since i wrote any using vs but if i remember i ran into a bunch of issues if i the stdafx header adds a bunch of compiler directives that are required by the vs 2008

believe that the more you start to develop using design find more and more often where composition is going to be favored over i actually believe in the design book that composition over is one of the primary design example of being able to mock up parts of the composition for testing is probably one of the best examples although the basic principle in design patterns is to favor composition over that mean that there design patterns which utilize inheritance where it is another basic example is the decorator where you are coding towards an abstract superclass this is for type matching and not for implementing an

believe that your algorithm essentially makes your cache memory what you are seeing is the effect of of reference between the three essentially because each thread is operating on a different section of data that is widely separated from the others you are causing cache misses as the data section for one thread replaces that for another thread in your if your program was constructed so that the threads operated on sections of data that were smaller that they could all be kept in or closer together that all threads could use the same see a performance as it is i suspect that your slow down is because a lot of memory references are having to be satisifed from main memory instead of from your	
believe the idea of is more about when you open and close the not about getting performance idea is that a session will start a transaction before your code is ever business logic your framework has full access to the database until the possible transaction is committed for instead of having to do it each time idea of is important so that you can mix web frameworks and lazy loading of if a getter method is called while rendering your data after your code has been and you closed the you lazily load that

best and the easiest solution is to hire a technical writer who has knowledge of software this would make the documentation process a log easier and technical writers are considered as the best option as they are far more knowledgeable when it comes to writing the development process in simple english that can be understood by between codes are often used to briefly explain what the happens next in the program and cannot fully be considered as however they will come handy when a technical writer prepares a developers	
best answer is that it depends on the specifics of your your skillset in cf and in stronger in design and what is the code expected to do you expect to do things that are easier to do in are you reusing business logic from elsewhere already written in i set out with the intention of breaking the code for the app in to two introduce complexity until

best bet is to create a property if you in the base class and provides a sort of base something virtual string get return property could stay the or change to something like and you could combine and to form a complete the this probably the best way to go about what is the purpose of naming these it looks to me like using a command pattern in image manipulation and either setting up a chain of actions to or want to keep a chain of actions to such a system would be better suited to a linked list which you could display in some sort of showing the action the name of the or the as defined and the series in which they would be far as your need to use the name to instantiate the not quite sure if this is truly your only two options would be a factory pattern or using reflection on either the name of the class or a custom attribute value could also be used for providing the if if going to be instantiating them the away from guess this is a roundabout way of saying it all depends on how this needs to have to provide more concrete and comprehensive information for a correspondingly concrete and comprehensive	
best bet is to report stuff like this from another either based on transformations from your production database into an olap database will make the time delay go or at least a periodic static snapshot will make the delay not matter you can turn off locking because nothing will report readers will be a lot happier with reports run five minutes apart that give the same or 12 hours benefit you will appreciate the most is that life will be

best practice is to write code that others can read and update first form is questionable because it follow the forms that most php developers are used else or or short code else short code or short code short code that this is entirely about standard and necessarily make only about what other developers are used to second more so good because it makes it easy for another programmer to make this code code code c by another this the other programmer added but forgot to wrap the whole block in this will cause you can defend against this by simply wrapping your and blocks in	
best solution of them all would be to get the paging capablilities into your data access so that if you need page 3 you only get those ten records and not the entire that way you could also use a repeater to render the without having to extend it with paging capabilities just add another repeater at the bottom that loops out the page numbers as if this is not the easiest way would probably be to manually configure the gridview to render the way you want it to as close as been a while since i worked with a but the names i show below are at least close enough for you to find the correct ones with intellisense in your add a section betweeen the within that you should be able to specify each field you want to and the order you want them

biggest difference is that ruby actually has a syntax for and easy to things at runtime if you say it will intern that for even though referring to it by name in your internally just a pointer in the symbol if you compare just a not a like c really have a way to say simply a new symbol for at you can do it implicitly at by defining a but really its only since c has no syntax for if you want to be able to say balloon in your program but be able to compare it with a single machine you use enums it takes only one character to make a so you can use it for all kinds of things hash

bit of a but sql have different options for network including shared named pipes and you can set the configuration for both server and clients the appropriate using sql server configuration native client will often use named which often will not work over a wan as it uses broadcasts for name resolution may need more ports if ssms tries to connect via named pipes it may not be able to resolve the server whereas if sqlcmd uses it will be able other the first place i would look would be in sql server configuration manager both the server and the try disabling everything other than or change the provider order so is at the you can leave shared memory right at the top and enabled if you it is handy for local machine

both object oriented languages for the jvm that have lambdas and closures and interoperate with other than extremely is a language in not only the sense that it is dynamically typed but that it supports dynamic is a language in that it is statically typed and has virtually no dynamic beyond the awkward stuff you can do in static type system is substantially more uniform and sophisticated than is syntactically influenced by java but semantically influenced more by languages like is syntactically influenced by both ruby and it is semantically influenced more by and a very obscure oo language called has multiple dispatch due to the way it handles java is single dispatch but has sml inspired pattern matching to deal with some of the same kinds of problems that multiple dispatch is meant to where multiple dispatch can only dispatch on runtime pattern matching can dispatch on runtime or pattern matching also includes syntactically pleasant variable hard to overstress how pleasant this single feature alone makes programming in scala and groovy support a form of multiple inheritance with mixins scala calls them supports both partial function application and currying at the language groovy has an awkward method for doing partial function does direct tail recursion i believe groovy important in functional programming but less important in imperative scala and groovy are eagerly evaluated by scala supports groovy does not must be emulated with has a generalization of list comprehensions found in other languages monad comprehensions plus a bit somewhere between do and has no concept of inner etc it uses singleton objects groovy uses the static does not have built in selection of arithmetic operators in quite the way that groovy in scala you can name methods very has the elvis operator for dealing with scala programmers prefer to use option types to using but easy to write an elvis operator in scala if you want there are there are damn and then there are the computer language benchmarks game ranks scala as being between substantially faster than groovy from twice to 93 times as while retaining roughly the same source sure there are many differences that i but hopefully this gives you a there a competition between of but not as much as you might real competition is jruby and going to my crystal ball is as cracked as anybody

can only tell if a tcp socket is by attempting to send this is because the design of the protocol is such that supposed to allow for temporary outages between if you connect from a via r1 via r2 via r3 to b and send data for a while and then stop sending you could unplug and neither a nor b would notice if you then plugged and and then tried to send data between a and b then things would and never you tried to send data when was disconnected then after all the tcp level get an error some operating systems may be able to alert you to the fact that your local network adapter currently connected and you could use that to say no longer connected to my but i advise having your peers know when connections are is important then either use an application level message to occasionally send data between the peers or use tcp personally go for the ping of course all that is assuming that you want to know if you can still send data on a after told when the client is no longer sending because your reads will return 0 bytes and you know when it disconnects its send side because your writes will you also know when you shutdown either the send or recv side of your own end of the guess i should have stuck with initial gut reaction response of

classes are fine as long as used in the right methods that are methods do not modify they merely transform the input good examples of this are things like these sorts of things are useful and make for terser i have with statics are if you have static dependencies are consider the static class public static void public static void public static void static class private static public static new graphicsformat in do something to create loading classes for all supported formats or some other contrived public static texture return how do we know that resourceloader is valid at this var texture return public static cleanup code at you cannot tell what initialisation steps must be carried out by looking at a you must delve into the class to find its dependencies and initialise things in the correct in this it needs the resourceloader to be initialised before now scale up this dependency nightmare and you can probably guess what will imagine trying to maintain code where there is no explicit order of contrast this with dependency injection with instances in that case the code even if the dependencies are not if you use statics that modify like a house of you never know who has access to and the design tends to resemble a spaghetti and just as using statics ties a program to a specific static code is the antithesis of designing for testing code that is riddled with statics is a a static call can never be swapped for a test double you use testing frameworks specifically designed to mock out static so a static system causes everything that uses it to be an instant integration statics are fine for some things and for small tools or throwaway code i discourage their beyond they are a bloody nightmare for good design and ease of a good article on the

concentrating my answer on trying to avoid this leads to two the people using the system will therefore be actively trying to contravene your check and your goal is only to detect the presence of a not to extract the complete this solution would look different if your goal is something think your best bet is going to be with the there are the cctlds and the comparitively small list of these need to be prefixed by a dot and suffixed by either a slash or some word as others have this going to be no way to get without disallowing the legitimate tried it or all of that this would be my this will will of course break as soon as people start obfuscating their replacing with dot again assuming spammers are your goal if they start doing that sort of their rates are going to drop another couple of orders of magnitude toward the set of people informed enough to deobfuscate a url and the set of people uninformed enough to visit spam sites i a miniscule this solution should let you detect all urls that are to the address whilst keeping collateral damage to a bare

constructor is a defined method on a type which takes a specified number of parameters and is used to create and initialize an object initializer is code that runs on an object after a constructor and can be used to succinctly set any number of fields on the object to specified the setting of these fields occurs the constructor is would use a constructor without the help of an object initializer if the constructor sufficiently set the initial state of the an object initializer however must be used in conjunction with a the syntax requires the explicit or implicit use and of a constructor to create the initial you would use an object initializer when the constructor does not sufficiently initialize the object to your use and a few simple field property sets

control will not rebind to the viewstate data if you set the to or an empty the article i linked below has an excellent explanation as to what is going on is once you have set the to or an empty string the control takes this as an indication from the consumer of the control that they do not wish to bind any data at all viewstate the control checks the prior to binding and if it is an empty string then it does not in its datasource datasourceid

cookie needs to be generated because the session binds the client to the and therefore the token exchange must go from server to client at some it would not really be useful to generate the cookie because the client the untrusted remote is possible to have the cookie set during an ajax to the server the an ajax call is simply an http and any http response by the server can set a so it is possible to initiate a session in response to an ajax and the cookie will be stored by the client as you can use ajax to do the logging in process in the same was as you could have just relied on a post from a form on the the server will see them the same and if the server sets a cookie the browser will store javascript never needs to be able to know the value of the cookie it is better for security if it which can be achieved using the cookie extension honored by recent note that further http calls from the client to the whether they are normal page requests or they are ajax will include that cookie even if marked httponly and the browser honors that your script does not need to be of the mentioned using ssl that prevents others from being able to read information in so very handy for preventing plain text transmission of the password or other important it can also help guard against network based though it does not make you immune to everything that csrf can throw and it does not at all protect you against the likes of session fixation or so i would avoid thinking of ssl as a fix all if you use i sort of combined that the cookie is set by the server in its http response yes it is to make it compatible you still need to ensure logging in is possible when ajax is this may require implementing an alternative that is seen only when there is no javascript or if ajax now in become a lot more realistic to rely on ajax support in would not change the there would be no need for except that i have seen hidden iframes used before to ajax before ie make asyncronous calls to the however you do it the server setting the and the client will accept and return the cookie whether it does it by ajax or the most whether you use ajax or not does not affect the security all that much as all the real security happens on the server and to the server an ajax call is just like a not to be therefore need to be aware of issues such as and as well as issues affecting the session as a whole like and just as much as you would if you were using no the issues really change when using ajax i that you may make more mistakes with a technology if less familiar with it or more updated july

depends a lot on how going to use the existing if grabbing the source and modifying it to do new got a bigger problem than if just reusing existing libraries or you are taking code and changing you need permission from the original copyright holders to distribute your changes to their code under the gplv3 which you can either try to get explicitly them an or maybe already have apache license for gpl if the code was gpled with the your any later or under a bsd you should be fine just reusing existing programs as often fine anyway though when you redistribute something under gplv2 or gplv3 often be required to distribute everything people need to actually use the as well as the code the more the other software is throw out the gplv2 stuff and put in some other implementation from someone else the better off you are on that

depends on the regular expression itself if it is efficient or what it makes inefficient is and to avoid the regular expression has to be as distinct as take the regular expression as an example and apply it to the string the algorithm will first match the literal in to the in next the expression will be in the normal greedy where multipliers are expanded to the it will match to the whole rest in than the last literal in will be but as the end of the string is already reached and a mulpliplier is in the algorithm will try backtracking to match the whole the match of will be decreased by one character and the algorithm tries to comply the rest of the but the in match the in so will be decreased by one more character until it matches the empty string is repeated zero and the in matches the in you can applied to needs 6 backtracking approaches for until the whole regular expression but if we alter the regular expression and make it distinct by using there is be no backtracking necessary and the regular expression can be matches within the first if you now consider using lazy modifiers to tell that this rules apply to every both the greedy and lazy the difference is instead of first expanding the match to the maximum and than doing backtracking by decreasing the match one character at a time the lazy modifiers will first be expanded to the minimum match and than be increased one character at a

does the but you should keep in mind that does guarantee uniqueness if you have multiple processes running phusion multiple or a because you might get this sequence of events order is a gets a request to create a new user with the name b does the same a validates the uniqueness of by asking the db if that name exists yet and the db says the name exist b does the same thing and gets the same a submits the statement for the new record and you have a database constraint requiring uniqueness for that process b will submit the statement for the new record and with a ugly server exception that comes back from the sql if you do not have a database the insert will succeed and you now have two rows with as the also and in the rails on rails 3rd its really guarantee that column values will be all it can do is verify that no column has the same value as that in the record being validated at the time the validation is possible for two records to be created at the same each with the same value for a column that should be and for both records to pass the most reliable way to enforce uniqueness is with a also with way this commonly happens is accidental from a web page when creating a new this is a hard one to solve because what the user will get back is the second error and it will make them think their registration when in reality it the best way found to prevent this is just to use javascript to try to prevent

done a brief google around and found nothing but i feel i ought to not really expecting there to be but would rather ask a question with no answers now than ask the question when all going wrong and discover that everyone knew about a make overall life easier to madexcept about to take a app written in d5 nativedb to connect to and port it to eventually to turn it into a console app a present gui is little more than than a glorifed button and an activity a classic tserversocket listening on a specified port and to do various things when clients not expecting any huge problems with the nativedb side of but i wondered if there were any changes between d5 and d2007 as far as tserversocket use blocking indy etc just tserversocket from the scktcomp straight out of the d5 enterprise not looking to change the code significantly unless there is something very wrong with tserversocket under gotchas moving tserversocket app from d5 to

done one answer on but now like to add another from a broader sounds like the thing that make this a hard problem is that each driver is basing their actions on mental predictions of what other drivers are going to for instance when i am driving i can tell when a car is likely to pull in front of even before he based on the way he is lining himself up with the gap between me and the car in he in turn can tell that i have seen him from the fact that backing off to make room for so its ok to pull a good driver picks up lots of these subtle and its very hard to the first step is to find out what aspects of real driving are not included in the failed and work out how to put them all models are but some models are suspect that the answer is going to involve giving each simulated driver one or more mental models of what each other driver is going to this involves running the planning algorithm for driver 2 using several different assumptions that driver 1 might make about the intentions of driver meanwhile driver 2 is doing the same about driver is the kind of thing that can be very difficult to add to an existing especially if it was written in a conventional because the planning algorithm may well have side even if its only in the way it traverses a data but a functional language may well be able to do the interdependence between drivers probably means there is a fixpoint somewhere in which lazy languages tend to do better

drawing offscreen to a created using then later generating a from it with and drawing that onto my view in also drawing some other stuff on top of that this is an exercise in isolating different levels of variability and all works fine when all running on the main however one of the motivations for splitting this out this way was so that the offscreen part could be run on a background thread i had thought should be ok since not rendering to an onscreen when i do this the resulting image is checked over the and placed judicious to verify that everything is happening in the right next step is to boil this down to the simplest code that reproduces the issue find some silly thing missing and fix at which point have some code to post here if but i first wanted to check here that not going down the wrong path with i find anything in my travels around the googlesphere that sheds light either way but a friend did mention that he ran into a similar issue while trying to resize images in a background thread suggesting there may be some general limitation for the responses so if nothing else they have told me that at least not alone in not having an answer for this which was part of what i wanted to find at this point going to put the extra work into getting the simplest possible example and may come back with some code or more in the meantime keep any ideas coming point to bring a couple of people have used the term with respect to it should be noted that there are two types of thread safety in this of the api itself ie can it be used at all from more than one thread state and other issues such as strtok are common reasons that an api might not be thread safe of individual operations can multiple threads interact with the same objects and resources through api without application level suspect that mention so far has been of the first but would appreciate if you could i got it all executive summary is that the problem was with rather than bitmap contexts my background just before i drew into the bitmap i was doing some preparation on some other it turns out the calls to those other objects where leading to setneedsdisplay being called on some separating the part that did that out to the main thread it now all works for anyone who hits this question wondering if they can draw to a bitmap context on a background the answer is you can the caveats that have been presented here and in the core can you draw to a bitmap context from a background

easy to get a the getting started you have an ec2 account you can enable mapreduce and have a sample application up and running in less than 10 minutes using the aws management did the word count sample which returns a count of each word contained in about 20 mb of you can provision up to 20 instances to run though i just used 2 instances and the job completed in about 3 job returns a 300 kb alphabetized list of words and how often each word appears in the sample really like that mapreduce jobs can be written in my choice of or the process was painless and and the interface gives good feedback on the status of your instances and the job aware since aws charges for a full hour when an instance is and since the mapreduce instances are automatically terminated at the end of the job the cost of multiple job flows can add up if i create a job flow that uses 20 instances and returns results in 15 and then the job flow 3 more be charged for 80 hours of machine time even though i only had 20 instances running for 1

easy way to map this is turn it into a many to one and store the current id on the vehicle i understand this might be a schema way to trick this would be to create a view that would essentially be the vehicle table plus it would pull the current this way you have to change the you would then map to the view instead of the not sure if defining your own loader would work in this case but its one more option to understand your the easiest way would to be modify the schema and the application to add this additional column one way to fake it would be with a so for join owner on is assume here the current owner has a null end now you change your mapping to map to the view instead of the yes this is a hack but it will am assuming you still need owner to be mapped within another option would be to add a where filter on the class mapping to filter where end date is option you have is to load all the owners and push the business rule that defines the current owner to the application your object might look owner get return null if your using a nullable set

error is never as as examples error codes for program if you have an error that is do not throw an reading a you may throw an exception for not but never throw one for of you you can never write simple always wrapping code in exception and forget exceptions are very this is especially important in big so important at all in your desktop be very careful with exception you may think ok to have an then derive a from then for your smtp but unless you hold generic data in the base you will always have to catch every type of exception in that if you put the reason for the smtp error in your you must catch it if you only catch you will not have access to the a good workaround for this problem is to have a string and an int member in the base exception class and only use even for the derived unfortunately only offers a string people say that doing this means you might as well only have a single exception especially as you will always catch the base class type you do use exceptions you must take the trouble to populate them with more data than you would with an error with you must handle them immediately or they get lost in the with an it may get caught many levels away from where it was thrown like in is and gets an exception 2 levels in from unless you specify the error to be specific to the code in you may think it was thrown from the but seen code where an exception was handled many levels down the call it was a to this especially applies to oo given you enough to think the simple truth of the matter is that style means nothing in error practicality is if you have to put log statements everywhere an error can then do it matters a lot more that you can see where the code went wrong what data was being worked than you have a elegant exception hierarchy or littered your code with exception you cannot easily trace the your error handling code is are use but think about what do not misuse or overuse a misused exception is worse than no error handling at all you can grab a crash dump and view the unhandled exception to find the error in with an exception that is eaten and found over the years that the biggest assistant to debugging is write write lots of

examples you gave should have absolutely no performance difference in and i doubt they would differ in python confusing it with a different i i i i latter is faster in some architectures because the act of decrementing the variable will set the zero which can then be checked in a giving you the loop iteration and the conditional in one the former example needs to perform an explicit comparison or a subtraction to set a and then jump based on most of the time the compiler can optimise the first case into the second if it sees that the variable is effectively a and on some combinations instructions may be generated that make the first method more like the things like this are only worth trying if you have a tight inner loop that your profiler is telling you is but never notice the difference if there even is

executing a number of sql as a batch and then getting all of the result sets back in a the way that my code is currently put the first result set gets now that i know i could simply throw in another statement outside of my loop that grabs the first however wondering if there is a more elegant solution to this is some sudo code of whats going stuff that returns a batch of while if things with the i would have expected that advances you to the first result the first time you call which is what seems to however what it actually seems to do is bring you to the second result on the first am i misunderstanding how expected to use this or are you really expected to do some like the stuff that returns a batch of deals with the row in the the very first if things with the deals with the rest of the while if exact same things with the this not pretty strikes me as rotten programming but i see a way around does anyone know of a more elegant solution to best to loop over a batch of results with a

far as i strings are immutable in i kind of understand that means if you string1 string is destroyed and you get a reference to a new string what happens if you have the same string in different places around your have a string hash assigned for identifying several so for example a is identified by a hash value of the properties of that that way easy for me to check to for each hash is computed separately all the properties are taken into account so that to separate instances can be equal even if they differ on some question how does delphi handles those if i compute to separate hashes to the same 10 byte length what do i two memory blocks of 10 bytes or two references to the same memory a change is composed by some properties read from the database and is generated by an individual the tchange class has a gethash method that computes a hash based on some of the values not resulting on a other threads receive the change and have to compare it to previously processed changes so that they process the same hence the hash as they have separate two different strings are trying to determine if be a real improvement to change from string to something like a 128 bit hash or be just wasting my version of delphi is delphi delphi strings

finding it very hard to read your regex with all the if interpreting this dialect of regex what saying is what verbose pcre would obvious problem that jumps out is that it starts with a lookbehind lookbehind is troublesome enough as it is not supported in many regex but then compounded by being followed by a liberal match character with negative is for a processor to the combination pretty much kills any possible optimisation it might have been able to for every character in the file it has to backtrack to the beginning of of previous to see if the lookbehind then step forward to the end of looking for could help it by using only a or simply forgetting about the lookarounds and including the whole string in the which will be more efficient to at the expense of needing a bit more to pick out the groups interested as always with this kind of clippy looks like parsing xml with you like use a real xml parser because regex is inherently incapable of parsing just soldier on making unreadable complex regexes which still show me this tip

first example is functionally the same as the second this syntax should be avoided for several first it is much easier to accidentally get a cross join when using this syntax especially when there are mulitple joins in the if you see a lot of this type of query with the keyword you probably have someone who is trying to fix the cross the left and right join syntax using the older style is deprecated and will no longer be it work correctly now sometimes it misinterprets the outer join and sends back the wrong results so any queries you have using or in the where clause should immediately be ansi standard joins are easier to understand and an understanding of joins is one of the most critical basic skills that anyone querying any relational database needs to it has been my experience that some people who use the older style really understand joins and how they work and thus write queries that do not actually do what they

frequently frustrated by the amount of logging i have to include in my code and it leads me to wonder if a better way of doing know if this has been done or if someone has come up with a better idea but i was wondering is there a way anyone knows of to a logger into an application such that it passively monitors the thread and quietly logs processes as they occur without having to do things void string object process myprocess with int d returned value catch exception occurred during process would be great is if i could say to my would then monitor everything that goes on inside of that method including passed in arguments along with method calls and values passed into those exceptions that occur anyone implemented something like this in the could it even is logging in this fashion just a pipe love to design something that would do but i just even know where of i want to reinvent the wheel if already been it would be great if someone could point me in the right suggestions would be gratefully i thought comment on an answer which queried as to the level of detail required in the it is frequently required that configurable levels of logging be provided such that if the configuration specifies detailed logging then everything is whereas if critical logging is configured then only certain information is logged along with if fatal logging is configured then only information which causes the application to die would be would something like this be configurable or would aop require 3 or 4 different builds depending on the number of logging frequently use 4 passive logging possible in

give you the ability to combine two bad traits in one wrong in pretty much every singleton gives access to an guarantee that no more than one object of this type ever be one is globals are generally we should never make objects globally accessible unless we need two may sound like it makes but think about when was the last time you created a new object instead of referencing an existing since this is tagged use an example from that do you often accidentally you intended to course we need protection against this because that kind of error just if it the correct response is to go home and sleep for hours and hope you feel only one object is simply create one if one object should be globally make it a but that mean it should be impossible to create other instances of one instance is constraint really protect us against likely but it make our code very hard to refactor and because quite often we find out that we did need more than one we have more than one we have more than one configuration we do want several our unit tests may want to be able to create and recreate these objects every to take a common a singleton should be used if and only we need the traits it we global access is because globals are generally we to prevent anyone from creating more than one instance of a class sounds to me like a design the only reason i can see for this is if creating two instances would corrupt our application state probably because the class contains a number of static members or similar in which case the obvious answer is to fix that it depend on being the only you need global access to an make it a like but constrain the number of instances that can be you absolutely positively need to constrain the number of instances of a class to and there is no way creating two instances can ever be handled then enforce but make it globally accessible as you do need both then make it a and let me know what you need that because having a hard time imagining such a

graphs model intuitively model computer networks and the often nodes will represent or while edges represent connections between these any data structure that makes use of pointers to link data together is making use of a graph of some this includes tree structures and linked lists which are used all the and trying to find shortest or longest paths from some location to a destination makes use of this can include pathing like you see in an application like google or calculating paths for ai characters to take in a video and many other similar a common problem in ai is to find some goal that satisfies a list of for for a university to set course it needs to make sure that certain courses that a professor teaching two courses at the same that the lectures occur during certain and so constraint satisfaction problems like this are often modeled and solved using graphs can be used to model atoms and molecules for studying their interaction and structure among other

guessing referring to the following line as the one with the confusing 1 break this represents an initial index into the array and i is simply the current so this is effectively iterating the array starting at index 1 this is calculating the number of bits to shift by and is doing so based on the current this number will start at size and will decrease as the loop 1 this shifts the value at by the specified number of dos a bitwise or expression on the bytes that are still available once the iterated value has been

had this subject before but i find anything your needs might where no sanity check one might be required in the if you change your public fields to this breaks binary every client who uses your would have to is because it potentially costs a lot of properties from the beginning avoids this this even counts for code that is not part of a because you never the code if highly might prove useful so you want to refactor it to a this refactoring process is obviously made much easier if you are already using properties in place of writing public properties is easy in because you can just use the saving you quite a bit of datatype myproperty implement the necessary backing field and code for will add a personal behaviour in this regard is somewhat the compiler could just change public fields to properties on the thus avoiding the vb6 already did this for classes and i see absolutely no reason for and not to do the perhaps someone on the compiler teams could comment on

happens because always queries the this is a design they do it this because else they would have to execute the query against the against the local cache and then merge the as one of the developers pointed out in a blog remeber where they were unable to handle this you can imagine there are a lot of corner an edge cases you have to handle you could just find a id you created created by someone else in the this would force you to be prepeared to handle conflicts on every maybe they could have made methods to querry the local cache and methods to query the but that is not to may have a look at lazy loading for entity this replaces the normal code generator and you get entites that populate their related entiy collections and entity references automaticaly on this avoids all and you can query the collections because they are always implicitly but this solution is not there are some for if you create a new entity and access a collection of releated you will get an exception because the code is unable to retrieve the releated entities from the there is also an issue concerning data binding and may be some more i am not aware good thing is that you get the source code and are able to fix the issues yourself and i am going to examin the first issue if i find some but i am quite sure that it will not be that easy to because i exspect some case were just not hitting the database if the entity has just been created is not the exspected

hard to give a single all encompassing answer but the high level approach is at this is the approach prioritize your goals and then try to identify the costs of reaching those your costs will essentially boil down to you want whatever is working to keep if you have something that is and there is no good reason to rewrite keep some of your existing code needs updating to do its then you are looking at maintenance at this point you need to determine if a rewrite will improve maintenance costs enough to be worth forget to subtract testing and debugging of new bugs because there will be new dismiss working code just because it is your existing code is sufficiently you can usually chip away at it one piece at a rewrite the high maintenance components you will be doing new development in then you should be fine working with com components until you have enough justification to replace

has always been the behavior as how else will the compiler build your project if it does not have a reference to all the assemblies that are referenced by your project are required for your application to you are using types from those assemblies and without those types your application cannot more importantly without those types your application cannot consider that every assembly that you reference was built in the same manner as your assembly and requires that all referenced assemblies be present and accounted this does create a chain reaction that can be annoying but the end result is that once you are executing your the clr has all the assemblies that it needs to run your

have a class of data with a very large number of binary to be i am concerned with how to model this data despite the internal efficiencies of storing as my programming spidey senses are tingling at creating a table with 151 addition to other will not be a large number of 1000 and once sent into production will not change very thought of categorizing my data into disjoint subclasses and creating separate tables but splitting the properties in this manner is impracticable and even if possible certainly would not map effectively with the data the other issue is like to keep all the data together and avoid field row i have also considered using some custom binary format but this is not workable as the key field in my data is used as foreign keys in other will make heavy use of where clauses to extract relevant considered using multiple longs or int fields but rejected this as unworkable since i know of no or functions in sql and as noted classification of the properties is not to mention other major software engineering issues this will be using my question here is do i just make a table with a huge number of fields or are there other methods compatible with the relational structures with a large number of bit

have a couple of one way is that you could say that a word is characters and then take a substring of that append the to the end and display or you could run though the string and count the number of if you assume that there is only one space between each of the then the 100th space will be after then 100th append the ellipsis and you are one has better performance would likely depend upon how the functions are most likely the substring operation is going to be faster than counting the the performance difference might be negligible so unless you are doing this a counting spaces would likely be the most accurate way to just as a the average length of a word in the english language

have a project involving a web voting the current values and related data is stored in several historical data will be an important aspect of this project so also created audit tables to which current data will be moved to on a regular find this strategy highly even if i only archive data on a daily the number of rows will become huge even if only 1 or 2 users make updates on a given next alternative i can think of is only storing entries that have this will mean having to build logic to automatically create a view of a given this means less stored but considerable final idea is a bit less since the historical data will be for reporting no need for web users to have quick thinking that my db could have no historical data in db only represents current the entire db could be loaded into objects of is relatively and then serialized to something like xml or these files could be diffed with the previous day and in svn could do this for when i want the data for a given past the system has to retrieve the version for that day and deserialize into this is obviously a costly operation but performance is not so much a concern considering using linq for this which i think would simplify the serialization procedure would have to be pretty organized for the diff to work approach would you controlled database with efficient use of

have a question not necessarily specific to any platform or api but more specific to interactions in code between game is a good say the player and a death animation that must finish before the object is this is typical for many cases where some animation has to finish before continuing with what ever action that would normally how would you go about doing question is about the control and logic of how would you design a system which is capable of driving the animation but at the same time implement custom problem that typically is that the game logic and animation data become that the animation has to callback into code or somehow contain meta data for duration of animation typically even more so a is when an which has to trigger some other say after spawn a custom this tend to result in deep nesting of code and a bomb with a timer would be en example of both logic and animation where both things but i want to keep them as separate as what would you do to keep animation and code two separate been trying out and a dsl might be the way to that would allow the animation or to express certain things in a presumably safe manner which would then go into the content and

have a websphere java ee application that requires for which looking to use work would require its own view onto data coming from a most of this would be but it would still need to go to the database to get we anticipate that the duration of the overall work of all of these threads would be enough time for underlying data to be a result we need to ensure isolation of the data in use by the application and queried during the course of the seems that the only way to ensure this is to have a transaction and use xa but like to avoid this complexity if at all and are looking for ideas or any to what degree at do work components support container managed perhaps i just meant our thought was that xa transactions and messaging incur overhead that work components sharing a transaction could dataset being operated on would be distinct rows of each needing calculations done on whereas these could be divided up onto different threads operating on the comparative memory overhead of copying off a queue seems would you tens to of milliseconds per also focusing on improving the logic processing as a separate i need to use xa transactions when what is required that all threads have a consistent view of data in a single my answer to this is that each thread would require its own jpa entitymanager and would need xa in order to coordinate their if i can do this without xa then so much the management with

have previously worked in the game and did something along these to my no one ever bothered cracking the score submitting way it was done was a random number as a salt the score using math based on the salt a checksum to make sure there was no tempering on the score the score and any required data to the score submitting the validate that the score has not been tempered using the the score is then insert it into the reject you you might log ip adresses of the submitters of scores violating the checksums a policy of three bad and add a script to ban them from accessing the server for but this will probably not be required unless someone wants to crack your code that the hashing checksuming was made using a custom did not need something very it was made using a computation on the salt and the some simple math operations like multiplications and a simple algorithm maths for the say your user has a score of generate a random number as a salt of pad with should use something a bit more complex but it is just an our the crypted score would be for the lets say you want to have a value of as a add all the numbers of your crypted score you calculate the value of your checksum for this of crypted score numbers we have the following salt crypted score checksum make a request to the sending as a score you can divide by giving and validate the checksum using the same function as the checksum then numbers have been could probably end up with something much more but it should do the

having a problem where a collection of objects being accessed correctly when run on a thread from a i can run my unit tests fine in vs2008 but when i attach the debugger to the service i can clearly see that not starting at the 1 based index but instead at the 0 based tried everything that i can think of to isolate this and the only difference is that in a service and not running as a command line app for i debug the function i also get a evaluation message which i do not when i run it on my unit know that arrays normally start from always assumed this but today i found this bug and have determined that even though i thought that it started from the debugger shows that starts at when i iiterate through the collection it gets the right value in vs but not in the using because i can put a key against a dictionary object could have also been used but now been setup this way and how my bll base classes and other numerous functions read it so not preferable to change refactored my code using a dicitonary and so that i have to rewrite the code that accesses the should work fine now as it handle collections int he same way as the collecitons object does my collection decide to start at 0 instead of

having a small problem with request caching using nsurlconnection asynchronous connections on the i know if i understood something or if cocoa is doing the opposite to what supposed to documentation for nsurlrequest says that the data for the url load should be loaded from the originating no existing cache data should be used to satisfy a url load that not only should the local cache data be but that proxies and other intermediates should be instructed to disregard their caches so far as the protocol if i send an nsurlrequest with nsurlrequestreloadignoringlocalcachedata is supposed to ignore local but use remote cache if the headers that are sent basic the status is 200 but if i use which is supposed to ignore both local and remote as the name one additional header is the response is 304 not checked the http and for it says any of the entity tags match the entity tag of the entity that would have been returned in the response to a similar get request the on that then the server must not perform the requested method if the request method was get or the server should respond with a 304 it seems that if i use instead of ignoring the remote cocoa tells the remote server explicitly that it use remote and if i use it add that line and in effect the remote cache is not what exactly is happening did i miss or is cocoa setting a wrong nsurlrequest and remote

how i approached this problem while maintaining a 10 year old legacy perl to give a slight bit of this was some of the worst of the i was initially depressed when i started working at the company because the code was so poorly thought out and laid out it was my first programming by the end of that gig i had a pretty good system of every new feature was added as a new module or nothing was hacked in on top of the existing this let me write unit tests for the new providing the confidence in so to integrate with the old stuff was just a matter of a line or any bugfix was implemented the same spend some time figuring out what was happening with the old stuff searching for the and write it out as a new method and wrap it in and then typically could however only works if got the and the to get it if you keep track of the time that you spend on any given especially where multiple bugs in the same or or at some point in easy to point at a given collection of code and say that this is so has cost n amount of time to was successful enough with this approach that i gained the honorary title also a fantastic skill to because more often than not the new job already has some code written	
how i would start sketching it have a course object which accepts a requirements object and a oncompleteactions object in its granted i would make the constructor internal and create a coursebuilder that will know how to build all of the different courses ever the course is updated it checks if the requirements are met by passing itself to the requirements if it meets the requirements it then passes itself to the void if object is nothing but an aggregate list of irequirement which you could fine tune based on the course that you the aremetby method simple enumerates all of your irequirements in the list and checks to see if your course satisfies them irequirement public bool you could have all sorts of different requirements that implement coursehoursrequirement public public bool return idea for the oncompleteactions would have a list of one or more ioncompleteaction that would execute each encapsulating each possible requirement in its own class you can then build a course that would have a a you could easily add new requirements as you go because they are all implementing the same you probably have to add some limit properties as you go but the real work is done inside of the

i believe that is what talking i believe the problem to be the iframe and not the combination of the draggable and i have this same issue and it also manifested itself with a prior implementation using the prototype implementation uses an iframe as a canvas on which to drop the way you can see the bug is to move your mouse too fast so that the cursor leaves the edge of the draggable the div stops moving and your mouse keeps by moving your mouse back to the surface of the it picks up the div again and starts moving even if released the click on your suspicion is that the iframe events somehow interfere with the jquery solution was to position a transparent div tag between the iframe and the this the iframe never sees the mouse movement and as such see code i revisited this issue and the iframefix seems to work great in all browsers for the but the resizables do not have the equivalent used this code to manually add a mask it as a mask over the iframe to prevent ie from stealing mouse mask when dragging the is a 1x1 pixel transparent fixes the issue for ie7 ie6 has trouble with and seem to figure out that the div should be between the iframe and the resizable i gave up on

i completely agree with the answer that pick the cleanest and optimize if it becomes a another way to look at it is that the fastest solution is the one that describes your intent most in this foreach says that like to apply some action for each element in the plain for loop say that like a counter you want to repeatedly add one to this value and as long as it is less than the number of elements in the you would like to perform some other the plain for loop overspecifies the it adds a lot of requirements that actually part of what trying to you about the loop but as soon as you write a for it has to be the other the qt people have made no additional promises that may affect they simply guarantee to iterate through the container and apply an action to other often the cleanest and most elegant solution is also the

i have a very odd using php part of though this also happens on a lamp server running as writing a web site using zend framework the software writing does a rather complicated statistical calculation that requires a lot of usually it runs fine with 128mb set as the memory the fun have a class which is exclusively responsible for getting the data it needs doing the calculations then returning the after it i have been unsetting as php seems to think that still in scope and holding up the memory for despite finishing the function in which it is called was causing problems where the second run of the calculation was hitting the memory limit and the script after this calculation is run once inside that it is run again in another function to do another calculation is during the same run of where things get i run that second the calling function runs despite the fact that there are absolutely no calls to that function from within the code which does this no errors or warnings appear in if i increase the memory limit to 1024 the overall calling function runs once and continues along its merry let me draw a map calls function calls function calls calculation function calls calculation function 128 mb of path of functions is as follows and back to the it runs a from the start of the for some to the end a conditional case which becomes true during this execution so the path 1gb of path of functions is as of which is what is supposed to i remove the second calculation from function it if i up the memory it have i found a bug in php memory or perhaps in the zend by increasing the memory limit per script in i see this or remove the second instance of running this calculation which uses a lot of very sure this is the way it despite the oddness of the way it does never seen this kind of jumping back to the start of a calling usually what would happen in this case is that php would error out and not restart the calling reaching memory limit causes function to

i have exactly one per test but i think more often i have several seen the case that eludes where a very large piece of code has a single unit test suite with just a few test and they are all labeled and each test case has hundreds of and even each condition usually depends upon the of previous whenever the build invariably in such a unit it takes quite some time to determine where the problem the other extreme is what your question a separate test case for each possible depending on what this might make but often i have several per test if you wrote you might have some cases that look void void void void try int number numberformatexception for string numstr but instead got the number expected simple rules that i can think of off hand for how many to put in a test have more than one that depends on the of previous together that test the same or facet need for the overhead of multiple unit test cases when not of the above rules should be overridden by practicality and common you probably want a thousand unit test cases with a single assert in each even several and you want a single test case with hundreds of

i like php but first and it is a templating not a general purpose programming language an fight embrace looked at a few different mvc frameworks like cakephp and zend and i have a hard time getting past the typically they are these 17 files you can make a is such a thing as complexity for sake of it and solving a problem before you have a problem and yet to be convinced that these heavyweight frameworks really adds more of a fan of the this is really your but i think that it leads to the cleanest end feel similarly about a lot of people on so are big fans of smarty but never made sense to me why add a templating language to templating i end up writing this kind of php script most of the set up db connections and so page site menu and so user submitted page validation rules if do db redirect user ie else output error display judicious use of helper functions pagination the above is incredibly easy to read and i also much prefer it to this hopefully you sanitize this but so many find this and even i have a hierarchy of php files that mirrors the site structure a menu point of where each page is a php if they have common behaviour they both require it which is typically used as a hack for poor seems a lot of programmers will throw a framework into the mix before there is really ever any i think this is a fairly lazy practice and one with a big every decision made today is one that becomes harder to change later so put off making decisions like this as long as introducing something later is easier than introducing something finding out it really do what you want and then changing it

i pointed out in to implement incremental search on a you should use structures like a or for searching patterns in large for discovering patterns in the middle of some text there is one simple i am not sure if it is the most efficent but i usually do it as i insert some new text into the i just insert then remove the first insert remove the second insert again and so on until the whole text is then you can discover every substring of every inserted text by just one search from the that resulting structure is called a and there are a lot of optimizations it is really incredible to find all texts that contain a given sequence of n characters you have to inspect at most n nodes and perform a search on the list of children for every depending on the implementation binary of the child node you might be able to identify the required child node with as few as 5 search steps assuming case insensitive latin letters interpolation sort might be helpful for large alphabets and nodes with many childs as those usually found near the

i read your question is is an ambiguous grammar or production rule consider the language you are what would be the implication of allowing an ambiguous production rule into the example describes a language which might include an expression b t b t b resolved as in your second example would be t b b t b t but in an ambiguous grammer it could also become t b t b t b or even t b t b t b t which could be valid might depend on the if the operator models it really be but if it was it might be this really depends on the second question to consider is what the resulting grammar source file ends up looking after the conflicts are as with other source a grammar is meant to be read by and secondarily also by prefer a notation that gives a clearer explanation of what the parser is trying to do from the that if the parser is executing some possibly undefined for order of evaluation of a arguments in an eager make the grammar

i see no benefit on selecting jca over other i see it as a drawback since you need java ee been skeptic about these java ee standards for some time i see a compelling reason to use a full featured java ee server since there are better open source implementations for feature been bitten several times by implementation incompatibilities when moving idea for jca is surfacing here right now and i am pushing to try or i am all for open source implementations that you can use and there is a lot going check list of maybe is smaller than whats already developed with but every bit is open sourced and all on one i believe the documentation is simpler and more the urge for integration calls for a powerful spi with plenty of open real live developed in the same and that can be found on the same am hating the but i like full featured application for i would go for tomcat and terracota over other just as i would go with camel before until the need for jca gets i like the idea of the java committee to tell how i should develop my own applications because i trust i believe it is in my best interest when the piece of software can work just as easily on java as in a java ee environments or in a pure servlet

i think i reproduced roughly what your describing and i deleted my original answer cause it was way i found is that when you want a content page to reference a user control being used in a master page and the control is accesible and what you will get an error indicating that you need to reference a specific and then you get errors indicating that no method exists of type such and adding the register page directive on the child page to the user control resolved this i reproduced this even with the control defined in the or on the in both cases i still had to explicitly add a register on the content make sense to me but it allowed my code to compile and give it a shot let me you do this you can reference the control assumes that you have a public property called messagebox on the master also found that this works much better if you register the control on both the master and the content page and not use the you want your child page to reference the user control your other option is expose methods on the master page like which would delegate to the user

i think we are all guilty of forgetting just who it is that we develop our applications it always easy as a developer to be able to take a step back and have a look at your application as a user might do this is why big companies employee hundreds of people to do this for them and they always get it is a massive subject but it is defiantly something that all developers need to keep in it has taken me a long time to learn this but when tackling any development task i always try to think about how my users are going to interact with what i am this will make a difference to all levels of your would suggest reading make me think by steve this book take you an age to read and it puts across some fantastic ideas that can help you to develop applications that are much easier to use and always find that once i have thought about the user experience the decisions about what my web pages are going to do and how they are going to interact are much easier to

i took a computer organization class they went through the low level details of how processors have come to how they process and how assembly is translated into machine maybe a little lower than what you are looking but i think getting a glimpse of how this type of translation occurs from a higher level language to a lower level language is really i think we used this book or one	
i totally misread the i was thinking you were talking about the load event on the document in the browser not the server side load my original answer is your html define a div which covers the area you want to in it put your please wait message and the very end of your page load set the div to this will hide the message showing the content behind you will probally want to absolutley position this div as it be a parent to the content your hiding hide the content when you set the display to

i try to replicate the without being able to replicate the error it is basically impossible in a program to guess the if break out the code in a separate standalone there are several reasons for if the original project is big it quite difficult to debug second it eliminates or highlights any assumptions about the normally always have another copy of vs open which i use for the debugging parts in mini projects and to test routines which i later add to the main having reproduced the error in the separate module the battle is almost it is not easy to break out a piece of code so in those cases i use different methods depending on how complex the issue in most cases assumptions about data seem to come and bite me so i try to add lots of asserts in the code in order make sure my assumptions are i also disabling code by using until the error eliminating dependencies to other modules sort of slowly circling in the bug like a vulture think i have really a conscious way of doing it varies quite a lot but the general principle is to eliminate the noise around the issue until it is quite obvious what it hope i sound too confusing	
i trying to drive a screw with possibly reading this you have a situation where actions within a controller have different access so you want to remove the duplication by creating a single check looking to do something like the parameter in parens thing is not and i still see a fair bit of duplication with an area of functionality as as controller if you do probably because looking at something the wrong that rails is proud to describe itself as would it be if you were able to know the action name in your filter is pretty could define permissions in a which seem to encapsulate the distinct elements of the if it got complex then the whole thing could move off into a although then probably duplicating functionality already available in a for in return if to that area requires additional something works on my current rails version although the rails book mentions an method that seems to return blank for

i understand the tracer bullet method has two main fundamental problems as soon as the client a useful result as soon as motivation in not each use case is probably to speed up the question is whether in doing so you endanger and whether the client is actually interested in even if certainly an advantage in beng able to get feedback from the client say your idea is ok as long as make sure that there any fundamental problems hiding in the parts this could definitely happen with error handling track anything you have to later in an issue tracker or by leaving todos in the source code and carefully go through those once the use cases are use cases are not so that the client give you useful feedback on	
i understand there are tasks that take a lot of is and as you just about every website has a registration process and the while i agree that implementing such features over and over again can be to some each application will have its own unique set of requirements meaning there will be at least a little customization work even if reusing code from an older i will now have a bash at answering your numbered zend use some of prototypes written to out a basic site i would not choose the zf for a nor would i use any mvc my current assumption is that a basic site consists of about 8 to 12 separate with no really special and finite remember that once we say there is almost always a noticeable performance in addition to whatever bugs and issues which might be inherent within that you speak of would be in the classes available within the zend for for creating a fully featured authentication system in about 15 or are there some site source to be built upon already though i have to my worst nightmare would be having to support an application built on some kind of framework that wraps another image how much fun debugging it would imagine how much fun teaching someone to support it would already using a not get greedy is there some app generator minor tool for pages with records not quite sure what you mean by but if i had to chance a perhaps zend

i used in several occations is to define the enum in the code and a storage representation in the persistence layer and then have conversion methods to map them to each these conversion methods need only be used when reading from or writing to the persistent store and the application can use the type safe enums in the conversion methods i used switch statements to do the this allows also to throw an exception if a new or unknown state is to be converted because either the app or the data is newer than the other and new or additional states had been

i want to reach the class owning the decorated method because at the point of no class owns the method def return value the same as return the decorator is built before the function is assigned to an owner when you write a function to a class or explicitly like it becomes an unbound method it has a reference to its owner which you can get by you can read inside which is executed after the but not in the decorator even then a bit ugly relying on a cpython implementation detail if you need not quite sure what trying to but things involving the owner are often doable using

implementation of ruby and jruby have quite different threading implementations so it may be impossible to have the answer for your but it appears that you might be trying to write fast concurrent code in my experiences with ruby is that this a reasonable ruby may be but still has a global interpreter lock like you are writing ruby code where you are considering these sort of potentially unsafe optimizations to wring out some extra you should probably consider using another idiomatic ruby tends to emphasize readability and expressiveness before efficiency and trying to wring speed increases and increased reliability out of the mri has been an exercise in frustration for been working on a ruby project for awhile that has just entered the phase where we are seriously looking at running the project in jruby and replacing the bottlenecks implemented in ruby with java libraries resulted in a pretty remarkable increase in speed and reliability with relatively little effort on our is not but its java integration has proven to be helpful and if it is impossible to use jruby for your or you are comfortable with c but not and sure you can write safe c without memory writing a c extensions to ruby or may be the best apologize if this question was completely academic in perhaps if you could let us know trying to

important difference here is that between value types and reference types represent directly a certain whereas reference types point to a memory location that should represent a when a a reference type actually does not point to a memory location with valid the reference is value types are direct representations of they cannot be it might be the case that a actual value of a value type is for this provides the nullable types when such a construct is not people tend to use special or default such as communicating with a lot of things we expect to be value types can actually be since that it the way the database handles unknown this can also be solved by the nullable but these were not always why dbnull to deal with a possible null in a

in a team and we are supposed to be setting up a wifi mesh network to run on google idea is to use the geolocation of each node to generate the ipv6 then use that to choose the closest node as the preferred node for routing some optimisation is made through periodic understanding main of doing a geolocation based algorithm is that each network hop will step physically closer to the and we that travelling in the most direct path to the is going to give us the most optimal routing my problem with this approach is that physical proximity load does not necessarily imply good connection strength or fast what if a thick lead or lots of proximity is a fairly useless metric for determining primary metrics should be primarily based on something signal demonstrated cpu time connected to at least that was my understanding of how routing paths should be is this a good is there something spent a lot of time working with so please put in noobmans wireless mesh routing

internationalizing a python with two goals in application loads classes from multiple each with its own i18n so modules in package a are using domain modules in package b are using domain locale can be changed while the application is module makes internationalizing a application very you just set the then call which finds the right and installs its method in the global namespace as but obviously a global value only works for a single and since it loads a single it only works for that could instead load the at the top of each and bind its ugettext method as then each module would be using the for its own but this still breaks when the locale is because is for the wrong i guess i could load the correct at the top of every but that seems awfully an alternative would be to still do it but instead of binding i would substitute my own which would check the current get its and forward the string to does anyone have a cleaner is the best way to internationalize a python app with multiple i18n	
internet applications is a good way to make robust software that act like traditional desktop one common problem with ria is that many developers tend to place business logic in the client side business logic and states in the code is very insecure as one can manipulate the code in run it is a whitebox which allows hackers to examine the code and find such as input validation done only in the client side code or manipulating be fooled by as it only slows down a but stop billy hoffman wrote a good book about ajax security and i recommend it for every ria mean that ria is by definition you can write secure ria if you know what you are doing business logic in client side no input validation done on server side there are a couple of frameworks which implement this securer server driven one is mill on and should also be one to my

is a c it takes a c source file and creates machine either in the form of unlinked object files or as an actual executable which has been linked to all object modules and is useful for controlling the build process of a a typical c program consists of several modules and header files it would be to always compile everything after you change so make is designed to only compile the parts that need to be after a does this by following rules created by the for cc rule tells make that the file depends on the files and and if either of them it can be built by running the command on the second above is not actual make wants the commands indented by a tab which i do in this editing imagine reads its rules from a file that is usually called a since these files are written by make has a lot of magic to let you shorten the for it knows that a can be built from a and it knows what the command to do so the above rule could be shortened to small program consisting of three modules might have a makefile like mycmd can do more than just compile a typical makefile will have a rule to clean out unwanted rm core rule might run diff makefile might run a tool to convert documentation from some markup language to html and for makefile might have an install rule to copy the binary program it builds to wherever the user or system administrator wants it so since make is generic and it is typically used to automate the whole process from unpacking a source tarball to the point where the software is ready to be used by the is a whole lot of to learn about make if you want to learn it the gnu version of make has particularly good has it in various

is an answer i posted to a question a while i modified it a bit to fit this has shown me that there are 3 major goals you have when learning a legacy learn what the code is supposed to learn how it does learn why it does them the way it three of those parts are very and a few tricks to help you get resist the temptation to just whatever your ide your way around the code to understand you probably be able to keep everything in perspective in your mind this especially when each line forces you to look at multiple other classes in order to understand what it so you need to be able to hold several levels of the stack in your documentation where it usually helps you quickly gain a mental framework upon which to build everything that test cases where be afraid to ask someone who knows if you have a you waste time with inane but if something that you simply understand is especially true with more conceptual questions it make much more sense to implement this as a or probably worth finding out the answer before you mess something up and know you do finally get down to reading the start at a logical place and go from just read the code top to or in alphabetical or anything is probably

is an even smarter and see what this code is doing and how we can improve code is serializing the one byte at a for each byte calling which is checking the free space in the internal vector if we have no room for another memory reallocation will happen the reallocation will not happen frequently typically happen by doubling the existing the new byte is copied and the internal size is increased by has a requirement by the standard which dictates that the internal buffer be also happen to have an and here is the best code you can come up is a test invalidlength you probably want to make this much to avoid resizing compressedbytes is as large as the length we want to p this is valid code and designed by the standard for such p points to a buffer that is at least as large as a copy all bytes in one above cast can be done in one go with the but it be this is more serializing this way even with the union is that on an processor the least significant byte will come while one a machine the most significant byte will come if you want to be you use a math method

is arguably more art than you have to remember is that like many things in programming and your website will be as slow as the slowest link in the meaning you will have some bottleneck such as the web disk your your etc that will limit the speed of your and growing your web site will involve identifying those issues as you grow and addressing at one point you may need to add more at another you may need another cpu and so at other times adding more memory might be useless because memory your lack of a certain resource can be like lack of memory can be masked by intensive disk as your system swaps constantly but disk the what do you first thing is you need to identify make a reasonable as to what a typical user will do and how much they will do ideally you will be able to model 100 or 1000 or however many users you need with software like jmeter to then get an idea of how your website how much bandwidth is going to be required and so by modelling 2000 users you will hopefully be able to see how linearly you web site may find that supporting 1000 users requires 1 gig of ram but 2000 requires 4 an example of scalability that expoes a problem you will have scaling your web site and the kind of thing to be revealed by performance hardware is so cheap these days that rarely a problem except for the biggest and most popular of sites can buy you 1 or even 2 servers with 16g of ram and cores shared and vps hosting are a different story because typically only want to pay for however much bandwidth and disk space you luckily those kinds of solutions tend to alow you to upgrade pretty easily least to a point where eventually have to go dedicating can make some dirty estimates at the beginning of a project by doing what they call of the run key queries say 100 times and work out hwo much cpu time they hit a mocked up page 100 times and work out how much bandwidth it generates and so these rough estimates combined with guesses about how users will use the site will give you a ballpark within a factor of of what

is at least as much a question about how method works in i think highlighted an interesting situation the first case the keyword on the the compiler decides to use the method overload with the parameter of type c because type is exactly equivalent to that of the parameter passed no implicit conversion is whereas an implicit conversion to the interface i would be required if the compiler were to choose the method that takes an argument of type i in other it chooses the more method the second case the keyword on the the compiler decides to use the overload of with parameter of type i because although you are overriding the method overload in the class it is effectively defined in the parent class making the method overload in fact the overload and therefore the most direct the first one the compiler this will help you to let me know if i need to clairfy any points if wrong about saying that the compiler does these then please correct though it makes little difference for the sake of the argument whether the compiler or it would

is happening because the plugin binds the event handlers on page and you are then adding dynamic content to the page after the the easiest solution would be to move whatever code you have to instatiate the domwindow plugin into a function and call it once on page load and again whenever a new link is if it starts double binding the already existing then have to give the dynamic links a different class and instatiate the second time around for that seems to be some misunderstanding so explain jquery feature you are using for was designed to fix the problem that you are you probably already know this and hence you are using the above paragraph was because i believe what you are saying is that the domwindow link you are returning is not opening the domwindow as you might this is because domwindow does not use internally to bind the so when you initially instatiate domwindow on page the links get but the new ones if willing to edit the source code of the plugin you could directly fix this by simply using but it is easier not as to just move the code to a function and call it whenever adding more content to the

is important to get as much information as possible about errors that are occurring back to the development log files are good in cases where there are no users to experice the error condition and you can be certain that someone is checking the log automatic email is great for server based alert messages are problematic because users never read one trick worked for me is to copy a detailed error trace on to the clipboard while a user friendly error is then train users to paste the error trace into an email error the web equivalent is to display a friendly message while sending a detailed error in an email to the development team from the should be a log of last in other what happens when writing to the log file causes an there should also be built in protection against type problems in which error handling itself locks the system on desktop sloppy error handling code can result in a never ending cascade of message boxes that leave no option but to kill the possibly losing data in the similar problems can result if error handling code triggers the error handling framework should detect error handling errors and stop reporting errors if there is no better vital batch nothing beats a proactive notification of if the email the user knows even if the error handling is should be caught at all event public component and service methods should catch all exceptions that in some an exception makes for when an exception is caught in a web service a soap exception should be but it is a bad idea to allow an excpetion to percolate across a component boundary it is usually a bad idea to catch exceptions on private methods of or in methods that are nested in the middle of a complex internal process of a it make sense to handle an exception in this context unless you can recover from the this internal code must be structured so that all resources will be released and database transactions rolled back in the presence of catch blocks in every method are the sign of using and finally blocks are a sign of a sound error handling that exceptions are exceptional you were expecting they be called rather than trying to anticipate when errors might concentrate on shoring up your component even trivial code that could not possibly experience an error should have a catch block if it sits on a that way when the code is modified later in unexpected ways the architecture will still component boundary may require a different reporting in the case of components that are design to run in different provide an error handling interface that client code can use to catch error forget the log of last resort if someone forgets to hook the error handling sum detailed error information the development team errors always at component only at component all code exception let the error handling part of the

is so much misinformation in the answers in this thread that i know where to i just spent 4 points in reputation voting down the answers with misleading and wrong information in jet database engine is all involved as the op clarified with an is by default it was built from the ground up to be that a jet data store is reliable when the network is not this means not a wan and not because the bandwidth has to be sufficient for jet to maintain the ldb file which means a ping by your local instance of the jet database engine once per second default and because jet recover from a dropped connection is quite common in a wireless situation where access falls down is when a access application mdb is shared is not the case for this the reason it fails is because sharing things that be reliably shared and have no reason to be because of the way access objects are stored in an mdb file entire access project is stored in a single blob field in one record in one of the system very prone to corruption if multiple users open in my sharing an access front end an unsplit mdb with the tables and all in one is the source for of corruptions of basic answer to the question is jet would be a great data store for an app of that if any possibility at all for the user population to grow above then it might be better to start off from scratch with a database engine that is more robust at higher user

is technically possible to reach up into the parent control and have your way with the controls it but it makes for code very difficult to maintain because if you change the structure of the parent you break code in all of the contained that would be considered a very design and often somehwat cleaner design would be to have your page classes raise an event when the save button is then your parent frame can sink the event and refresh whatever it knows needs to be refreshed after a save easier to maintain because your components are more loosely but it still puts a lot of database knowledge into your gui such a design might be appropriate for a relatively simple app on which you expect to do a lot of maintenance or future design pattern i prefer do many is to isolate the database handling and business logic inside one or more classes with a simple programmatic interface that can be tested the gui components are kept as simple and thin as so they can be easily changed if this is often called a pattern but there are other names for in your the class that encapsulates your business logic would have properties and methods for reading and setting and a or method that writes changes to a once the save is complete it would raise a or event that notifies all controls displaying information that the information has changed and they would refresh themselves based on the new values of the properties of your controller

is true for all negative there is one more negative number than there are positive numbers for twos complement is valid for one more case than n 0 solution that is the same same as got you by one it is not valid for one case more as i just recognized by comment will just overflow thought about using mod 2 but it does not work to if done it will work for all numbers except because this will played with it for a looking for a nice bit manipulation but i could not find a nice while the mod 2 solution fits in n this becomes the static int32 return 2 n n get it working for all you have to replace with and include the calculation in an then you get even mapped to itself as unchecked negation by another answer i am going to explain how the function works and how to construct such a start at the very the function is repeatedly applied to a given value yielding a sequence of n question demands that is two successive applications of negate the two further applications of four in total negate the argument again yielding n n there is a obvious cycle of length substituting and noting that the obtained equation yields the n x n we get a cycle of length four with two numbers and the two numbers if you imagine the cycle as a negated values are located at opposite of many solution to construct such a cycle is the following starting from n negate and subtract 1 add negate and add n 1 subtract concrete example is of such an cycle is we are almost noting that the constructed cycle contains an odd positive its even and both numbers we can easily partition the integers into many such cycles is a multiple of and have found a function that satisfies the we have a problem with the cycle must contain x because zero is negated to and because the cycle states already it follows x 0 this is only a cycle of length two and is turned into itself after two not into luckily there is one case that solves the if equals zero we obtain a cycle of length one containing only zero and we solved that problem concluding that zero is a fixed point of we have zero is a fixed point leaving and we must partition that number into cycles of four bad that is not a multiple of four there will remain three numbers not in any cycle of length will explain the remaining part of the solution using the smaller set of 3 bit signed itegers ranging from to we are done with we have one complete cycle now let us construct the cycle starting at problem that arises is that is not representable as 3 bit we would obtain by negating to what is still a valid 3 bit integer but then adding one to yields interpreted as unsigned integer it is but we have to interpret it as signed integer so actually for this example or in the general case is a second fixed point of integer arithmetic negation and are mapped to so the cycle is actually as is a cycle of length two and additionally enters the cycle via in consequence is correctly mapped to itself after two function is correctly mapped to after two function but is erroneously mapped to itself after two function we constructed a function that works for all integers but can we do we we have to construct cycles of length four and are able to cover the whole integer range up to four the remaining values are the two fixed points and that must be mapped to themselves and two arbitrary integers and that must be mapped to each other by two function map to and vice versa they must form a four cycle and they must be located at opposite corners of that in consequence and have to be at opposite this will correctly map and but swap the two fixed points and after two function applications and leave us with two failing so it is not possible to construct a function that works for all but we have one that works for all values except one and this is the best we can

is very similar to question and it has many of the details your are looking suffice to it is not the job of the os to track any of actually the runtime libraries or the underlying memory manager that will track the size of the this is usually done by allocating extra memory up front and storing the size of the array in that location use a head is viewable on some implementations by executing the following parray new size	
is very similar to the problem which relates moving a knight around a chess board without revisiting the same basically the same problem but with different key optimisation i remember from tackling the knights tour recursively is take your next moves in increasing order of the number of available moves on the destination this encourages the search to try and move densely in one area and filling it rather than zooming all over the board and leaving little island squares that can never be is make sure you have considered symmetry where you for at the simplest level the x and y of your starting square only need to go up to 5 since is the same as with the board

it has been mentioned tables are not inherently but bad form and reminiscent of the good old when it was the only way to accomplish some fancy capable browsers are almost statistical only reason to use and to going the css way is outlined in originally from when the availability of css capable browsers made css a viable the adoption of css was still held back by struggles with incorrect css implementation and patchy css even these problems continue to make the business of css design more complex and costly than it should and testing remains a other for continuing of css and lack of familiarity with css and required support from authoring risks posed by inconsistency between browsers and the increased costs of less frequently a requirement to deliver consistent appearance even to users of ancient if not of this points are already a thing of the strengths far out win perceived you are expecting a lot of friends to be browsing your site to see a table based layout i personally and i use quite a lot go with	
it has something to do with memory the first loop indexes the inner dimension of which happens to span over only 3 bytes each within one memory page easily believe a common size here is 4kb for one but with your second the outer index changes that will cause memory reads spread over a much larger range of memory namely which is and with each change of the inner those jumps start to happen that will hit different pages and is probably somewhat also i heard the cpu reads ahead that will make the first version because at the time it that data is probably already in the i can imagine the second version benefit from because it makes those large jumps around the memory back and would suspect the difference is not that but if the algorithm runs many it eventually becomes you probably want to read the article on that is the scheme used to store arrays in

it is but not terribly the complicating factor is that decorator actually passes through 2 levels of indirection dynamic function and one other to end up at which is a class with a say you have a decorated function that looks like def return return print results to see if the function has been wrapped can be as simple as checking the function you can do this inside the the name will actually be the name of the last wrapper for more complicated you can use the module to walk up the outer frames from the current frame if looking for something in the case of the fact that the decorator is actually an instance of the class means that the function is not really a and therefore has no trying the above code will raise an at the source code for shows that the instance will have a this is a pretty straightforward thing to test is also used to implement the other auth this approach will also work for never actually had a need to use so i really comment on what you should look for if you have multiple decorators around a single an exercise left to the i guess the frame unrequested editorial i would say checking the function itself to see if it was wrapped like this strikes me as a bit you can probably imagine all sorts of unpredictable behaviour waiting to happen when a new developer comes to the project as slaps on some other in also exposed to changes in the django framework a security risk waiting to would recommend van approach for that reason as something that is and therefore a much more robust

it seem to matter whether you use single quotes or double quotes when writing some programming languages treat them one more reliable than the other across multiple programming are there any pros or cons using one rather than the other from when apostrophes or quotes are in the would like to choose one and then be able to use it across multiple programming it meaning the same thing i use or for quoting strings if i want to be consistent across multiple	
it seems i need to emphasize that setters need to validate parameters and enforce so they are usually not as simple as they are did i really have to say with because fo the extra i tend to use them much more often now that visual assist gives me legwork is not more if you implement just the default setters getters inline in the class declaration i tend to do more complex setters move to the the getter should be it is no use to make the return value if you return by for potentially complex return values you might want to use const const const return many developers like to modify the setter as const return allows calling multiple setters as not universally accepted as a good visual provides this extension so that callers can use property syntax this increases legwork in the class a but makes caller code much friendlier in a little bit of more but a handful of decisions to make in typical

it turns out maven creates a jar that gets included in the lib folder inside the zip that snapshot jar contains the config files injected with the right in other words if you load your config files using the class loader instead of a file system reference it should any rate i was told not to put the config files at the root of the zip so the config files that maven was just pushing in the archive without injecting them even be there in the first place in my here is the new content of my file that gets included within the wrapper files still outputs a jar and a zip but since the zip contains the snapshot jar everything should be fine that might be for another post so let me know if i go off topic for this the values injected in the config files the one from the profile within my they are the ones from my that lives in my but turning off the activation in the profile seem to solve this here is the command line i clean is the profile in the containing the values to be

jalf suggests in the you probably want to use a variant of the recurring template that make a class template parametrised by the derived myhashingsolution typedef d void int void just for return this because you want the derived class to also be a you need to take the slightly unusual step of declaring as a class template that takes a template class state public void int requires int return key point is provided inherits from is a derived class of so the downcast in compiles and works you mess up and derive from instead and then try something that involves a call to the compiler will complain as the requirements for are not declare the concrete class you want to use like this solution has the side effect that you will need to change any other such to templates that ignore their one template in order to make them usable as template template

java but is relevant to most other technologies as not sure whether confused the use of a plain singleton with a both of them are design the service locator pattern is used by applications to ensure that there is a single class entrusted with the responsibility of obtaining and providing access to jms service locators are implemented as since there is no need for multiple service locators to do the same it is useful to cache information obtained from the first lookup that can be later used by other clients of the service the the argument about to ensure that there is only one active connection to your false and it is quite possible that the connection can be if left inactive for quite a long period of so caching a connection to the database is frowned there is one deviation from this the connection obtained from the connection pool is encouraged as long as you do so with the same within the same http or user request is this done from the point of view of since establishing new connections can prove to be an expensive

jet autonumber field is not an identity it is only a long integer field with a special default that default value can be increment or but as it is only a default you can append any long integer value to the field as long as it violate the incrementing autonumber will never revert to 1 except if deleted all records and or in the event of a corrupt seed the latter happened frequently in the early versions of jet 4 service pack where the seed value would get and this would lead to all sorts of including corrupted pk that eventually got and because jet is a windows hardly any computer out there is going to have anything less than jet 4 service pack onedaywhen you can get negative values if the incrementing autonumber exceeds the maximum positive value for long but this would indicate to me that you probably have enough records in your table that you need a different database or improperly treating your table as a temp table appending and deleting large numbers of others have also uniqueness is not controlled by the autonumber data but by the if you created a you could append duplicate i imagine why want an autonumber field with duplicate but the point is that you can do it if you add a unique since most autonumber fields are used as surrogate primary they will have the unique pk and the data table will be written in pk order in regard to if you are using an autonumber as a surrogate pk and you have any natural keys in the table that should be unique be no nulls you should also have a unique index on the natural key single field or a compound

know it is but in code reviews provide little value to begin there are few errors found almost never if you have competent most code reviews end with trivial action items and fix any unless you count grammar as a big more important review is did you test the what tests were did the developer do a sufficient level of that is where you will find out if the code works or is not that having peer reviews is a bad but the realities end up getting in the the main reality is that software is usually hard to understand and when it hard to understand then the problem it is solving is hard to while some companies have easier in the places i have worked it would frequently take a day or more just to understand the problem and requirements the code is solving before even being able to begin to dive into the code to understand if the code works if you understand the how can you find errors in the most people have the luxury of 1 days to properly review someone that there are some where code reviews are productive even at a rudimentary single most important reason for code reviews is that it forces any developer with pride in their work to make sure their code is of good enough quality that they would be willing to show it to other original developer in lead developer knows what they is having someone do the coding for code is either simple to grasp or a variation on a theme that is common at the in answer to your i would say

language spec the value p being boxed is a a char in the to or an int or number between and then r1 and r2 be the results of any boxing conversions of it is the case that r1 boxing a given value would always yield identical in may not be feasible using implementation the above are a pragmatic final clause above requires certain common values always be into indistinguishable implementation may cache or other this disallows any assumptions about identity of the boxed values on this would not sharing of some all of these ensures that in most the behavior will be desired without imposing an performance especially small less implementations for cache all characters and well as integers and longs in range of in some cases will in many others it will always use to be safe since you cannot grantee how the instances were speed is a factor start with an or at least they and you can gurantee how they were allocated and they fit in the above ranges then is vms may increase that but it is safer to assume the smallest size as specified by the langauge spec than to rely on a particular vm unless you really really really need	
languages are typically built around the concept of hence it makes more sense for language features to reflect including this behavior can be confusing at times but part of the problem and advantage to having state in your think the best proof of this argument is to look at some of the more recently languages which have closure both and imperative oo chose to have mutable while a functional has immutable closures deriving from the idea that is immutable by what would it actually mean to have an immutable closure in an imperative most people think of this as making the variables equivalent to sure value types would be protected from but what about mutable reference you be able to change where the variable pointed but you could call a mutating function and get a similar for student public string name var student new name del could be implemented with an immutable closure as i actually modify where the variables point however i am clearly still doing a mutating	
languages are very closly related to the hardware architecture of the target a large extent there is a one to one mapping from asm code to machine instruction thats the whole point really so you can manipulate the hardware at the level of individual also allow you to access and manipulate memory in a manner that matches the machines memory architecture virtual vary greatly some do litle more than translate three letter codes to 4 byte like the venerable assembly language are sophisticated programming nevironments in thier own said all this most modern chips are emulating ancient instruction sets so you are really not that close to the wire the better c compilers are aware of the underlying like how many integer instructions ar e executed every cycle so a good c compiler will nearly always out perform mediocre assembly

like to be able to source control my excel vba modules using excel 2003 so that i can share and manage the code used by a bunch of different spreadsheets and therefore like to them from files when the spreadsheet is got a module called that i use to do most of the donkey work and unloading any other modules that are and like to be able to load it up from a file as soon as the spreadsheet is attached the following code to the event the thisworkbook sub call call removeloader within the thisworkbook contains the following sub dim y as dim nummodules as dim compname as with nummodules y while y if 1 compname if 0 oldmodules nummodules if oldmodules nummodules 1 y msgbox to remove compname module from vba end end end y y end is probably a bit overcomplicated and slightly crude but trying everything i can find to get it to load the external when i open the the removeloader function finds that a module already included in the vba project that it is unable to and it also fails to load the new loader module from the ideas if what trying to do is excel seems very fond of appending a 1 to these module names either when loading or removing not sure control of excel vba code

like to follow up with jon advice with a couple more you are writing a and are likely to have a high amount of insert use sql lock manager is if you do use sql use serializable transactions happens to be the default for the transactionscope things will fall apart on you sql compact support temporary and when you try to simulate them inside of serialized transactions it does rediculsouly stupid things like take on the index pages of the also it really eager about lock even if you use temp if you need serial access to multiple tables your best bet is to use repeatable read give atomicity and and then implement you own hierarchal lock manager based on rather than using the based you do you need to be careful john skeet to create a well defined lock you do create your own lock use fields to store information about the locks you and then add asserts every where inside the lock manager that enforce your lock hierarchy this will help to root out potential issues up any code that runs in a ui add asserts on or you should similarly add the inverse assert to code that runs in background that people looking at a method will just by looking at what threading requirements the asserts will also help to catch like even in retail means but you can make your throws look like a crash dump with an exception that says violated threading rules by doing along with stack is much easier to debug then a report from a customer on the other side of the world that says now and then the app just freezes on or it spits out gobbly

linq and columns	
linq on a pipes and filters is a api meaning that data is lazily returns as you ask for it iterator rather than loading everything at and returning a big buffer of means that your qry from row in source where select new qry new you enumerate over it will consume the data you can see this graphically with jon the only things that break the pipe are things that force for high volume jon and myself worked on for doing aggregates without buffering in such by most orm tools entity is a slightly different because the database engine is going to do most of the heavy the chances are that most of the steps are already done all that is left is to consume an and project this to but that is still typically a pipe implements unless you call regard to use in is that it is fine to use to write composable queries inside the but they the repository as that would make the internal operation of the repository subject to the so you would be unable to properly unit test profile optimize taken to doing clever things in the but return this also means my repository stays unaware of the is a shame as the temptation to from a repository method is quite for this would allow the caller to add but remember that they actually consumed the data this makes resource management a in mvc etc need to ensure that the calls or so that it the view that is controlling data access you unit test the controller use of filters in the dal would be things string ctx new qry qry qry return added filters but nothing happens until we call at this the data is obtained and returned the in the this can be fully unit if we did something similar but just returned the caller might do something var custs all of a sudden our dal starts failing translate to you can still do a of interesting things in the only pain point here is that it might push you to have a few overloads to support different calling patterns until i find the best answer here is to use extension methods on the that i only need one concrete repository customerrepository public string string icustomerrepository string string class customerrepositoryextensions public static this icustomerrepository string string return we have virtual overloads extension on so our caller can use without having to specify the without using pipes and filters becomes a lot more be writing some kind of text based query you can obviously append but it very the is a bit better but not as elegant as

looks like a solid way to do only suggestion is that if really concerned about performance with you may want to add generic versions for several common cases probably that for those objects are most likely to be composite you have the overhead of building the array to pass to the the any boxing of generic the call syntax will be exactly the but run slightly more optimized code for that of run some perf tests over this before you decide whether worth the maintenance like static int object t1 t2 t3 t4 int hashcode hashcode hashcode hashcode hashcode return

looks like the method is indended to handle a value that comes from a html if no value is specified for the it uses the value by if the checkbox is not checked there is no value at all from it in the form so reading the key from gives a null this context the method is althought quite horrible due to the use of the also it should have been given a name that is more fitting for specific like rewrite of the method is correct and as the value is not culture converting the value to uppercase should not use the current so a rewrite that is even slightly better than the one that you proposed would value null culture independent methods are also a bit faster than the ones using a specific so there is no reason not to use the evaluated from the it was method calls so that all expressions were actually they as the inner call has to be made to evaluate the parameters for the outer the second and third operands of the conditional expression is only evaluated if they are so the expressions are evaluated from the outside and the outermost condition is evaluated first to decide which of the operands it will

love to hear from the programmers about why mvc with java said to fall there is absolutely nothing wrong with implementing mvc in just about any a not a language never heard anyone say in java falls before my guess is that either the quote was taken out of context or the person who made the statement has little experience with java or intended something to use the classes in cocoa just to write a cocoa nice that and that all kinds of great support in the tools interface to use and there are probably very few cases where you use but nothing fundamental to the language that makes an mvc implementation than an mvc implementation that was coded in just as the cocoa frameworks provide all kinds of great support for mvc with the various controller and view there are scores of good frameworks for java which provide support for implementing	
low level can be explored with a disassembler but the short answer is that a bunch of where the predicate depends on the instance of check followed by fetching the two arguments and assigning to two variables l and r but see below about custom extractors equality foo instance of x assignment to a fresh do this is the tail else on the much more that you can do with patterns like or patterns and combinations like but generally those are just logical extensions of what i just patterns can also have which are additional constraints on the there are also cases where the compiler can optimize pattern when some overlap between cases it might coalesce things a advanced patterns and optimization are an active area of work in the so be surprised if the byte code improves substantially over these basic rules in current and future versions of addition to all you can write your own custom extractors in addition to or instead of the default ones scala uses for case if you then the cost of the pattern match is the cost of whatever the extractor a good overview is found in	
lower level why are you doing approach is widely used in java but hardly ever used in and is not a preferred approach you simply do not need it as libraries will not throw exceptions the way java library calls and if you are writing your own libraries you should not expect callers will naturally think to look for exceptions to convention most widely used and understood is that of a delegate that has an error method or perhaps notifications for more general failures that you need to pass up through multiple levels of that approach might be more widely used in the java world if there were a simple notification system the way cocoa has it set delegate approach has the same documenting property as declaring an exception in java they are just different approaches but generally better to use an approach more suited to the language at hand unless a very compelling reason to do	
m n work because it starts with and goes through all the and then has and goes through all the but just the part is so you will never get to m 1 or 2 or so m n is exactly the same as n generate all of you either need to like users vartec and hynek that the set of numbers you want is just the natural numbers or you need to somehow enumerate all the pairs such that are one way to do that is to go along each of the where is the so we start with the numbers where n and then the ones where n each of these diagonals has a finite number of so you will always go on to the next and all the pairs will eventually be we let m and then m n becomes i i j for you can just i j course this method will also produce duplicates for you because there are multiple pairs that generate the same number in your	
macfarland did a good job but i can add a following the tools in your box for decoupling are data attached behaviors and data binding should be self already gotten a good description of but suggest you avoid routedcommand and stick with an icommand attached behaviors are attached that subscribe to events on the element they are attached and in this scenario would be used to relay event handling to the interfaces give you the greatest but you have to work out how to pass the interface to the the best way to learn all of this right now is to google and to look at existing a list of wpf this one comes from the microsoft patterns practices lots of good stuff but one of the examples of the three things above that you can learn from here is how to use prism includes a delegatecommand that implements icommand and simplifies using commands from a viewmodel in recently one of the key things you can learn from this one is how to use attached which this library uses for the author of this this one been released though the current alpha source is this one provides a novel solution to the problem of how to provide interfaces to your

made several attempts at writing this exact piece of i can say you be able to do this with absolute and you certainly be able to detect all of the uri forms allowed by the since you have a very limited set of urls interested you can use any of the techniques the other thing i can say with a great deal of is that if you really want to beat the best way to do that is to use send a chunk of javascript that performs some and repeat the calculation on the server the javascript should copy the result of the calculation to a hidden field so that when the comment is the result of the calculation is submitted as verify on the server side that the calculation is the only way around this technique is for spammers to manually enter comments or for them to start running a javascript engine just for i used this technique to reduce the spam on my site from to one or two per now the only spam i ever get is entered by humans weird to get	
made some changes and commited them version and found out that they introduced new bugs to my program some minutes so i switched to some of the files to an older version to get some of the files back to version 1 on my local since then i have made a lot of changes i want to and i have used commit to get my local changes on the version i have locally is exactly what i want to be on the repository as head even though some of the files are still officially on i assume i should be using svn merge in some but not really sure how to do any when i use it shows changes from the local version to the rep i could do but then i would have a version locally so what i want is some kind of forced that just says is the newest when doing svn reports that there are no thanks to neil butterworth for the what i finally i should just have used but i was dumb enough to do an update without really thinking about what i was of everything was then really messed up beyond so what i finally did was to export the project to a new obviously not the way you should do but i did not want to mess with this stuff any in the end i had to get back to making actual progress on the actual i know that i do stuff like that when working in a bigger but to force your local version as newest on	
made some edits to your post so that it makes more sense and added a link to what i think is the article you are it looks like you are probably adding the suggested line of code in at the wrong place in the although the referenced article all that specific about where it is supposed to also it does not provide further information about the context of the change or what the whole project is supposed to so i was stuck trying to provide you with further i would make sure that you do not directly copy and paste the code from the pdf file as it seems to have put in extra spaces between the a line of code in is required to end with a you have not specified whether or not you had done that properly

make your life a lot easier having a table of live data separate from your audit a very good for normal operation you need to even look at the audit data so having it the same table as your live data is just going to cause easiest way to manage this would be to put a trigger on the live table so that whenever a record is it automagically inserts a new record into the audit expanding on thoughts on i would imagine that regardless of the serial all pieces sharing the same sku would have the same if this is the having a separate price table is definitely a good idea

makes sense to use a pointer to a pointer whenever the pointer actually points towards a pointer chain is hence etc are reason for creating such code is because you want the to be able to properly check the types you are using mystery dont have to use such types you can always simply use a simple and typecast whenever you need to actually dereference the pointer and access the data that the pointer is directing but that is usually bad practice and prone to errors certainly there are cases where using void is actually good and making code much more think of it more like your last its mostly for helping the compiler to make sure things are used the way they are supposed to be

maurice herlithy shows in the art of multiprocessor programming that actually can be written without locks chapter this essentially involves splitting tasks into processing node elements a function and enqueuing each threads will calculate the state by following all nodes from the latest cached obviously this in worst result in sequential but it does have important lockless preventing scenarios where threads could get scheduled out for long peroids of time when they are holding herlithy also achieves theoretical meaning that one thread will not end up waiting forever to win the atomic enqueue is a lot of complicated queue stack is surprisingly hard the other things may be very become accustomed to atomiccas until i swapped it they are incredibly an intuition for correct with cas can help though you should use good testing and maybe more powerful tools upcoming mit or to check correctness if you can reduce it to a simple post more about your difficult to give a good answer without immutibility is nice but applicability is if understanding it it really overcome consider two threads executing they could both read then both write not the correct for a classic increment probably slow due to heap allocation has to be synchronized across

may be a simpler way of doing this and i am all ears if there my situation is i have a dropdownlist on a form which i successfully populate with text and i also need to have additional related string values from the same table row in the db table available on the client so when the user selects from the dropdown this related data gets populated in a textbox on the there are only 4 records dealing with so storing on the client is no big i thought about passing this data via viewdata as a list and loading into a javascript when the user selects from the dropdown i would determine the selected index and get the related data i need from the i am already using the value of the dropdown item for other required data so i need a way to get this related data without making a return trip to the if i am on the right track could someone post a simple example of populating a js array with sting values returned as a list in the simple example of how to populate javascript array from viewdata

me coder for i have i put some code into a dll in the and now i am confused about how the gac is really working with our intranet environment i have several related web applications each application runs from a separate and potentially runs in its own app for now all of the apps are on the same but that is not this setup allows us to develop and migrate each app there are several parts of each app that we wanted to be common across all of our applications logon menus the request from management was that changes to these files could be and would take effect without having to and each web there are lots of ways to accomplish this and despite warnings to avoid the this really seemed like a case where using a virtual path provider and a dll stored in the gac made put together a virtual path and then embedded the files and resources i needed to be common into a could have had the vpp pull the files from a but i was hoping that embedding the files into the dll itself would be more want the developers of each app to have to mess with their own gac to test and run their so in each solution i just included the virtual path provider and made its result copy well as strongly this means that the provider along with its embedded files are copied to the bin directory of the as long as the developer have a version of this dll in their gac they the local bin copy is this allows the developer to easily change and test both the files and the files that are common to every also means that unless it is deliberately the common dll will exist in the bin directory of every app in production as since iis will always use the gac version if it even if the local version is out of the gac version is always accepted this as reasonable for now since i find an easy way to both have the copy local for and yet not copy to the bin when the app was copied to the coding an app so that it always uses the latest version of the dll instead of the specific version that it was compiled with seems like a fairly complicated i have yet to see a good example of how to do but i think i would need a chain of publisher it seemed much easier to try the more obvious answer leave the version number of the dll unchanged when migrating a new version of the vpp dll to the this seemed to work until it the windows on the i replaced an older version of of my dll in the gac with an updated copy of even though i had updated the dll in the my apps continued to use the old version of the restarting and even rebooting the server entirely did not seem to what really flipped me out was that eventually iis would mysteriously and unexpectedly correct itself and start using the correct copy of the dll from the have seen many gac related questions of this type that all seemed to end with of the sudden my website started working correctly it took a while for me to see that this was an effect of how iis was caching my strongly named and that i was the way strongly named were supposed to i tried removing the version of the dll from the gac because there was still a copy of my dll in the bin i expected that the process would either or to the version that was in the bin however because the version in the bin was also iis continued to use the cached copy of the which now no longer existed on the had me really baffled for a because i lost confidence that the gac version was ever running at the only way i had to assuredly get the dll to update was to remove the copy of the dll from the remove the copy of the dll from the bin run the site so that it would and then put the new version of the dll into the starting and stopping iis during this had no this consistently got my applications to use the new code much for simply sticking a new version of a dll into the gac and having its new effects propagate reading some related what i am trying now thesoftware of the dll in the gac still leaving the version number new dll at everything in the folder i think a but of a appears to be but it still seems like there is something wrong with having to go to all this is there an easier way to force iis to use the current instance of the is there a better way to accomplish the effect that i am common files and files shared among various that can be updated separately from the apps based on a comment from shahkalpesh i found this page at microsoft included this tiny tidbit of assembly redirect one version to use the the oldversion attribute can specify either a single or a of for specifies that the runtime should use version instead of the assembly versions between and means that along with my i could push a single publisher policy file that redirected everything to the that sort of mitigates what i thought would be a nightmare chain of where i had to maintain a link from every possible version to the will try this and see if updating the version like this also triggers iis to use the correct version of the new file resetting the app a dll in the gac that contains aspx pages for a web

me take a crack at first written some on this subject in an orm or plain specifically to address your of is about if you know sql the learning curve for ibatis is ibatis does some things on top of sql such still need to learn but the biggest hurdle is includes on the other hand tries to distance itself from sql and present things in an object rather than a relational as joel points out are and jpa is no to do jpa still need to know about relational performance tuning of queries and so ibatis will simply having you apply the sql you know or are jpa will require you to know something how to configure it xml or by this i mean figuring out that foreign key relationships are a relationship or of some the type you know sql i would say the barrier to learning jpa is actually if you more of a mixed result with jpa allowing you to effectively defer learning sql for a time it put it off jpa once you setup your entities and their relationships then other developers can simply use them and need to learn everything about configuring this could be an advantage but a developer will still need to know about entity transaction managed vs unmanaged objects and so worth noting that jpa also has its own query language which you will need to learn whether or not you know you will find situations where just do things that sql is a hard one to personally i think more productive in ibatis but also really comfortable with some will argue way more productive with hibernate but this is possibly least in unfamiliarity with the productivity with jpa is deceptive because you will occasionally come across a problem with your data model or queries that takes you a half a day to a day to solve as you turn up logging and watch what sql your jpa provider is producing and then working out the combination of settings and calls to get it to produce something both correct and just have this kind of problem with ibatis because written the sql you test it by running the sql inside sql server management navicat for mysql or after the query is all doing is mapping inputs and i found to be more awkward than pure you need separate tools to just run a query to see the results and something more you have to i actually found this whole part of jpa rather awkward and unwieldy although some people love danger with ibatis here is proliferation meaning your dev team may just keep adding value objects and queries as they need them rather than looking for reuse whereas jpa has one entitty per table and once you have that named queries tend to go on that entity so are hard to queries can still be repeated but i think less of a potential comes at the cost of rigidity often in an application you will need bits and pieces of data from different with sql easy because you can write a single query a small number of to get all that data in one hit and put it in a custom value object just for that jpa you are moving up that logic into your business entities are basically all or now not strictly various jpa providers will allow you to partially load entities and so forth but even there talking about the same discrete if you need data from 4 tables you either need 4 entities or you need to combine the data you want into some kind of custom value object in the business or presentation other thing i like about ibatis is that all your sql is external xml some will cite this is as a disadvantage but not you can then find uses of a table column relatively easy by searching your xml with sql embedded in code where there is no sql at it can be a lot harder to you can also cut and paste sql into a database tool and run i overstate enough how many times this has been useful to me over the i think ibatis wins hands straight sql and low by its nature jpa simply be able to manage the same level of latency or now what jpa has going for it is that latency and throughput are only rarely high performance systems however do exist and will tend to disfavour more heavyweight solutions like with ibatis you can write a query that returns exactly the data you want with the exact columns that you fundamentally no way jpa can beat even that when returning discrete of think this one is a win for ibatis like i mentioned with jpa you will sometimes spend half a day getting a query or entity produce the sql you want or diagnosing a problem where a transaction fails because the entity manager tried to persist an unmanaged object could be part of a batch job where committed a lot of work so it might be nontrivial to of them will fail if you try to use a table or column that which is you mention portability as one of your requirements moving between database worth noting that here jpa has the the annotations are less portable hibernate xml standard jpa annotations have an equivalent for id but both of them are more portable than ibatis seen jpa hibernate used as a form of portable meaning you run a small java program that creates the database schema from jpa with ibatis need a script for each supported downside of portability is that jpa in some lowest common meaning the supported behaviour is largely the common supported behaviour across a wide range of database if you want to use oracle analytics in no in a

modern ides a lot of graphics and disk io going neither of which is performed well by so if your vm responds fast enough for the developers to then say no reason why if it you either need to get a faster machines for them or go back to documenting how to setup the build other factor against vms is that if you change the you have to do it for all and document the changes if telling everyone how to set up their you might as well let them set their own system up on the base we do have vmsa for this but they tend to be for old versions of the so we can still build it without having to install the old service sdks and its but i find installing everything locally and switching between them junction to point to the build is iirc vmware has a virtualisation project called that transparently puts a os environment onto your local so you can have several conflicting applications running not used but did look into it as something that might be better than whole guest vms running in their own

mostly i would only change one thing in the connect method as i explain in connections are not everything is done with no connection state is stored unless you implement this in third objects as you do with your the objects in python bindings are mostly proxies that abstract the remote objects as if you were to but what it really does is to build messages based on the information you give to object instantiation interface and so the service cannot know when the client is done if client announce it with other explicit handle unexpected client finalization you can create a object in the client and send the object path to the service when change your method to accept also an the service can listen to signal to know if a client has create the individual object you only have to instantiate an object in the same service as you do with your but you have to be sure that you are using an unexisting you could have a and various if you need to store the connection you have to do something like

my opinion there some things you should think the customer need a function to customize his there a lot of different attributes or the effort of creating such an worth i think that its pretty obvious why you should think about it really depends on your project if that kind of model makes you want to create some a lot of forms that can be customized at runtime then this model could be pretty if you need to do a lot of smaller tools and you use this as some kind of then this effort could be worth it because you can save a lot of that kind of you could automatically add error check the values or add other things that are always build up with the same but if you have too many of this elements or attributes then the performance can go down things that becomes interesting in bigger projects that changes that have to occur in each form just have to be made in the not in each this could save a lot of time if there is a bug in the finished our company we use a similar model for an interface generator between now i cant remember the right word for and our just that it doesnt create an but an output file for one of the use xml to define the structure and how the values need to be converted and so

my personal game i use a entity can read more about it by searching based game a famous article is your from the cowboy programming my entities are just ids unsigned a bit like in a relational the data and the logic associated to my entities are written into i have systems that link entity ids with their respective something like unsigned long component entityid class system c for each kind of i write a special all entities have the same example you could have a static rock object that has the worldpositioncomponent and the and a moving enemy that has the same components plus the an worldpositioncomponent public component float rendercomponent public component worldpositioncomponent 3dmodel void game void entityid visibleobject watch out for memory new new entityid invisibleobject new no rendercomponent for void rendercomponent for it you have 2 worldposition and the game class holds the 2 the render component has an access to the position of the if the entity have a worldposition you can choose default or ignore the method will only render there is no waste of processing for can also split my game class into two or to separate display and input systems from the something like view and find it neat to define my game logic in term of and to have entities that only have the functionality that they need no more empty or useless collision detection	
my point of view you are in the wrong way to do what you will read token stopping each time it reads the finding the token it will discard it as it begins with next iteration in its loop it will handle token one on the then the next it reads the next one which is please note the end of line character in the middle of the the i am not sure it is what you the behavior you want is your program to skip commented lines with a better read a whole line instead with in a first do not specify any character as the third parameter when calling must be taken as the delimiter to get the this first add a first check to see whether a character begins the if so call the continue otherwise enter in a second nested loop to interpret all tokens in your this time using method to find the loop until you read the whole could either considering boost tokeniser while never used it a very long time ago when i was i remember it was quite appropriated to do that kind of job in a very simple believe there are also good libs to read a file and discard commented maybe in boost a shame i really have to get a deeper look in this lib

my problem is as building a simple calendar module for my intranet we use google for your calendar and like to give the employees the ability to see all the feeds subscribed to in one like on the real google reason not just using the the gadget they provide is because like a single week their gadget currently only offers full month and like a that basically just looks like one row from the full made such an now we just need to populate can get it to work with one i can even get it to work with all the feeds a user has subscribed the problems is that from what i can tell the only way i can get all the events from every feed that a person is subscribed to is to loop through their list of feeds and make a new call to google asking for the events each if a person is subscribed 12 going take a long idea that could help with the speed problem is to store the results in our database and update it occasionally for each of our of that will probably slow our servers down because it basically will be constantly querying google due to the number of feeds and time it takes to retrieve each there a way to ask for all the events from a list of feeds instead of querying individually for each any help would be greatly the using php and the zend gdata standalone in multiple event feeds with one gdata calendar

my project we created stub files for testing junits in we have to externalize these after seeing a number of we settled on using xstream to serialize and deserialize these stub works like a its pretty good at what it claims to we had a single factory class say afactory which produced all the stubs needed for testing different test now when externalizing each of the stub we hit a road we had to create 1 xml file for each stub produced by the final class public static a here public static a here public static a here when trying to move this stubs to external we had to create 1 xml file for each stub and the problem with this approach is it leads to proliferation of xml stub was how about keeping all the stubs related to a single bean class in a single xml here comes the externalized xml stub representation there a framework which allows you keep all the stub in xml representation in a single xml file as above or what do you guys suggest should be the right approach to adhere to junit stub

my this approach is really only beneficial if one of two things is whatever extenuating your argument signature is i kinda go by 6 as a maximum not for any specific reason though just seems right but i freely admit that this number is or many of your arguments are and sometimes you only need to set a value for the 5th one or some such annoying to write 1 either of these is true for faking named params with an associative array might be the right aside from knowing when to avoid extract avoiding it i immediately think of other being oftentimes both of these problems can be solved through refactoring as

my which is javascript and jquery but also uses master pages and ajax i am consistently seeing on the status bar of ie 6 occasionally ie the message items or items followed by this message never goes away and may or may not prevent some page functionality from running certainly seems to bog but not can cause this to happen of the time by just refreshing an but the number of items the file it mentions usually it is or googled for answers and there are several suggestions or some of them worked for and others practical for us to implement or are some of the caching images so it repeatedly asks for the same image if the image is repeated on the page and the server assumes that it should be cached locally since already served it in that page ie displays the images but sits and waits for a server response that never typically the file it says it is waiting on is repeated on the page is using png graphics with indeed it but they are themeroller generated graphics according to the are ie the components are the only things using all of our png references are in if that changed some of the graphics from png to but it is just as likely to say waiting for as it is for are being specified in css javascript but are on things that currently being displayed none items for this be but if it then i would think preloading images would but so adding a preloader do any caching policy is confusing the if this is it is only microsoft server sw having problems with browser surprise me at i have much control over the iis configuration that will be hosting the anyone seen this and found a way to combat particularly on apps with jquery and other data on at least one of the just commenting out the datepicker component setup causes the problem to go but i think at least not if that fixes all of the if it does have to swap out because that functionality needs to be there seem to be any open issues against on checked the iis settings and content was set on any of my unchecking that setting was a common suggestion for fixing this have page that i can consistently create the error using the file also tried with the same the problem only occurs when i refresh the page that contains the if i comment out the datepicker the problem goes here are a few things i notice when i do page always says item downloading picture but only when i look at http i see that it requests that image from the server every time it is dynamically turned without regard to of the requests for that graphic are complete and return the graphic none are marked code 200 or 304 that the server is telling ie to use the cached why it says waiting on that graphic when all of the requests have completed i have no is a single other graphic on the page of the ui png that has a code 304 on another page where i managed to log http traffic with items two different graphic files ui had a 304 as well neither was the one listed as error is not innocuous the page is not fully for if i click on one of the buttons which should execute a the page away from the page and coming back does not produce the have moved the script and script references to the bottom of the content and this affect this the script is still running in the though too hairy to divide out unless i absolutely have update and were a lot of good answers and suggestions but none of them were exactly our the closest one the one that led me to the was the one about long running so i awarded the bounty there guess i could have answered it but rather reward info that leads to was our we had multiple jqueryui datepickers that were created on the event in script included from the master on this client a local event had script that destroyed the datepickers under certain we had to use because the previous version of datepicker had a problem with when we upgraded to the latest version of jquery ui and replaced the with for the the problem went away mostly went away if you do things too fast while the page is it is still possible to get the items theory as to what was happening goes like page content loads and has 12 text boxes with the master page script on those text queues up requests for graphic ie know how cache dynamic the requests get client area script datepickers so the no longer is left with some number requests that it what to do have ideas for solving the items problem on internet

not afraid of using you can make your function a template and use sfinae to check for the two typename will create a method for every type that extends both feature interfaces that the sfinae trick is not needed for it to an unconstrained template would but just fail to compile when you pass a type that meet the possibility is to create an interface ifeaturexy extending and use this in the function this has the drawback that types that implement both but not this joint interface would not be usable with this you can pass two arguments to the one per and require they are pointers to the same this is but could be hardened by making some template class to hold the two pointers which would be initialized by the single object in question and which would hold the two you could probably do the same thing with bounded type variables they allow multiple not sure

not aware of any hard limit outside the physical limitations of available memory or perhaps i be too surprised if there more important is that a datagrid is a construct shown to users much appreciate a grid with 1000 items let alone i have seen point is that rather than worrying about the maximum records you can stuff in better off implementing paging or a better search	
not aware of any method for doing what you are the specific purpose of ibatis is to automate the mapping of relational models to not sure what trying to but if you have meaningful you should be able to map to an object of some even if the object will be guessing that you need some logic based on the values fetched by your if the create a new map the query to it and then move the logic into your new pojo instead of wherever it is this will make the code much cleaner and easier just trying to pull back raw data without mapping to a you probably need to give your design a second know not the answer looking for

not information which a server gives out to clients by the only way to know is keep opening connections until it fails or ask the server owner to offer a service you can poll which returns this after thinking some more about this not sure if possible to determine this via with any real degree of if the server returned server when it reached its connection limit i assumed would happen when i made my original it would be easier to but generally when servers go over their connection they simply respond until a new connection is the client simply waits for a there is no hard way to distinguish between a server which took 10 seconds to respond because its connection limit had been and a server which took 10 seconds to respond for any other even if you still attempted to test it in this the requests you make to the server would need to stay open long enough to ensure that the connection you create all subsequent are still open when the nth request times that would mean either calling a service which takes an arbitrarily long time to return a process or a or download an inconveniently large either approach is extremely inefficient at

not sure exactly what you are asking as the terminology you are using is a little unclear but here if you have a superclass and a subclass you can hide the methods in the superclass from the subclass by making them if you need public methods on the superclass to be invisible you are out of if you cast the subclass to the superclass then the public methods on the subclass are no longer suggestion that might help you would be to use composition rather than extract the sensitive methods into a separate class and then insert an appropriate instance of that class into the object as you can delegate methods from the class to the injected class if you need

not sure the question is windows go out to the mapped network share to read the necessary code page in from disk or will it make a copy of it locally when first code must be in local memory to be a page fault on a network mapped drive will cause network to fetch the appropriate which will be loaded into local memory and then this since the image exists on a remote share assuming the page fault handler must go out to the network share to retrieve the code is this the page fault handler know the drive is network it will issue a file system the network mapping driver will intercept that and convert it into a network so the page fault handler is just doing its normal it know doing voodoo in the have an application running in this manner and periodically it seems to the system but the system becomes responsive after a short period of sometimes just a few seconds and in other cases this system also has a lot of and dlp products installed on it and thus several tdi filter drivers and file system filter drivers which seemingly would add to the latency in processing the page fault especially if the code must be paged in from a process image that exists on a remote with that much kernel hacking stuff on it my first thought is that your windows installation is simply stuff is poison to windows and you seem to have a ton of stuff jacked into the kernel you are for and it seems trouble has come explanations are most given the amount of badware you have most likely windows is just you need a deeper technical	
not sure this is necessarily database since you could have a complex and expensive procedure more than a for applying a filter for a think a name to since the first design is simply not and it violates the if you and print the filtered you are doing multiple so you need to refactor it into and only thing different than a simple refactoring here is that it also affects in the same way that inner loops can be designed in ways that harm

not totally clear on what but this is what it sounds know how to use post and aka html to pass data between using javascript are a couple of interpretations of you doing something like my my my something my and 3 are examples of using javascript to make the buttons do 4 is a standard html form button javascript is not being the standard html form behaviors will cause the button to submit the data to whatever page is specified in the form tag like the thing to understand is that are ways to send data around between webpages between the browser and the the process of sending the data around can be triggered by html javascript function that calls a url or triggers that a form get or form elements like not intending any but the way you asked your question makes me think that not trying to figure out different formats to transfer the data to the receiving page other posters and figuring out how to parse cookie values or iterate through your form fields to create a query string would be really here are some your form was already using javascript to submit the form or 3 you just add the same onclick part to an html my function submitmyform might look something like get the form object you can also do this with the var myform use the submit method of the form in add a javascript behavior to a normal html anchor one note in users expect the rule go buttons do not a hard and fast but people generally are happier when a button is used for things like submitting form

not worth worrying too much about the hash functions of the standard jdk even if you could override string in hash function is practically always there are maybe a few certain classes such as biginteger and collections calculate their hash code every time by cycling through every single element they which is pretty spurious in some but how often do you key on instances of those designing hash codes for your own the thing trying to do is spread hash codes over the range of to do you generally want to the bits of successive fields in your object may be interested in an article on my web site that graphically illustrates the string hash code mixes multiplying the current hash by an odd number generally a prime then adding in the hash of the next element generally works sufficiently well as a first problems can occur with this method for the codes being combined tend to have zeroes in their lower generally no practical hash function absolutely guaranteed to work well in all you can consider testing your hash generate a series of random objects even use some real calculate their hash and off the 16 bits of the hash and then see how many collisions you check that the number of collisions you get roughly matches the number of collisions expect to get by for if you and off the bottom 16 bits of the hash code then after 1000 random expect about 8 after expect about 30 far as performance is then up to some i think that getting a hash code well distributed will generally be more beneficial nowadays than sacrificing hash quality for hash calculation

nothing to facilitate custom sorting logic in the been one of my chief and one of the reasons that we decided to roll our own data access layer at my old i know how feasible this would be for you to to really achieve this need to add another column to your table as an then sort the rows in an array based upon your own comparison then store the index in the array in your rather than ordering by the column order by the do that this satisfy things like automatic sorting that gets done by a and it account for changes to the data that take place after you calculate the sorting i think anything that can really help with looking to sort this check and see if your visual control supports a custom sorting about all i can

notice that in your first the simple record is sorted before record this order is also how you see the results in the regardless of whether you sort by would seem to make sense to me if the dates exactly the and the date for is before the date for instead of finding that the are exactly equal then proceeding to sort by the query finds that the dates are not equal and simply sorts by that like all the other see from browsing around that sqlite have a native understanding of date or datetime data types and instead gives users the choice of floating point numbers or text that they must parse is it possible that the literal representation of the dates in the database are not exactly most people seem to need to date so that dates behave like you would perhaps a way to wrap your order by column with a that will give you something concrete to like attending not sure that syntax but an area to look at for solving your hope that

object of type cannot be bound to a for exactly the same reason that a cannot be converted to a allowing it would allow the programmer or to break type safety without a animal dangerousshark public animal cutekitten public animal animalptrref dangerousshark an illegal function think that some of the confusion arises because of the loose use of the words and be unlike objects which can be so in the context of references when we speak of conversion we can only be concerned about initializing a new are always bound to an and from the question it was clear that he is aiming to get a reference that is a direct bind to an existing this is only allowed if the object used to initialize the reference is with the type of the this is only if the types are the or the type of the object is derived from the type of the reference and the reference type is at least as as the initializing in pointers to different types are not regardless of the relationship of the other a reference can be initialized with something that can be converted to the reference in these the reference must be const and not volatile and the conversion will create a temporary and the reference will be bound to this temporary and not the original as pointed this is not suitable for the requirements of motivating a can be bound directly to a but a cannot be directly bound to a a can be initialized with a but the reference will actually bind to a temporary object from the

of a general answer you can apply a few examples of where a tool is if you then find yourself lacking a reason to use that because similar examples never arise for then forget about it may just not be applicable to your all the data you are manipulating is in the then maybe you need linq to objects at the other it may be that thinking of it as a way of doing some extra manipulation on data from the and so missing opportunities to tighten up the expressiveness of your code that has nothing to do with the reading a file consisting of lines of plain lines it now contains an array of but arrays support so we can use linq methods on suppose you want to remove the lines with nothing in nonblanklines suppose you wanted those strings in quotes implementation need to escape existing quoted line like to line up successive operations with the aligned under each unless going to do something else with the do quoted line then suppose i want this all turned into a single string separated by a method in string called that can do if i turn it all into an array quoted line we can use a linqy way of doing quoted line a no big deal to fill in a few blanks where you find no existing operator for what you need sometimes there turns out to already be one big one that is missing is an opposite to which taken to calling for item item yield return comes in very handy when got a linked of the kind that crop up occasionally in object an example is which allows exceptions to form a linked with the innermost one at the suppose we want to display the message from the innermost exception of i helper method converts the linked list into an allowing other linq methods to work on it just needs to be given a lambda to tell it how to get to the next item from the current this will get you or maybe you need more or maybe you literally never manipulate any data that sourced from the

of an interface as a contract to define or a a general approach and not really language in context of if you are working in a single inheritance there is an excellent case to be made for preferring interfaces over classes for defining your object since that single super class pathway is fairly precious and you want to save it for something more than defining properties that are exposed on an or have icontainer semantics is a fairly poor reason to make an interface out of your better to have your folder it is doing any the already icontainer or icollection interface in your core the better choice is fairly dependent on the specific in case of your recipes that are also folders you are probably thinking of a or relationship a semantic that can be expressed using interfaces if you will have other elements in your system on things that are composed using that sort of is a bit of overhead with if you find yourself when you are done with nothing more than a set of woof and iwoof classes and then know you probably need to express your problem in terms of interfaces simple classes would have been a for any you should have at least a couple of concrete classes more meaningful names other than or that

of support for but i have to every language has plusses and minuses achieve a better balance than of being for a first convinced most people will learn to more effectively with a language that have an cycle is inherently slower for you as the programmer has garbage collection has good runtime best of if there is an interactive evaluator as to mess about not is almost invariably faster in such there are fewer things to trip you and there are better tools to help figure what went wrong when it to say learning the vagaries of memory management in a language like something worth it just the place you really want to issue with is that for all its practicality the sheer size of it added to the fact it has incompatible parts that can lead to subtle issues best avoided as a john d brings up the point in a comment that some people who learn first on a language is by no means limited to never learn pointers this is a red some people fail to learn all sorts of for all sorts of i maintain that worrying about pointers is a distraction when learning the at some point you may well need to learn about manual memory but not fundamentally important to do this at or more the gains made by avoiding this are more important than the me be clear not saying that is an inferior choice for a first language because it lacks garbage just one of many issues that get in the way of learning the fundamentals of programming the real problem is that it is a large complicated with quirks all over the place and even internal inconsistencies pointers and exceptions play well of course all of this can be managed properly and you can learn good practice to keep from getting in none of this will make much sense to a real neophyte at so some of learning it will end up being it this not that i said so you understand the details hardly an auspicious bigges gains for learning a first language though are probably in avoiding a cycle any and having good

on reading your previous i think you mean to say that you want a binary encoded rather than a is used to refer specifically to data that has been reduced in size through the application of an algorithm such as lzw in your you may find that the output is in the sense that it is smaller because for a wide variety of numbers a binary representation is more efficient than an ascii but this is not in the standard which may be why you are having trouble getting the answer you are looking think you are really asking the a number in ascii format in a for how can i write this to a file as a binary encoding are two parts to the you must convert the ascii encoded string to an integer you may use a function such as which will return a long integer equivalent in value to your ascii encoded do be aware that there are limitations on the magnitude of the number that may be represented in a long so if your numbers are very you may need to be more creative in translating you must write the data to the output stream using which does not attempt to format the bytes you give if you simply use the default stream operation to write the find that your numbers just get translated back to ascii and written out that put this all together like for for for for char char use strtol to convert to an here means the string is in as opposed hexadecimal or long intvalue convert the value to not strictly but it is good note that if you do you will have to convert back to with when you read the data netvalue create an output make sure to open the file in binary write out the data using not

on the learning curve up the silverlight a developer so i naturally picked up the data services client along the scratching my head over a scenario and seem to find any help in blogs got a complex tutor entity with related entity sets for and also got a couple other sets like subjects and along with all this come foreign keys to lookup tables for things like addresstypes business emailtypes and so all this is encapsulated in an edmx in my model a portion of the silverlight got a usercontrol that is a data entry form for this created a dto like object for the data binding to the textbox well till the user clicks save routine creates and adds a tutor and person objects and adds them to the dataservicecontext and links them where running into trouble is that i have to add a related entity already stored in the context on the database such as code the person may have multiple subject elementary elementary science the tutorsubjectset has to relate to 3 other subject subjectlevel and then to the my dto has a list of combined items that presents a of a true cartesian selection no such thing as elementary calculus at least not where i went to school that list shows up as a checkbox list on the when the user clicks save i pick up the checked items and i try to do a lookup on the combined and values against the code tables that have those is where in a be ok because i can do those lookups and get the entity in an async how do i get the related entities while busy assembling the person doing an async call in the middle of the save process tried various i tried making an replica of the subjectlevel using the and attaching that to the context as static subjectlevel var subjectlevel new subjectlevelid description effectivedate enteredby entereddate type try catch tries to catch situations where the level has already been created return approach works for situations where there are no duplicates also has the advantage that i have to do an additional for example in there will be only one home address have a similar notice i have a that catches the error if the items is already inserted into the if the item has already been inserted and i hit that the returned subjectlevel is not attached to the i get an error since the item is not being i retrieve an existing subjectlevel without issuing an async query against the subjectlevelset even if in my local like to do lev null lev i method is not which i assume means i have to do the query async so back to the same also tried to retrieve a list of subjectlevels in the loaded event that way have the set of subjectelements on hand when the save button is same i have to issue an async call to do a search even if got it i tried iterating through the list for the one i needed but that gave me an error saying that the entity was not being tracked by the clearly not understanding this and am doing it wrong but i find any practical examples that do this kind of the examples just happily load primitives into the entity to be no examples that seen show related entities and how to retrieve i could make it simple and just store integer values for the codeid and not relate them via but that would be too much of a for any help you can provide entity creation with related code

on the requirements you you seem to be needing to do much manipulation of the data in the particularly it looks like some of these can be treated as lists of data associated with the user lists of addresses and the data access code you posted already seems to be structured this i think in your scenario you have a need to make the logic side of your application more names are being treated like a list of data related to the i think you want to make the first insert of it the piece that creates the you have other information you can add to the main like interfaces consider if you are getting any out of it is a nice way to break direct dependencies between the but it look you have that scenario in the also note that declaring interfaces force you to use as you can require a property with a get to be implemented by the a type property to each of the classes used in the you can use this to reduce the code in both the interface and the data access in the you can now just loop through the list and insert all of those in the same to use something that helps you with the data like linq2sql or this will simplify the data access code and make it less error there is not a single solution for all and even in specific scenarios personal experiences will affect the way each person tackles the there are practices and principles meant to reduce but even then differences do that i suggest you read some info on ddd and they are not a recipe for these but learning about those definitely helps software about questions in the linq2sql supports stored check scott series on you loose part of the flexibility of linq2sql by using but it will help you the there are different the main issue is regarding concurrent updates to the same if concurrent updates is not an then you can just leave the latest so you just save the in that case the only original data you need is the id of the and you let the data be if you need to detect concurrent you have to either keep a copy of all the original values or use a the sp code needs to check original values match when updating the can configure linq2sql in the designer to control what type of concurrency update strategy you are using and what original values you are there are probably some in so related to how you specifically hook it will depend on the use you are giving it its generated entities or rolling your attaching sp to the entities or and even the controls you as some of them can hold original values for you

on your if that it may be helpful to post your code for to see how the saving is taking response to your second if i understand it this is how nhibernate treats mapped mapped the collection as so loading the object will load all the elements of the collection at the same when you first access the collection nhibernate will query the database to fill the collection and return when you first do something countries country in will silently execute a query similar from country where then build a collection of country objects to return cache so that the query is not run through the mapping file already told nhibernate all about your two entities and and how they are related so it knows how to build the queries to access the it keeps track of what was in the collection so when you add or remove it can compare what was changed and execute the appropriate insert or remove the way to use collections mapped by nhibernate is to use them just as you would with a normal add and remove items at your just when you are make sure you tell nhibernate to persist the changes you made to the either by calling or on every item you or you have set like you simple call on the parent object that contains the

one and most answers on thread assume that the whole collection can be constructed in you normally create a collection of anonymous type in a single if you need more you may end up with a pretty useless collection of different anonymous types are useful when you create them in a single and use them right if the creation of the collection or the further processing is a bit more the anonymous type loses some of for you efficiently pass an anonymous type along to a method for as the method know the type of the object and thus have to use reflection to get anything out of you are going to repeatedly look for items in this collection of anonymous you may want to create a named type so that you can put them in a dictionary for much faster

one way you could sort of do it only allow access to your object via a static method which takes a as a very much simplified example obviously there are many different ways of opening a file static void using stream the only things capable of creating an instance of your disposable object are methods within your own you can make sure they get used admittedly nothing to stop the delegate from taking a copy of the reference and trying to use it but not quite the same technique severely limits what you can do with your of course but in some cases it may be

only interested in merging the everything else is the fact that input0 has an and input1 has an and the expected result has an seems to suggest not worried about scaling and you want to solve this problem quickly then i would suggest writing a bit of code that uses a simple library like jdom to consider the inputs and write the output to write a generic tool that was enough to handle all of the possible merge cases would be pretty time consuming have to expose a configuration capability to define merge if you know exactly what your data is going to look like and you know exactly how the merge needs to be executed then i would imagine your algorithm would walk each xml input and write to a single xml

only reason for formatting code in a particular way is to make it this is inherently subjective do it in a way that looks good and that you feel would be more readable for someone looking at the code for the first and going to buck the conventional wisdom and worry about any common standard for two difficult in this because there are so many different possibilities for broken it buy you code formatting is simply to make your code having a standard way of formatting the particulars of your code does not buy you

only way to really do this is how the does is by setting an interval that keeps checking the current and comparing it against what it was we do this and let subscribers subscribe to a changed event that we fire if the hash its not perfect but browsers really support this event to keep this answer you are using jquery today should be somewhat foundational for then a nice solution is to use the abstraction that jquery gives you by using its events system to listen to hashchange events on the window work nice thing here is you can write code that need to even worry about hashchange however you do need to do some in form of a somewhat lesser known jquery feature special this feature you essentially get to run some setup code for any the first time somebody attempts to use the event in any way as binding to the this setup code you can check for native browser support and if the browser natively implement you can setup a single timer to poll for and trigger the jquery completely unbinds your code from needing to understand this support the implementation of a special event of this kind is trivial get a simple working but why do that somebody else has

other ways line the registry is appropriate for many kinds of configuration by choosing a suitable place in the you can make some configuration some configuration sound like your application but mention it or any combination of the windows manages the storage of the data and provides a rudimentary way for users to edit it the registry makes it more difficult to run more than one instance of your program with different options at the same can store configuration information in a text file on this allows you to keep the configuration in the same place as the which makes it easier to find using the you have to tell the user where to configuration files can usually be edited with a regular text generally you will have to specify what format is to be used and to read and parse the text handling syntax errors if method allows you to easily run more than one instance of your each with its own separate configuration file your app looks in its own directory for the config for line program can read its configuration information from the command but you still have to store the data somewhere the command line can only support a limited amount of information before it gets program could read its configuration information from environment these might be variables that are set by a script that runs your programs you have the same problems as command line the data must still be stored somewhere or might be a globally set environment variable supplied by the windows provides very primitive tools for changing the global less accessible than even this choice is not often used on is an advanced technique that requires cooperation with some other program that the data into shared like many other the data must still be stored somewhere else in the first not recommended unless you really know you need

others are very right to mention that you are almost certainly falling into the pit of premature when they say that trigonometric functions are not telling the whole trigonometric function implementations are actually in the value of the input this is because the trig functions are most efficiently calculated on a small interval like for the best even smaller parts of this but that one suffices to explain so the algorithm looks something like in series approximation of some or or perhaps a function requires 0 x if x x while x x return microcoded cpu instructions like the end up doing something like this so trig because they are usually take time to do the argument there are two you have to calculate a ton of values off the principal domain of the trig your math is probably not very well thought notation hides a constant argument reduction has a very small constant because simple to thus the part is going to dominate the part for just about every

others have said about operator precedence seems to be but i think there is a bigger issue you really need zillions of to model this sure found out by now that this method is not trying to change anything in that pile of ifs is going to be a real pain and very error thing i would do is separate the calculation for the discount from the calculation for the this way you do not have to manually calculate every possible combination of discount and what talking double int const double const int const double the discount is 50 for each scaled so that year 1 year 2 is and so double discount year 50 this calculation assumes that speed int feemultiplier double fine feemultiplier return discount the the discount and fine are combined only one this is just figuring out what formula is used to calculate the fine and then implementing if the fine were defined in a more arbitrary manner then perhaps a table would be	
others have there is no such thing as a loop in a file system if you realize that the path is part of a file unless its a cyclical symbolic if you bootstrap some distro say to a loop or even to a and do this on a debian you have now duplicated a lot of lets say you are running debian and bootstrap a minimal copy of it to is going to be the same as there is no way of avoiding already calling a on each node assuming using you may as callback insert the name of the node into an that has structure members that can store a hash of the file which is unlikely to md5 going to cut it for a hash table based on that digest and the file name in no danger of speeding up your but it will significantly cut down on time it takes to you use threads correctly and set the hashing and indexing can happen on one core while the other is bound multiple cores are checking for duplicate mounts is not going to be a plus sure your program would want to return the locations of all files named even if there are four identical copies to	
others prefer to if was an issue a naming convention like this will make the code completely unmaintainable after the first week of working on the the code will get to be near and when writing the code people will constantly have to think about things like abbreviated or was it a huge mental tax to pay while writing code that will result in far lower top of the problem is exacerbated by the fact that in javascript you will get a new variable for every mistyped of	
others the cast removes the of the destination as far as the expression is when you use a cast the compiler treats the expression according to the cast as long as the cast itself it valid casts are pretty much the big this is why you get an error or essentially telling the i know what this is how you should treat in casts are probably the way for programmers to get the compiler to stop issuing assignment expression may or may not be undefined it is permitted to cast away constness the object actually pointed to is not if the object pointed to is then you have undefined void const const float float x const float y well defined not particularly great undefined return treading dangerous general sure there are casting so that expressions treat objects as they really are is behavior in particular behavior is covered in the standards mostly by statements that modifying a const object through a cast that removes the const qualifier is the inference is that doing the same for a object is not an example given in the standard makes this type qualifiers an attempt is made to modify an object defined with a type through of an lvalue with the behavior is the pointer or reference to a type need not actually point or refer to a but it is treated as if it a access path cannot be used to modify an object even if the object referenced is a object and can be modified through some other access supported by the type system so that they cannot be subverted without casting that any class member declared mutable can be any attempt to modify a object during its lifetime results in undefined i to const access path to attempt to modify through ptr to needed to convert const points to a ciq new const int as iq modifies a const

our large based project we now have a method to automatically generate code to expose our code as soap this works really and we are planning to start implementing an ria based application using adobe air flex based on the we have question i have is about organizing soap the code i have exposes individual method calls which in our code belong to thus far i have named the exposed methods by prefixing them with the name of the class which they came from in ideally there would be a way to group methods logically within the soap service so that i have to take this step and it would be possible to ask for the services in a particular group once you have bound to the soap services using the wsdl file in your target really like to be able to reproduce the class structure that lies behind the soap layer on the server side in our client right i can see that i could do this by using the method names to determine what class they belong but if i could separate them in a cleaner way i would prefer forward to hearing what you soap gurus know about this there a way to group a set of soap methods logically in a type

per other using a cname should only cause very minimal additional dns resolution and only if the result is not already in the recursive dns that dns clients routinely ask explicitly for cname typically ask for whatever record type they actually want for a web browser that would be an or the job of the upstream servers to recognise that the queried domain name has a cname entry in and then look up and return the target in this case both the cname record and the required result are returned in the of the dns response not in the as someone else optimum performance best that the target of the cname be hosted on the same authoritative dns server as the domain name that contains the cname so that the cname resolution can be done without further dns

power of power user is basically an administrator so a user to power user does not provide any increase in security to the system you might as well be on interactively as a normal of course a developer needs administrative access to their developer machine servers and second boxes and so but of course noone should interactively log on as administrator during normal development or use a normal user account for this and most seriously do not want to run any client and so as an normally log onto your linux box as root even if you likely have root access when you need a separate personal administrator the developer with a separate personal administrator account to machine account that is also a valid administrator on other servers and boxes that person needs administrative access and in uac to prompt or request prompt and enter the administrative credentials for tasks and processes only when pki with smartcards or similar can greatly reduce the strain in entering credentials is happy audit this way and an easy way to find out who is using the terminal services sessions on a particular server you have to access right definitely development work that will never require local administrator privileges like most web development where deployment is tested against a separate server or virtual machine and where cassini or whatever is used for local debugging actually runs well as a normal

prefer option for a number of integration tests usually require your db schema to be and launching a to upgrade the schema will be a huge you cannot change database schema while your site is running add a couple of indexes to speed things for production side of upgrading your database in transaction installation is much better than attempting to upgrade at each app startup since you can potentially end up with desynchronized if looking for the migration take a look at

pretty basic knowledge that as a our output is channelled through a keyboard upon which we must if we type slower than we then a bottleneck for our and our have both blogged about this in recent challenged my girlfriend to a friendly game of typing of the and found my ass sorely only able to do about 70 wpm to her but i did notice that on i was much i then started paying attention to how she was typing with her fingers on the home row compared to with my right hand angled so my little finger always rests on the shift this is obviously because as a constantly typing a large assortment of punctuation marks most of which require to my point if you were interested in their typing speed reasons outlined in the blogs how valid would it be then to ask a potential recruit their given that normal typing tests examine your proficiency at typing in rather than in if you believe not appropriate to use standard typing tests for do you know of any method to find their i that a typing speed is waaay down the list of things which are obviously no ever going to hire a crappy programmer just because they can type a typing test for

principle still you are not going to have to worry about adding fields to tables etc until you have a lot of quite a lot of so worrying too much too early about the details of indexing and query plans without seeing actual data is going to often be wasted time and even lead to architectural problems mucking about with the database design after a production release can be pretty scary if a good process is not so even more so than you want to get it right first time with a you do want to plan for getting the data out as well as putting it in and storing so if your features include that will affect the design of the database a so maybe plan for is not as easy to tweak a schema as adding a but it is yagni still	
principles of by william kritina and jill principles of of this biggest issues i have with many programs i have used is the lack of design put into the interface and into the this book goes describing how to enhance the usablilty within a it also tells you all of the basic principals and rules of and they give many examples for many different applications whether its techinical or the book reads a little like a college classroom book it probably is for many design so it the not the most exciting thing to but i find the most informative when it comes to interface

probably be storing the virtualized build as a giant if you want to version your you version the source not the compiled many shops do is store in version control the to recreate the build then you need one fixed image os plus a small number of files to install on and some places even have their server rebuild the app from on a clean os for every the os image itself as a giant binary nearly as you you you the you might save space if your vcs can do binary but that probably takes a ton of cpu and memory to and if on a is then no reason to make life painful just to save disk store your install in vc and rebuild the vm image as or just store vm images in normal i see any point in putting the images in

probably find an assertion in on line have a look at that source file to see what checking for you be and then stop doing it you have the source then have to whoever wrote it and find out what the assertion the api docs to see if doing something assertion is a check that coder use to ensure rules are being followed or unexpected situations are caught before any real damage is things like a doubly linked list becoming corrupt something like assert which will assert a problem if node previous node have node a as a next my mythical language in case i have the c syntax at the start of a function will raise an assertion if p1 is equal to web search turns up the following at line 345 not an ole control at it looks to be a problem with the fact that trying to dynamically create a licensed activex that link also contains a kb number q151804 which says that by design means ms probably have fixed you need to create the control with a valid license other comment that i found is not sufficient to just create an instance of activex an activex control has to be properly hosted before it can be yours you need put it on a dialog and create an instance of that seeing the rest of your hard to tell if this is your specific but if line 345 is the one i think it that makes sense complaining that the control site is null the control is not final thing to watch out your activex control in a are you trying to do something to the control you call the control will only be initialized after you call so you cannot play with the control until after you should do this in the dialogs at that the control should be fully initialized and you can do what you want with trying to use parameters from the dialogs constructor to manipulate the you need to store them somewhere in the and transfer them to the control in information was gathered mostly from

probably mean template method are they serve very similar would say it is better to use template method in cases when you have a algorithm having defined steps where subclasses override these steps to change some case of you need to create an and instead of inheritance you are using i would say it is a bit more powerful pattern and maybe better in accordance to dip dependency inversion it is more powerful because you clearly define a new abstraction of strategy a way of doing which does not apply to template if this abstraction makes sense use using template method may give you simpler designs in simple which is also which words fit do you have a template or is the key thing here that you have an abstraction of strategy new way of doing something of a template you inherit from application and substitute what exactly will be done on run and of a when writing a you do not inherit from an array delegates the comparison algorithm to a	
probably need to be more specific about what you the key thing to know is that when bouncing the the angle of incidence equals the angle of in pong like they usually alter the angle based on the part of the paddle that it hit if the paddle were an using a it has a start point and a if the start point is the left side of the screen then you are in because the normal slope intercept formula works mx m is slope and b is the where it crosses the value of y when x is then increment x some amount and calculate on the return you can do this m is 0 when the vector is perfectly when it hits the to preserve angle of incidence angle of reflection you just need to use for the position on the if you have any comment on this answer or update your question and i will try to provide more

probably process the information in the log as it reads this means it have to allocate a huge amount of memory to store the it can read a process it and throw it it is a usual and very effective way to process could for example work line by line and parse each for the actual parsing you can write a state machine or if the requirements allows use approach would be a state machine that both reads and parses the if for some reason a log entry spans more than one line this might be state machine related simple state machine written in of python related but some sections are universally

problem with using a progress bar is often a process takes multiple different so if i were doing a progress dialog for a software i use a single progress but a task list with check marks so the user can see what task is being performed at the a progress bar next to the task if taking longer than 10 seconds so they can see that work is being done and they abort it too running tasks are nice because past performance strongly indicates future the first 10 seconds will likely show you how long the remainder of the file same with the update processes need a progress so even display one on any process until that one process has taken 10 seconds or that way the user on a fast system just sees a checkmark on each and on a slow system the user sees the and if it stays on a task they get the progress bar with actually useful the progress bar make any promises about how long the later tasks will an overall time at the bottom that covers best guess for all tasks is very but i show that on a progress thing about progress bars is they are meant to travel when they jump and stutter very frustrating for the user they are actually less useful and give the wrong information in that the right tool for the too many times a progress bar is chosen when actually the wrong	
problem you have is that ironpython classes are not python classes are much more dynamic than classes so ironpython classes are typically you subclass a interface in ironpython it create a new but multiple python classes will actually share a backing class one class will be created for every type subclassed in correct way to do this is to use python introspection to collect the ironpython class objects and use a factory function you can use as a delegate casting the returned instance to the where you need to instantiate you could try executing in the python

professional apps are in your you would probably layer it like the two distinct depending on how complex the app the service other layers to support client the database store would be something like some tables in an oracle or microsoft sql and would on your layer would be your code that retrieves and stores data your it might also contain business which are basically classes that have properties representing your data from your the benefit of the data access layer is that sometimes reading and writing to a database can require specialized and you want that code sprinkled throuought your so instead you can call functions in your data access layer that loads needed data into so the rest of your application is just interacting with a regular old these are called which stands for something like plan old clr there are lots of variations on this of as people have taken different approaches to the problem of isaloting database also it serves the purpose of minimizing breaking changes whenever the database since the database access logic is not sprinkled throughout the then there are fewer places that need to be updated if the database changes as adding new columns to a table or changing a the business layer will be own and would contain most of the of the it would sit between the data access and web service using concepts from service oriented architecture you might have an authentication and a web request handling these services are a lot like a class that is always there waiting to process your web request handling service would take a and maybe first call into the authentication service to verify credentials before honoring the soa is one of those things i think should be used only when it some cases just using object oriented techniques will give you the same not always when done is more so it really depends on whether soa offers you additional benefits that you webservice would be responsible for receiving requests from the and acting on those requests by making calls into your business layer to update or retrieve the concept here would be that you could have many users of your service who publish their song updates through your client would have a service layer which would be responible for formatting requests into sending them to the web and retrieving messages from the web you would put very little application in your web service all this is probably overkill and inefficient for what you are wanting to do since you just want something for but the basic anatomy of a lot of webservice applications and would be a good learning the whole purpose of the layers is decoupling and while more makes the application overall more it means each component is this means easier to wrap your head around problems when you are only dealing with one component which interacts with only a couple other sourounding so there is a careful balance between few components and many too few and they become monolithic and difficult to too and they become intertwined in complex i have heard it said something along the lines of a class is getting too big and too then split it up into a few more in start subdividing stuff for the heck of it just because it sounds like the right thing to evaluate how complex your component is going to be before deciding if you want to split it sometimes for simple cases your have a layer serving more than one for the sake of getting it done faster and making the overall design the point apply these concepts where you will learn what is appropriate with and you obviously understand that you can learn the most by vbscript call a com you can compile dlls with com many older things can call com vbscript got script and that safe to your webservice will be where you would be most concerned with safe only if you design with security in mind and screw we all screw up sometimes which means there is no guarantee of it being perfectly

project managers necessarily have a programming they should be familiar with the stages of the software development life cycle but that the same as programming to my the natural way of evolution is into team lead or group manager which is different than project pm should be a good maanger with a basic understanding of a software development methodology and people skills to handle the execution of the project plan and its there necessarily a need for fundamental knowledge about the technology i use since in a sense that can become quite the rabbit hole to jump how much about iis and would they have to know and then the differences between versions that can add some more to the had pretty good experience with each kind of manager in terms of project some that came from a programming background gave the ease of bonding over horror stories in using this or that for developing stuff and i enjoyed working with them as some ideas ever seem to go out of others that seem to have a technical background may still be good if they have the other key attributes like attention to methodical and creativity to handle changes to the which is the same as writing to my mind is almost purely design and implementation which ignores the other elements of designing software which includes the earlier stages like requirements gathering and analysis as well as the end stages of deployment and

question is a little i wrote an algorithm for breaking up a into convex but now having trouble proving that optimal minimal number of convex polygons using my prof is adamant that it be done with a greedy algorithm such as this but i think of a if anyone can prove my algorithm is suboptimal i would appreciate easiest way to explain my algorithm with pictures are from an older suboptimal my algorithm is extends the line segments around the point i across until it hits a point on the opposite there is no vertex within this it creates a new one red and connects to there one or more vertices in the it connects to the closest this produces a decomposition with the fewest number of convex in some cases it can fail in the following if it happens to connect the middle green line this will create an extra unneeded to this i propose double checking all the edges and check that they are all still if remove some this is not see this and with would yield a better in this scenario no edges to remove so this poses a in this case i suggest an order of when deciding which vertex to connect a reflex vertex it should choose the vertex with the highest closest closest reflex closest reflex that is also in range when working backwards to we can see that the reflex vertex 9 chose to connect to 12 it was when it would have been better to connect to both vertices 5 and 12 are in the range as defined by the extended line segments and but vertex 5 should be given preference because 9 is within the range given by and but not in the range given by and the edge elimates the reflex vertex at but does not eliminate the reflex vertex at but it can eliminate the reflex vertex at so 5 should be given is possible that the edge will still exist with this modified but it can be removed during there any cases by john this is missing the bits under figures 3 and vertices in are given in ccw mean that if is being compared with then is in the range given by the rays and each vertex if is find the closest point of intersection given by the ray starting at and extending in the direction of this lower repeat for the ray given by this upper if there are no vertices along boundary of the polygon in the range given by the upper and lower create a new vertex exactly half way between the lower and upper bound points and upper will lie on the same connect to this new iterate along the vertices in the range given by the lower and upper for each vertex if is a if no other good reflexes have been save it any other vertex if it is closer then the other good reflexes save if no good reflexes have been found and it is closer than the other vertices save connect to the best repeat entire algorithm for both halves of the polygon that was just no reflex vertices then is out there is one more case i algorithm will attempt to connect vertex 1 to unless i add another check to make sure it so i propose stuffing everything the onto a priority queue using the priority scheme i mentioned then take the highest priority check if it can if pop it off and use the i this makes my algorithm n log if i optimize it for a little more maybe this put together that loosely describes my i tend to move stuff so get it while to convex

question is about the way in which git handles whenever you branch from a this branch ever receive changes from the parent branch unless you it with a in other systems such us clearcase or you can specify how branches get filled with sort of inheritance i with using a you can say all the files modified on branch and then continue with the ones on or with this specific accurev you also have a similar mechanism which streams receive changes from upper branches how they call without merging or creating a new commit on the you miss this while using can you enumerate scenarios where this is a please read vonc answer below to actually focus my once we agree and dag based scms have different my question are the real life scenarios for companies more than where linear can do things not possible for are they vs static branching vs	
question is actually not language agnostic at in some languages you could easily decorate the but stick to even there i say apparent thing we would like to do is some sort of of the for annotate your handlers with a then scan for all classes annotated with the messy way that basically requires the class files to be loaded or using something like you are running in a context such as an even more interesting option you can get all beans implementing a certain such as the interface void then find them in your dispatcher handlers handler method handlemethod type the code above is realize i go out of the boundaries my point is that the elegance of the solution depends on your language of what external tools you are willing to use and what framework you are	
question is lacking specifics needed for a good answer but give it a triggers are good for targeting tables but if you are interested in writes then need a better method that is easier to for writes investigate methods that detect changes in the transaction each vendor implements this part so one method that works for all vendors is not that a method that works within the database server is but there may be more elegant ways outside of the server at the os for if the transaction log is a file on disk then a simple script of some sort that detects changes in the file would indicate the db was written in mind you have asked only to detect a db if you need to know what type of write it was then need to get into the transaction log to see what is and that will definitely be vendor	
question is mainly geared towards zend in although it certainly applies to other languages and so i welcome only recently been using the zend and while not i have had a pretty good time with one thing that drives me is that most of the examples i see of people using zend do the in special form rather than in the i think this is bad practice because data can enter into the system in other ways beyond form which means that either validators have to be bent and twisted to validate other or validation must be done in a second and logic found some other posts and blogs out there with people who feel the same way i but the developers of zend made this choice for a and other people seem to use it without so i wanted to get some feedback from the community i this mainly applies to although i think important to look at the issue as a rather than working within the confines of the zend since zend was designed so that you could use as or as as you validation be done in form or the

question is similar to to concisely cascade through multiple regex statements in except instead of matching one regular expression and doing something i need to make sure i do not match a bunch of regular and if no matches are found i have valid then do i have found one way to do it but am thinking there must be a better especially if i end up with many regular i am filtering for bad stuff that occurs when i yank what looks like a valid url out of an html document but it turns out to be part of a javascript thus needs to be and thus the escaping i use beautiful soup to process these pages since they are far to mangled i use then fall back to my ugly but workable far i have found the following works relatively i compile a dict or regular expressions outside the main loop i only have to compile it but benefit from the speed increase every time i use i then loop a url through this if there is a match then the url is if not the url is pattern in match if do stuff here the obvious thought is to use regex reduces the number of compares and but makes it much harder to trouble shoot one expression per compare i can easily add a print statement matched by key is there someway to get the best of both worlds minimal number of yet still be able to print out which regex is matching the or do i simply need to bite the bullet and have my slower but easier to troubleshoot code when debugging and then squoosh all the together into one line for means one more step of programming and code maintenance and possible answer by dave so the actual code for this would look do stuff here for print matched multiple negative regex to expression in	
question leads on to some fun diversions concerning the nature of python objects and garbage probably helpful to understand that all variables in python are really that is they are names in a namespace as a whch point to an address in memory where the object actually for the value of an uninitialized variable is the same as asking for the value of the thing a pointer points to when the pointer has not yet been created obviously nonsense which is why the most sensible thing python can do is throw a meaningful oddity of the python language is that possible that an object exists long before you execute an assignment you magically create an object nope it already since is an immutable singleton there are already a few hundred pointers to commment by jfs here to show the a 1 integers less than 256 are b 1000

question relates to question on jena ontmodel i have jena models on two machines that need to remain synchronized over the main issue that i need to address is that the models may contain anonymous nodes which can originate in any of the am i on the right track or is there a more robust approach that failing to can think of 3 approaches to this the complete this is prohibitively expensive for synchronizing small since changes can occur on either i just replace machine model with the serialized model from machine i need to merge a partial use a dedicated model for serialization that only contains the changes that need to be sent over the this approach requires special vocabulary to represent statements that were from the when i serialize the model from machine a to machine anonymous node ids will be unique to machine a but may overlap with ids for anonymous nodes created on machine have to rename anonymous nodes and keep a mapping from machine anon ids to machine ids in order to handle future changes individual this approach requires no special but may not be as are there issues other than anonymous nodes that i just encountered globally unique bnode ids we can generate globally unique ids for anonymous nodes by prefixing the id with a unique machine i figured out to tell jena to use my id instead of its this would allow us to serialize individual statements without remapping bnode an example to ground this discussion a bit suppose i have a list on machine a represented serialize this model from machine a to machine because machine b may already have an anonymous node with id i remap id to a new id the list changes on machine machine b has never encountered machine id it adds a new mapping from machine id to a new id problem is further complicated with more than two if there is a third machine for it may have own anonymous node that is different from machine anonymous node machine b really does need to keep a map from each of the other anonymous node ids to its local not just from remote ids in general to local when processing incoming it must take into account where the changes came from to map the ids jena ontmodels with

quicksort is often a better choice than merge there are definitely times when merge sort is thereotically a better the most obvious time is when extremely important that your algorithm run faster than quicksort is usually faster than but given the theoretical worst possible it could run in which is worse than the worst possible merge is also more complicated than especially if you want to write a really solid and so if aiming for simplicity and merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance

real advantage of the fully normalized version in the first answer comes when the requirements change when someone changes the specs so you have to add types beyond the 3 those changes do normalized structure should let you do that more without needing to change either table structure or most of the programs that use the the normalized structure does require more investment in the beginning every new transaction involves inserting into 2 you need to have a check constraint to control the do better in the long term with the normalized with a simple case lik you can sometimes get away without normalizing and not have to pay the consequences nobody has to pay until long gone and somebody reasonable levels of normalization should be your standard strategy and you should require yourself to have very good reasons for	
real best answer really depends on what you need the data for and how important it i usually keep all system data for my with the virtual the real important stuff goes into a persistent this is a vm drive which affected by i know how many times i have lost information because of of my reside on dedicated usb hard i have found this extremely handy because i can move them easily to any other machine runing vm you use the file server always has to be running for your other to relying on it to seems a little cumbersome to	
realize this what you but something you might discovered that you can find the integer value of an enum without a if you know what the minimum value enum complexity low normal medium high 3 valueofhigh work with unless you added some minimal value of or added 1 enum priority normal medium high urgent 4 valueofurgent find this technique much more aesthetically appealing than casting to not sure off the top of my head what happens if you have an enum based on byte or long i suspect that get byte or long difference

really does the lib expose only functions where memory is either managed by straight win32 methods or the caller never frees memory allocated by the callee or do you only rely on basic libraries that changed much since vs if you should be are 2 basic things to watch changes to global variables used by and changes to the structure of etc defined by those for the crt memory allocator has probably changed its hidden allocation management structures between the 2 so having one version of the library allocate a piece of memory and having another free it will probably cause a another if you expose classes through the interface and they rely on ms runtime libraries like a chance that the class layout has changed between vs 6 and vs that means that accessing a on the class could go to the wrong thing and cause unpredictable probably hosed if the uses mfc in any mfc defines and internally uses tons of and any access to mfc globals by the operations in the could cause failures if the mfc infrastructure has changed in the hosting environment has changed a lot since vs explored exactly what changes were made in the mfc but seen unpredictable behavior between class binaries compiled in different vs top of those a risk for functions like that rely on static global variables defined in the not but concerned those static variables may not get initialized properly if you use a client expecting the crt on a thread created on the look at the documentation for for more

really help finding out the font used as any given user might have a different default font set up on their web browser and different web browsers will probably have different default fonts you want your imagebutton to use the same font as the linkbutton need to specify the font the drawback to this is that unless you pick one of the common fonts no guarantee that all users will have this font you can specify alternate but that really help here as you specify alternate do you need to use an image that contains you post an image of what like to did write some css to make text have a button like background though it was for classic windows button but sure that someone with more css knowledge than me could take it if you think be helpful go and dig it out and post it the sans

really need to understand forms and css to get i say forms as this will give you the round trip needed to understanding the stateless nature of web further labour the i have interviewed many people who think you can only have one form on a page and can only have one submit button per this is all down to a lack of foundation for that recommend starting with a lot of web development is done with gone are the days where you do it yourself but my above point still you do need to be able to peep under the hood with some been doing web development for 12 years and started out with perl on solaris and since then also done java and more recently slowly falling for django in my private found over the years is that the inherent problems authentication are all the same but just handled so ultimately its down to you and your language plus a little of enlightened self interest when it comes to potential you should also become familiar with web servers and iis spring to http codes and mime types and encoding and as well as javascript browser platforms and good development practises such as using fiddler and so it also hurt to have a good idea of the image formats image css content caching and the depends on where you want to a pick django and clean language with cheap startup low cost ides and hosting your sites is very just a subjective

really want to synchronize on an since you have control over what instances are the same and what instances are java just provide such a facility using integers in a small that is dependable across different if you really must synchronize on an then you need to keep a map or set of integer so you can guarantee that getting the exact instance you would be to create a new perhaps stored in a that is keyed by the to synchronize something like page page p if synchronized p locks new object integer return explain this it uses which allows use of you could do new then you incur the cost of creating an object for each to avoid i just save the integer itself in the what does this why is this any different from just using the integer you do a from a the keys are compared with at least the method used is the equivalent of using two different integer instances of the same value will be equal to each you can pass any number of different integer instances of as the parameter to and you will always get back only the very first instance that was passed in that contained that are reasons why you may not want to synchronize on you can get into deadlocks if multiple threads are synchronizing on objects and are thus unwittingly using the same locks when they want to use different you can fix this risk by using new and thus incurring a small cost to each access to the doing you guarantee that this class will be doing its synchronization on an object that no other class will be synchronizing always a good

refer to any length of a single operation could take ms on a webservice and 100 seconds in a database and they both could be using hard to know quite what if asking whether accessing a local database is generally faster than accessing a similar service over the then i expect the answer is that the local database will be the call over the internet to the web service has a lot of overhead and communication over internet is relatively evan on a slow computer a databases can perform many thousands of simple queries per contrast that with access over the where be lucky to get 50 round trip requests per not even accounting for time it takes to perform the requested operation on the asking whether a server on the web can serve data faster by avoiding a database and calculating results then the answer is it the call to the database in this case adds unnecessary overhead if the data in it can be easily calculated in a the answer to this question really have anything to do with a is it faster to calculate an answer in a function or to access the answer using a query on a as i the answer would depend on the complexity of the particular function you had to and weighing its computation time against the overhead of accessing the answer part of the directly from a the answer to your question depends on what exactly it would also probably help to know asking the i have a suspicion that the real answer is that this probably something you need to worry not really a practical concern unless you have a particular situation requiring concerned about comparison of speed when webservice and database are both on a pretty sure the overhead of the db is a less than the the application typically maintains a stateful to the while requests to a webservice are via which is relatively higher and could be best answer would be to whip up a simple and measure time it takes to retrieve results using both and create an app that opens a lot of threads and do some load if your app maintain an open connection or have access to a pool of connections with the then the db alternative may well be initial creation of a db connection can be relatively but that figure into since you should write your app so that an open connection is always

reports by developer is a horrible as a qa lead i have argued against this time and time bugs how they are dealt with when they do is more better metric is what the bug reopen rate in other when qa logs a which is then is the bug fixed or is there something that was causing qa to reopen the more often this it is a clue that the developer may not be paying real attention to the this is of that the bug was intelligently logged in the first preferably with steps to the actual the expected and screen shots this is just one metric on which to other possibilities the developer meet promised to client of any required probably i have done both development and qa and was lucky enough during my development time not to have bug counts used against me in i argue against it at my current company in my current role because it is an unreliable metric we used reopen rate as a compromise to make upper management dev happy that they have something to report i am not a manager and actually generate any reports myself case the cause of some

respect to your needing to reference the business layer from the i would agree that this is probably not optimal lower tiers should not know about the ones above it reduces reusability and adds circular you considered having your business entities themselves and do their own persistence operations using the dal rather than the dal acting like a factory for them in your current that your dal would be a more direct representation of the and the business entities would contain the logic needed to fill and persist themselves the layer you spec out really appear to me to contain business it looks to me to be more of a persistence services layer for the a variation of what you propose could referencing business contains interfaces and classes with business references dataservices contains classes that find and persist can serve up structures containing the data transfer that can be consumed and processed by business references which simply provides classes that map to on your i would consider merging your businessentities and dataservices in your original into a single the only reason i can think of to split them apart is if you are doing something like silverlight where you need asynchronous data operations on business course all of this is with an incomplete knowledge of your specific system requirements you will need to design what is best for your specific good	
response is but to answer your question more explicitly about resharper and why the case of a reference type a check for null would since that is considered the value for a reference for a value type as a the will never be since your serializableentity and unserializableentity are you can specify them to be either reference or value so the null check your doing is probably not what you what you would want to check is to make sure that the parameter is something that you really want to concern yourself in the case of a reference you want to concern yourself with null in the case of a value you want to concern yourself with an say you specify a datetime to be the data type dealing do you really want to be adding datetimes that do not have any value the default value for a datetime is not so you would need to check for that using not

results you are getting are consistent with 32bit without knowing more about your not possible to advise what to the code shown is ie not converting anything to strings or then there a fix within outside of the code and depends on the patrick mcdonald and treb brought both up the accuracy of your inputs and the error on i thought take a look at one technique to look at rounding errors is interval which makes the upper and lower bounds which value represents explicit are implicit in floating point and are fixed to the precision of the by treating each value as an upper and lower and by extending the bounds by the error in the representation approx x 2 for a double value x you get a result which gives the lower and upper bounds on the accuracy of a taking into account worst case precision if you have a value in the range and subtract from it a value in the range then the result must lie in the range as the minimum result is and the maximum is and are equivalent to floor and but for the next representable value rather than for intervals which represent double a b c d double precision although is small compared to or it is still large compared to double so if you were using the worst imaginable double precision then you could trust that to be precise to 12 figures lost a few figures off double but still working to more than your if the inputs were only accurate to the number significant then rather than being the double value then the input range would be so you get the a b c d specified accuracy is a much wider you would have to go out of your way to track the accuracy in the and the rounding errors inherent in floating point are not significant in this example precise to 12 figures with the worst case double precision the other if your inputs are only known to 6 it actually matter whether you get or both are within

safest approach is to fall back to the lowest version you need to that assumes all versions are backwards compatible which necessarily the that solution appropriate or desirable then i fall back to the is by far the most popular and common di framework but no means the only is another you can even roll your own if undesirable to add a complete framework for i have problems envisioning a java a i do without using simply too say there are 4 versions of a relevant the api has changed twice in that time so you have 3 different api you need to abstract use of that jar to an api of your own that is consistent across all these versions and then create three implementations of one for each different api spring you create an application which defines all your beans and how injected into other there is no reason you choose or build and application context as part of a build often properties are used for this but you could also include part of the application context this way key point here is that even though the apis are different you need to abstract away those differences as far as your code is if you just asking for trouble and it just gets

said that you have potentially in moments of and that most of them are i suspect most of us are like do you tell which ideas are bad and which are usually impossible to do so without trying them if willing to go out and work on at least showing that you have confidence in that if you willing why am i to have confidence in your give me some reason to believe somebody thinks it a good you could try patenting which last i heard cost about ten thousand dollars or more in the but that could also turn me against the do you handle a situation where i might have had the same and for whatever reason pursue not interested in giving you money if i implement an idea i came up with if you tell me the i can always or claim i had it not interested in signing anything that restricts my actions in the future the ability to profit off an enterprise without cutting you unless i get something for also not interested in putting myself in the crosshairs of a lawsuit if i start a business and you think it was from your i have no business reason to listen to your idea unless i already have some confidence it will be profitable to and for that see the paragraph come to i have you have why should i pick an idea that gives you a cut of the when i can pick an idea i had i probably overestimate the value of my own but you probably do see people making lots of money for no particularly good an author cleaning up on a book not all that a financial analyst getting millions while bankrupting his that sort of what you see is that those people put in a lot of time and work to get into that where they could profit if willing to put in that maybe you can get an undeserved profit if you have an idea that could be worth get a start on try to profit from it without something to preferably something that shows off advantages without giving away the whole that shows that one at has some confidence in the it puts you out in if only and demonstrates that probably the logical person to keep going with the it allows you to discuss possible ways to exploit it without giving away the whole it allows me to save rather than admit that you have better ideas than it allows me to finance you on the basis of something expect somebody to pay you just for being smarter than they if you they want to admit if why should they pay

same approach is used for the saml web browser sso the primary motivations of using html post redirection are unlimited length of the payload in saml the payload is a xml document signed with xmldsig and base64 it is larger than the usual 1024 characters limitation of url best practice to support not only any browsers but intermediary network devices like reverse load balancer as http standard says that get is idempotent same url get executed multiple times should always result in same and consequently can be cached along the way while post is not and must reach the url response of an openid html form post or saml html form post should not be it must reach the target in order to initiate the authenticated could argue that using a http get redirection would work as well since the url query always change and you would be right is this would be a workaround of the w3c and should not be a standard but an alternate implementation whenever both end agree with

say you come from a cocoa background so assuming not talking about most webframeworks that say they do mvc are actually using a different pattern called front a bit of a different story from normal mvc because you need quite a lot of plumbing to make that hence all the mvc frameworks in the originally mvc was a pattern for for these applications you can make mvc work without needing a is a pattern that can be implemented in any object oriented no reason why you do it in the only reason i can think of why people would call mvc on java a approach is that the ui libraries on java like swing do not actually require you to do they just give you the tools to implement a have to create controller and model classes about what is are usually not really constructive mvc is a pattern developed for smaltalk about 30 years none of the implementations that are used now are exactly the same many implementations are got different flavours called and they are all usefull in some the important thing to take away from this is that its a good idea to separate your ui logic from your application java can do this and so can most other people claiming otherwise are probably just afraid to look outside the language comfortable

second algorithm creates a chain of lambda each containing a reference to the previous i know exactly what ruby but in a properly language the stack would not overflow in your second because in the lambda is also in tail as experiment ruby have proper tail the chain of nested calls to the lambda will overflow the stack when the head of the chain is even though ruby is smart enough to convert the call into a loop	
second approach is more and it is clear when reading the code that the function has no preconditions on the argument does not have an and that it will actually create an object the first approach is not so clear for the casual the call implies that the object will be changed by but it is not so clear if there are any preconditions on the passed the the code you posted is not using the assignment but rather copy the defines the value that is implemented in all major if you are not sure you can run the following snippet in your x const x const x const const x return x x you will get a single line the compiler reserves the space in the stack for the then calls the function that constructs the over fact the operations inside are applied directly on being equivalent to your first code snippet by you were not using the copy constructor you x then it would create both and and apply the assignment yielding a three line so it could be a little less efficient in

server application receives information about rows to add to the database at a rate of rows per all day there are two columns in the table that uniquely identify a one is a numeric identifier called and the other is a 50character string called a row can have either a tag or a not row that comes in off the socket may or may not already exist in the if it that row must be updated with the new if it it must be we are using sql 2005 and in a few cases even sql so we cannot use the new merge way i am doing this now is to build a giant delete statement that looks like from tag tag longtag tag each incoming row has its own tag or longtag i perform an xml bulk load using isqlxmlbulkload to load all the new records at giant delete statement sometimes times taking 30 seconds or not sure records come in off the socket they must either be inserted or they must replace existing is the way doing it the best way to do the ratio of new rows to replacement rows is going to be very heavily slanted toward new in data i have seen coming from there will typically be new rows for each both the inserts and the deletes must be handled as a single if either the insert or the delete they must both be rolled leaving the table in the same state it was in before the inserts deletes regarding null i need to first briefly describe the system a little this is a database for a trading mytable is a trades table containing two kind of and day trades are simply trades if you were an options trader and you did a that trade would be a day trade in this opening positions are basically a summary of your portfolio up until both opening positions and day trades are stored in the same day trades have tags longtags or numeric and opening positions do there can be duplicate rows for opening positions that is fine but there cannot be duplicate rows for day if a day trade comes in with the same tag as some record already in the then the data in the table is replaced with the new there are 4 possibilities for the values in tag tag is longtag is this is a day trade with a numeric tag is zero and longtag has a character this is a day trade with an alphanumeric tag is zero and longtag is this is an opening tag is and longtag has a character this is prevented from every happening by our server but if it were to happen the longtag would be ignored and it would be treated the same as case this does not efficient delete for many

should know when each customer arrived in the when they arrive at the server you should add one to the number of customers served as well as accumulate the amount of time he at the end of the simulation you simply divide the accumulated time by the number of customers and you have a mean wait time for the core problem is in accounting for different events and updating statistics based on those simulation should initialize all of the structures of your simulation into a reasonable the queue of customers to no one in any count of served customers to any accumulated wait times to the current system time to all the system has been initailized you create an event that a cusotmer this will normally be determined by some given generating system events will need to update the statistics of the you have a choice at this point of generating all of the arrival the service time of each customer is also something that you will generate from a given must then handle each event and update the statistics for example when the first customer arrives the queue has been empty from the time the simulation started to the current the average number of customers in the queue is likely a parameter of you should accumulate the 0 elapsed seconds into an once the customer arrives at the empty queue you should generate the service either the next customer will arrive before or after the given job if the next cusomter arrives before the previous one has been serviced then you add him into the queue the fact no one has been depending on what event occurs next you must accumulate the statistics that occur in that time the idle time of the server is also a parameter of interest in such make things more clear consider the fact there are 18 people in line and the server has completed a job for the first the interval of between the arrival of the 18th customer and the time the first persons job is complete is a weighted average to be added to an there have been 18 people in line for 4 seconds for server has not been idle so you should take an entry off the queue and start processing the next the job will take some amount of time usually defined from some if the next customer arrives before the current job is finished the fact 17 people were in line would be added to your weighted at the fundamental level you are accumulating statistics between relevant events in your wait that helps it seems a bit

solution suggested by soulmerge is the and therefore best one you just need to nest the calls to i just want to add that the like will change nothing to the status if the searched string is not therefore you can safely apply it to all and since a condition where you search a string lost in the middle of another string cannot make any use of whatever index you useless as a filtering only filtering condition is the one on brings one point that justifies why solution is iterating on all the changes is a bad suppose that the filter on is moderately odds are that oracle will choose to scan the do you really want to scan the table each time when you can do all the changes in a single	
solution to this problem achieves a couple of but unfortunately there are plenty of other issues that it you are worried that the output array might not even have a valid terminated c string in then addressed that issue by inserting a by brute additionally chosen the optimal the last byte of the array be used for anything else if the array is supposed to hold a terminated done nothing to stop the called function trampling over memory beyond the array allocated for the number one thing be worried memory trampling buffer rocket but it does demand discipline and usually the basic idea involved is to never simply pass the address of some memory to be but instead to always accompany that address with the length of the memory block of course the called code must respect the limitation thus imposed on it looks like you know about the basic idea since you mention which is the classic example of this

solution you propose seems like a good as long as you mind people being able to view the part of the site if they are logged ie as long as the http part of the site does not contain any sensitive and the only difference between logged in and users is something harmless in the reason it is not used very often may be one scenario may just not be very usually if you care enough to make part of your site restrict the login session just to that secure or make the entire site always use https solutions exist which are secure and which are capable of more than for example logging in someone at an https login form and maintaining that session while transferring them back to an also think flickr or their sign in page is always but once the started you migrate back to http while maintaining the session since i wrote this back in 2009 the practice of having a secure connection for the login screen but dropping back to http once logged in seems to have possibly because the overhead of using https is not seen as so much of a big now more than sites are increasingly using https as the whenever they accept user

some limited a hash map could but you need to think how going to purge cached images from memory when the cache gets you define that probably some maximum amount of memory that you want to devote to how going to deal with how going to deal with the case where client a requests an and then client b requests the same image while it is still being loaded into the cache for client very simple solution to could be to always store softreferences to the image data and let the jvm take care of deciding when to purge them in mind it could arbitrarily purge them at times beyond your you need to develop some kind of policy image accessed longest image image that will take longest to decode if we have to load it again only you know your data and so you have to find the right will generally help you you may decide to use explicit locks and other concurrency utilities in fancier a fairly elegant solution proposed by goetz et al is to hijack the future in your you store a future to the cached object to your if a requester finds that a future has already been added to the then it can call and wait for the other thread to finish caching the could achieve a similar effect with an explicit lock and but future takes some of the work out for i agree with the poster who said you probably want to store the images in their original coded but from your code assuming that was probably what you were intending all

special would you would write at some place in the middle of the allocated memory bytes apart from the 99 bytes before the end of the allocated you would free that allocated the compiler will handle it exactly as we would the memory allocated by that is completely unrelated to null terminated you could stick everything you want into that some chunk of you could even create some arbitrary object into that memory bug is somewhere for some common error is this where the constructor is called but the destructor is called a p p new delete return int a a what happens is that the default constructor is called and the created object is copied zero or more but the destructor is run for each copy you will call the destructor on the pointer more than leading to such strange the correct way to fix is to use a smart like as an you can also do it by writing proper copy constructors that copy the object over and allocate memory in the copy so that the copy and the respective original object keep distinct

support using cross datacontext objects directly is really not worth scenario that you have is a result of coupling between the you are creating an internal dependency on it using the same datacontext which is revealed on the registerowner code trying using the received entity what happens if the calling code updates something on the person should the code really be saving those type of coupling at the repository level might be ok inside the same bounded if these are supposed to be pieces of independent the car repository would focus on saving only the information it is meant to which is a subset of owner info that identifies the user in the car this is what allows you to switch pieces along the of this makes more sense in more complex scenario where you want to have higher degrees of that on the sample posted you are not really needing to update anything on so you could effectively go with a version that only sets the person id on the car owner instead of assigning it the full person the more coupled you can use answer give them the same datacontext

table is the central type in and can be treated as either an associative array table or or as an ordinary the keys can be values of any lua type except and the elements of a table can hold any value except member access is made more efficient than hash key access behind the but the details usually that actually makes handling sparse arrays handy since storage only need be allocated for those cells that contain a value at does lead to a universal array idiom that feels a little strange to a c 3 an array stored in the variable with three elements that have the same values as their because the elements are stored at sequential indices beginning with the length of by or is a table with keys can be done like return 17 will have entries named and an anonymous of looking up that last element without iterating the table might be tricky unless a copy of that very function is stored in some other place that curly braces appear is really the same semantic but it is concealed a new user of behind some syntactic it is common to write functions that take a single argument that should be a in that calling the function does not require use of this results in code that seems to contain a mix of and both apparently used as a function call equivalent to is also less hard on the calling a function with a literal value also works for string

takes less time to produce code than i say i mean with comments that communicate your intention clearly at every typing comments takes some and your coworkers should all be smart enough to figure out what you intended just by reading your descriptive function and variable names and spelunking their way through all your executable but it takes more of their time to do it than if you had just explained your and clear documentation is especially helpful when the logic of the code turns out to be not that code would ever be firmly believe that if you time it from when you start a project to when you ship a writing code takes less for one having to explain clearly what doing forces you to think it through and if you write a concise explanation of what your code is accomplishing then probably not designed and for another purely selfish and code is far easier to dump onto someone else to maintain thus freeing the original author to go create the next big i rarely if ever have to stop what doing to explain how my code was meant to work because blatantly obvious to anyone who can read english if they read and one more reason my memory just that i recall what i had for breakfast much less what i was thinking when i wrote code a month or a year perhaps your memory is far better than but because i document my intentions i can quickly pick up wherever i left off and make changes without having to first figure out what i was thinking when i wrote why i document well not because i feel some noble calling to produce pretty code fit for and not because a but simply because it lets me ship quality software in less

team is evaluating dbdeploy for managing database as i understand using migrations requires a bit of process namely that a migration is written for every and that to reach it would have to be promoted from local to development to test to our production dba team makes schema changes directly to the production if we write a new migration to make the change against our current development version of the that migration will never be tested against a schema that already contains the change until the migration is being deployed to this concerns other option is to make the change directly to the baseline then rebuild the database in all environments this approach concerns because the new schema could cause one or more migrations to are people currently handling this do i merge schema changes made to a production database into my

test collision detections between 2 oriented bounding use separating axis theorem in fact sat can be used for collision detection between any 2 convex this technique is not overly complex to understand and has a reasonable theorem can easily be extended to algorithm tries to determine is it is possible to fit a plane between two if such a plane then the object are and cannot determine if the objects are it is simply a matter of projecting the objects onto the of the and comparing the intervals and see if they there is obviously an infinite number of planes that can fit between two separated but it has been proved you only have to test a handful of can be shown that for the separation planes to be tested are the planes with normal equal to the axes of both so for 2 you only need to test 4 separation planes in out of the 4 once you found a separation plane that separates the then you know the box cannot and you return a no collision the 4 planes cannot separate the then the box must be and there you have a

that we have lambdas and type inference and some other an idiom that is common in other languages which now makes a lot of sense in your example was about opening a doing something to and then closing you can make a helper method which opens a and also takes care of making sure to close dispose clean but calls out to a lambda you provide for the this will help you get the complicated stuff right in one and then use it over and an static void file openfile openfile making this up point is you are acquiring a resource that needs to be cleaned up or or callers of this method have to worry about how to open the file or close dispose of they can do something like f text	
that where squashing the is used to clean up when you either catch the or rethrow in either case leaving final exception response to calling since exceptions in cocoa are only supposed to be used for programming errors and thus occur this is an entirely reasonably thing to also worth pointing out one case where you need to use which is when you set up your own autorelease when the autorelease pool is any inner ones that been cleaned up yet will also if you do try to clean it up you need to promote the exception itself out of your autorelease	
that while flexibility is a worthy added flexibility with ioc and di to some extent are requirements for also increases the only point of flexibility is to make changes downstream cheaper or each point increases and thus contributes to making changes elsewhere more is actually where you need a big design up front to identify what areas are most likely to change need extensive unit and plan for flexibility refactor to eliminate flexibility where changes are not saying that you can guess where flexibility will be needed with any kind of be but likely that get something where you later find you need it can be factored out in where you need it can be factored in when adding areas which may or may not change depends on your business problem and it here are some recurring always consider where you integrate systems to be highly code provides a back end user interface will need to support change in the plan for changes in functionality go overboard and plan for different ui technologies as supporting both a smart client and a web application usage patterns will differ too the other coding to different platforms is a time at least in ask around and plans may exist to replace technologies within lifespan of your to data content and formats are a while data most seen handle such and thus you get classes used only you can make the judgement of what might or should not

the answer is probably a combination of 1 and can take advantage of a lot of the tools and features that the framework provides for you by writing a or provider if the default options quite go as far as done just that on a number of client sites for example one of our clients has most of their users stored as commerce server and use the commerce server profile so we wrote a membership and profile provider to talk to those datastores a fairly simple people are probably going for 3 because of the need to authenticate over raw tcp this introduces a layer beyond that of the standard membership of what ms produce is or but there will always be edge cases where you want to do something quite that mean you end up rolling your i guess to have something beyond or that was simple for your average developer to they took the sensible option of just build this for the you take a look at the numerous ways you can authenticate against a wcf see what i mean these designed to handle different transport and are therefore much more the default roles and profile providers are fairly limited no so you need to check for each possible or explicitly assign each role to the all stored in one field as comma seperated values not easy to find all users got a value	
the answer to your question depends on how your data member is distinguish two types of data members in a use the common term to refer to data are the logical state or of the attributes are rarely declared as have coined the protologism it denote members that are simply that are somewhat divorced from the state of the have no contextual relevance to the user of the exist in the class only to contribute to the efficient operation of the are usually declared in the class as mutable and are or example say your object is a linked you have a pointer to the first item in the would consider this pointer a contribute because does not represent the data in the if the list is sorted and is set to the new first item in the user of the list object could care less how the is only that the list data has modified or not and that the the list is sorted or not to the if you had a booean data member to quickly the list is in a sorted that too would be a it is the list structure itself which imbues the sorted variable member is used simply to efficiently remember the having to scan the another if you have a const method that searches the you know that typically the search will return recently previously searched for would keep a pointer in your class to such a item so your first check if the last found item matches the search key before entire list the method does indeed need to search the list and the pointer would be pointer i would consider to be a contribute because only there to help speed up the even though updates the pointer the method is because none of the data in the container are data members that are attributes are usually not declared data members that contribute to the functioning of an object will usually be

the short design patterns will often increase the complexity of the they add extra abstractions in places they might not be strictly in the long term they reduce complexity because future enhancements and changes fit into the patterns in a simple without the these changes would be much more intrusive and complexity would likely be much for example a decorator the first time you use it will add complexity because now you have to define an interface for the object and create another class to add the this could likely be done with a simple property and be done when you get to 5 or 20 the complexity with a decorator is much less than with

the single data once you start encountering performance problems there are many solutions like you can partition your tables by website id also known as horizontal partitioning or you can also use this all depends upon the the ratio of reads vs for start keep things simple and use one table with proper you can also determine if you need transactions or you can also take advantage of various different mysql storage engines like myisam or ndb memory to boost up the also caching plays a very good role in offloading the load from the the data that is mostly read only and can be computed easily is usually put in the cache and the cache serves the request instead of going to the database and only the necessary queries go to the

the stack is where local variables get every time you call a subroutine the program counter to the next machine and any important and sometimes the parameters get pushed on the then any local variables inside the subroutine are pushed onto the stack used from when the subroutine that stuff all gets popped back off the the pc and register data gets and put back where it was as it is so your program can go on its merry heap is the area of memory dynamic memory allocations are made out of or it is a special data structure that can keep track of blocks of memory of varying sizes and their allocation systems ram was laid out such that the stack pointer started out at the bottom of the heap pointer started out at the and they grew towards each if they you are out of that work with modern oses every thread has to have its own and those can get created

the strings will not use twice the since strings are immutable objects in you will just store another reference 4 or 8 per entry in the dict new mywidget will always be reusing the string object from the so just go on with the dict and store the path as property inside the you need to enumerate the widgets in sorted use the it will be slower than the dictionary log average the path will need you to remove it from the dictionary and add it with the changed but this is an average constant time so it should be pretty just to mention even if you would have to spend one mb of additional memory for getting more performance or using a data i think that would be a great problem considering the amount of memory other applicatins are using these days	
the struct will hold the data while a class will behave more like a that alone makes an important since passing the struct as a parameter to a method will pass its values them on the while the class will pass the reference to the if the struct is you will be copying a lot of values on each method when it is really small copying the values and using them directly will be probably faster than copying the pointer and having to grab them from another you assign it to null you can use and you have to initialize it right

there a way to use the method to compile the expression associated with an currently i have an iqueryable with a very large expression tree behind the iqueryable was built up using several methods which each supply for two methods may return iqueryables which are then joined in a for this reason i explicitly define the entire expression within the method was hoping to pass the expression in to the compile method as however this expression in the form required by the compile if i try and get around this by putting the query directly into the compile var foo var bar i make the call form within a i get an error saying that is not mapped as a stored procedure or again i just copy the contents of the getusers method to where i make the compile call since it in turn makes use of other there some way to pass the expression on the iqueryable returned from into the compile tried to force my will on the system with the following var phony wishful var foo ends up have the option to see the results in as instead of offering to expand the results and run the query i only see the message could destabilize the just need to find a way for the sql string to only be generated once and used as a paramaterized command on subsequent i can do this manually using the getcommand method on the data but then i have to explicitly set all the parameters and do the object mapping which is a few hundred lines of code given the complexity of this particular rusk provided the most useful so i awarded him the win on this some extra tweaking was required and there were a couple of other issues i encountered along the way so i thought on the the could destabalize the error was not due to the compilation of the it was actually because of some casting deep in the expression in some places i needed to call the method to formally cast even when they were of the correct without going into too much detail this was basically required when several expression were combined into a single tree and each branch could return a different which were each the sub type of a common solving the destabalizing i returned to the compilation expand solution was almost it looked for method call expressions in the tree and tried to resolve them to the underlying expression that method would usually my references to expressions were not provided by method but instead so i needed to modify the expression visitor that performs the expansion to include these override expression return new return method may not be appropriate in all but it should help anyone who finds themselves in the same linq to sql queries from a	
there an easy way to serialize data in to xml or and then deserialize the data in working with some remote winnt machines that run my server app is written entirely in so i want an easy way to share simple data value pairs and maybe some representation of a sql result i figure the best way is going to be to write the data to xml in some predefined format on the transfer the xml file to my and have a wrapper read the xml into a usable client and server are communicating over a tcp and what i really want is to serialize the data in memory on the transfer the binary data over the socket to a memory stream that i can deserialize into a object file but i think anything like that feel free to enlighten know i can create a struct in the app and define it in and transfer data that but in my that feels like limiting what can be have to set predefined sizes for in then deserialize in

there are a handful of ways to do what but a good number of them are not going to be implementation you could use locks or but they will really only work on threaded servers and probably not at all in a more or less means the locking implementation will be up to two file on your file property in your model both you have to manually set the lock object on update and check against it on try something obj if raise simultaneousupdateerror this return in models locked def def overriding save because you want to use generic probably not the best idea to rework model code to accomodate view but i like to give this creates a different critical is indeed a clumsy implementation that have to clean you may not be comfortable with the fact that a different critical region has been but i see how do much better if your using the database as an implementation without making the implementation much more option would be to make the locks entirely separate then you could update them after the method is but i feel like coding that if you really want to use a locking that would also solve the if this might be the thing for something def return def if not raise if f def raise class locked def maybe some way to mix and match these suggestions to your

theres not a whole lot of difference there is very little one can do that the other but the configs tend to differ most obvious difference is that oracle uses sequences and sql server uses there are pros and cons to some prefer one over the my experience doing top n queries in sql server seems a little easier than of the box oracle uses mvcc data is to reads by other database maintains a consistent sql server i only discovered recently has this too but not the default option and is called something quite transaction isolation level or and are reasonably different in syntax in some areas but the concepts are mostly the i found sql server management studio to be ok but horrendous in some like its data just work with auto increment primary this was a known bug going back years on sql server i know if fixed it in 2008 or with developer ship as part of a separate commercial imports and exports were a has an annoying limit on limited to 4k in much longer in sql server found the sql server security model just tcp was disabled by default authentication and then you had to setup a logon and a i never quite got it just seemed to be to be overly complicated whereas in oracle its user blah identified by connect to granting some other like resource is pretty never quite figured out the from the managemen recover would fail saying someone was connected to the database but that someone was me attempting to run the before anyone has a go at me for the i realize fully well that many of them stem from my lack of sql server experience but honestly theres still a level of consistency the and portability of concepts that is

thing you know about the inner prism is that it will have the same ratios as the outer in other words given the height of the inner prism you can calculate the inner base length and from there the know the base will have 1 unit so that leaves calculating the distance from the pinnacle of the inner prism to the pinnacle of the outer distance is the hypontenuse of a right angled the angles in the triangle are known since they are function of the base length and one side of the triangle is of length being the perpendicular from the inner edge at the inner pinnacle to the outer final side of the triangle is where that perpendicular intersects the outer edge up to the outer is enough info to use standard trig to caclulate the hypotenuse this length plus 1 thickness the subtracted from the original height gives you the inner the ratio between the inner and outer heights can be applied to the base a probably cleverer ways to do this but this would be my common bloke

think come up with the solution to match the behaviour of in your subscribe to the keyboard so you know when the keyboard will show and and the system will tell you the size of the but forget to unregister in your the methods similar to the below so that you adjust the size of your tableview to match the visible area once the keyboard here tracking the state of the keyboard separately so i can choose when to set the tableview back to full height since you get these notifications on every field forget to implement and choose somewhere appropriate to fix your tableview cgrect keyboardheight if keyboardisshowing cgrect frame the scrolling we work out a few sizes then we see where we are in the visible and set the rect we want to scroll to to be either the half view above or below the middle of the text field based on where it is in the in this we have an array of uitextfields and an enum that keeps track of so multiplying the rowheight by the row number gives us the actual offset of the frame within this outer cgrect frame cgfloat rowheight if rowheight else if rowheight else if rowheight else if rowheight cgfloat viewheight cgfloat halfheight viewheight cgfloat midpoint if seems to work quite

think find yourself backed into an uncomfortable corner if you try to use any metric to definitively predict or control the outcome of your your project will ask the questions the best you can do is a that is based on your current knowledge of the project at this point in time and this just comes from experience and literally the your estimates will likely be off by several orders of they only become more accurate as your team understands the problem domain and they estimate no more than weeks barry boehm steve illustrated this effect with the of further you are from implementation of a system or feature the greater the innacuracy of your estimates as you get and understand the problem domain estimates begin to take on greater accuracy this is in software projects where there is a lot of or almost every we want to leave concrete estimation until the last responsible moment no more than weeks can also expect one thing with absolute specifications will change over how you plan to adapt and manage that change will measure your the best judgement that can be made to scope your work would be to assemble the team who will work on the project and the to collaboratively work out the big brush strokes the major features of the write these as user stories that the team estimates using relative weight points mike book on agile estimating and and devise a release plan that will give the customer a forecast on what to expect they can then decide if the investment will generate the return they are looking assuming that be releasing so that your customer is always in possession of some functional increment of the final product vital for their continued valuation of the r

think got more problems than just the dot not matching but let me start with a formatting you can use just about any punctuation character as the regex not just the slash if you use another you have to escape slashes within the i understand is popular among that would make your pattern the reason that regex work as you intended is because the dot loses its special meaning when it appears inside a character class square just matches a dot or a what you were looking for was but i would have recommended matching the as well as the because the word can refer to the or any given web page may contain any of those or a mixture of two or more a mix of and is very but with mode known as or dotall you need to worry about another problem with the original regex still present in this the is that if more than one sequence in the the first time your regex is applied it will match all of from the first to the last the simplest way to fix that is to make the ungreedy or by appending a question i know what to make of the before the opening quote of your pattern i do but that looks like a syntax error to if someone could educate me in this appreciate

think i know why this fails to work as because the initial user list is a linq it is each time it is iterated when used in and again when doing the and new user objects are this would lead to different references and so no using fixes this because it iterates the linq query once only and so the references are been able to reproduce the problem you have and having investigated the this seems like a very plausible i proved it just ran the test but outputting the collection before the call to in that and after each time the hash code for the object was output and they do indeed have different values each time indicating new as i is the output for each of the here is the modified code to show the int string user iuser public int public string public override string return id public static locallist new new new var matches from u in join lu in on equals select return public static void foreach user in static void xdocument doc new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new users new id name a objects have not been var matches var excludes excludes should contain 6 users but here it contains 8	
think i should clarify how the compilation model first of you can write everything in a single file and inherit from whatever class you want to ultimately inherits from by specifying attribute you might want to omit and without a if you do you can still access the properties from the file that uses this the thing you use the class in the codebehind file of page it has by specifying the if you are using the website project model of visual you can access it from the file note that this would not work in web application project model as every file will be compiled ahead of the time to the in that even attribute help any strictly none of the attributes are you can always use the properties defined anywhere in or file included in a page in the file always to address the update to the from your source it seems you are using the website model note that i mentioned you cannot use the i agree this statement might have been a little what i wanted to note is that without a will choose a name for your user control class but that name is not while you use the generated not recommended at you should treat it pretty much like an anonymous type where you can use an instance but cannot mention a in your you are basically referencing an instance is constructed on the not the which is what you are saying is whatever you declare in in a web application will be visible to and what i was talking about is properties that you declare in in a those will not be visible to since compiled will generate the class defined by the attribute in the you should use there is one thing i forgot to in this you should somehow reference the in the either with a directive reference directive or with a directive register this will ensure that the build engine puts the generated class in the same assembly as

think in your uiimage should handle this app and give good the issue looks to be that you are forcing the whole screen to redraw in response to every the rect that is passed in specifies the that you need to any other drawing is just wasting the rect you pass to your is the rect you specifically want to calculate a rect around the touch and invaliate uikit will union mutiple dirty rects and send a single would suggest you perform the following the dirty rect passed to your the and if it is less than the full screen write code to make sure you only repaint images within the dirty the touches event to make sure you only invalidate the areas that need redrawing and then revisit this get the performance you use quartz to draw the black and white rects rather than using images incase it is some uiimage weirdness i doubt this is the you need to display bitmaps and 1 2 get the performance you you will have to resort to lower level there are lots of examples around including on

think structures are great if you need copy the object or do not want it to be modified by the passed since passed functions can not modify the originally passed structure instead got a new copy of this can be a life they passed as byref and can save you trouble of deep copy craziness in or implementing pain of an iclonesomething the general idea is defining a custom data structure in a more semantic moving to a if you are moving into a class where be part of a generally this is good practice since your structure is of the time related with one of you classes not related with a you are converting it to a class then you need to consider it defining a data and it since gonna be copied all over the you want to get affected by modifications done by the	
think that checking in commented out code should be valid just because the new change passed tests it may be more helpful to see what was there before and see if the new change is really an i have to go back several versions to see an earlier change that now leads to a performance hit then that would be very the commented out code is a good put dates as to when the code was commented someone that is working near there can just delete the commented out code as it has been proven not to be would also be good to know who commented out that code so that if some rationale is needed then they can be prefer to write new ensure the unit tests check it then allow others to use it and see how it	
think that code needs to first and readable and optimisations that are should not be at the expense of optimisation is often a or not you should optimise your code depends on your application if you are working on an embedded processor with only 8mb of then optimisation is probably something that every team member needs to keep in when writing code optimising for space vs optimisation is not useful unless your system has been clearly and this is because most programmers do not make good optimisation decisions unless they can factor in the influence of the overall including processor architectural factors such as cache hardware	
think that everything suggested is there are a couple ways you can go about validator an could be done addressvalidator new valid address address way you recognize that the addressvalidator is coupled to the you could do this using the iscomplete in is a good oop heuristic to say that all objects should construct with valid but it just always oop maximizes the information you can take advantage force as many errors to occur at compile rather than run user interfaces will thwart this at all you kind of have to violate this think the j2ee convention is to construct objects without parameters and call a hundred for address int two you want to be technical about valid then you really have two different the state returned by your ui and the state needed by your why not make the difference for if my ui has 12 fields i could have a object that has 12 string in control of regardless of what the user i can make sure the ui returns 12 you can then create an instance of and call on uiaddress address modeladdress all going to depend on your intended but there really is a lot of flexibility for the way is to put in the

think that test driven programming is the before actually implementing the you first create a unit test it a then gradually implement the functionality and make sure the contract is still valid as you usually i start with plain stubs and then gradually fill out the rest replacing the stabs with real keep improving and making the test at the end you end up with a robust implementation of said module plus got a fantastic test bed coded implementation of the later if someone modifies the first you see if it can still fit the test if it the contract is broken reject the the contract is fix the unit and so boring cycle of software development	
think that the best approach is to go to the official java and skim it and just stop at everything that looks unfamiliar and read more most tutorials are aimed at people who never developed but imho the sun one is fairly useful even for people who do understand would also recommend reading a tutorial or a difference for short summary of differences with code think that eclipse is a good ide and should be straightforward to a word of if you decide to use a book on make sure that it is updated to java 5 and in the early days java missed support for generics and that made everything incredibly special attention to the tutorial chapters about the collections framework and the java threading wait with the other apis guis with also be aware that the java library is somewhat as you you may want to take a look at the apache commons project for many things that the main library is

think that there are some things to do before you tackle the technical question what technology do i create the true knowledge and understanding of the system is what lies beyond the actual interface relationships and module it is the understanding of the whole system and how the individual parts in it contribute to the would go in the following try to the system this means to first understand the structure of the modules and create some representation of from the top this you will probably find additional metadata on the modules that does not exist in your current take the time to add it will be most useful when you later create the automatic because it will reflect the knowledge on the system write a simple program that will generate a set of files from the that will help you browse and navigate the information more easily as a starting point for further i would not go into a fully fledged javadoc format in the start small and evolve your in as needs this process you would also discover where refactoring would make use the output of your htmls to research structure of several modules and reach understanding of internal of are there naming repeated anything that you can deduce and is not obviously documented already in the would create some local uml but not of a size that will get out of hand perhaps several umls per mark dependencies to external modules in a distinct generation of automated umls will not be as it is the of meaningful interfaces in each diagram that will make the most enlightening umls in the think the final result of a set of htmls and umls will be a good final

think that you can use exceptions for flow there a flipside of this creating exceptions is a costly because they have to create a stack so if you want to use exceptions more often than for just signalling an exceptional situation you have to make sure that building the stack traces negatively influence your best way to cut down the cost of creating exceptions is to override the method like throwable return an exception will have no stacktraces filled

think that you need to step back and think about what a or associative really all it is is a way to store a value for a given and get that value back quickly and you may also want to be able to iterate over the keys to retrieve every key value or delete keys and their associated think about a data structure you use all the time in shell and even just in the shell without writing a that has these the all you need to have an associative array in shell programming is a temp is your associative array you feel like using and you can always write some little these ones are modelled off of though they just output the value rather than setting arbitrary variables like 3 exit mkdir echo 2 exit cat own this approach is actually quite a bit faster than the linear search using sed suggested by the as well as more robust allows keys and values to contain qnd the fact that it uses the filesystem does not make it these files are actually never guaranteed to be written to the disk unless you call for temporary files like this with a short not unlikely that many of them will never be written to did a few benchmarks of modification of and my using the following driver fix broken stack overflow syntax i 0 i 1 for j 0 j 1 put get time irfan 10 real user sys time brian 10 real user sys time jerry 10 real user sys time irfan 100 real user sys time brian 100 real user sys time jerry 100 real user sys time irfan 10 real user sys time brian 10 real user sys time jerry 10 real user sys time irfan 1000 real user sys time brian 1000 real user sys time jerry 1000 real user sys

think the problem is the app get anywhere near pegging my but the frame rate still appear would look at two how calculating your position and how often firing the event to do 100 frames per choose 30fps instead other refresh on your or you should attempt to do your updates in sync with your like a video game 30 alone probably solve the you also assume that the time between events is elapsed you are firing a timer to do that update every that mean actually getting done in a consistent amount of garbage os whatever can affect the amount of time it actually measure the elapsed time since the last update was actually and do your calculation based on that	
think the reason you are seeing this in leaks is because is using the autorelease pool being discarded until the next i think the sample is too simple to accurately show going could be way off base but i would try wrapping your code in an autorelease pool to see what nsautoreleasepool nsmutablestring test this should drain the autorelease

think the trick is the following going to do it in base because but the principle should you are multiplying mod 1234 12 100 5432 54 100 12 54 10000 34 54 100 12 32 100 34 54 10000 648 54 100 1836 32 100 384 32 x 10000 x the first and last terms become the second and third terms are where the come note 18 100 100 18 10000 3600 3618 is essentially a circular giving the results of 648 3618 8403 and also note that in all the multiplied numbers are a 100 and b so this is calculable if you only could multiple 2 digit numbers and add going to work out with a and both are 32 suppose you want to multiply them mod but you only have a 16 bit multiplier 32 the algorithm would be something like a b accumulator for for do the temp add the bits to the shifting over the right x for bits bits accumulator do modulus if it if accumulator so the accumulator part of that probably i think in principle right someone feel free to edit this to make it this is pretty as which is what the prng x x

think there is a best if you have the time to code up menus and high score tables in opengl the you have a lot more flexibility you could for example have a 3d animation going on in the you code high score using standard uikit views and switch out the opengl view while they are shown then this has the advantage that very quick to code if you took the time to learn to use interface but it is inherently even though you can still use custom button graphics and fonts to make it look less like a business still going to look less polished compared to other games in the app you want to do is to layer a transparent uiview over the top of you opengl view this will be very personally use interface builder generated views to get stuff like menus in while building the rest of the the intention is to replace that with opengl animated code in the end really down to how much time you have

think there is anything wrong with using exceptions for exceptions are somewhat similar to continuations and in statically typed exceptions are more powerful than if you need continuations but your language have you can use exceptions to implement if you need continuations and your language have you chose the wrong language and you should rather be using a different but sometimes you have a web programming is prime just no way to get around is a project to allow writing web applications in and let the framework take care of figuring out which bits need to run one consequence of this is that volta needs to be able to compile cil to so that you can run code on the there is a has javascript volta implements continuations in javascript using javascript then implements threads using those that volta applications that use threads can be compiled to run in an unmodified no silverlight

think this is a programming question so i am i have tracked it down to the dll provided by the when the app it looks like a problem with the way the dll is the call stack shows a memory free operation in the then a operation in the then a operation in and a subsequent heap then that tears down the whole still understand why it works in a windows forms app and in iis but not work in iis this has become more of a platform question than a it is probably the responsibility to fix it rather than mine to work around within two days of filing the tech support ticket with the they provided an updated set of the integration dlls that use a com object that you register with and it works in iis7 if you register it in the wow64 yea for first data technical	
think this is completely solvable in using only you know the calling convention used by the target for there is a risk that you end up the or at least having to what if the compiler decided to build the registered function using arguments passed in perhaps due to some optimization setting what if it was built with a different also no way in general to express in c that you want to call a function with a given set of and that the values for the arguments need to be unpacked from a buffer of random could do something horrible like void const void signature case int x void case quite clear that this live on the same continent as you could of course this for some reasonable set of return types and argument still be a bit out in the cold for casting function pointers but that might be still always run the risk of someone handing you a signature that you have code	
think this is precisely what you are asking the bash shell script executes a command with a upon expiration sigterm is sent to the if the is then the subsequent sigkill terminates based on the bash documentation hello please find attached a to if you find it feel free to the very same logic as in the original little more transparent implementation to my dmitry v golovashkin interval between checks if the process is still delay between posting the sigterm signal and destroying the process by cat execute a command with a upon expiration sigterm is sent to the if signal is then the subsequent sigkill terminates number of seconds to wait for command default interval between checks if the process is still positive default delay between posting the sigterm signal and destroying process by default of bash does not support floating point arithmetic all values must be getopts case exit 1 should be at least 1 command to however it may be greater than 1 if the command itself has 0 interval exit kill pid exit code indicates if a signal may be sent to while sleep kill exit be post sigterm the below will be executed if any preceeding command kill sigterm kill exit sleep kill sigkill

think we recently had a similar afair solution was to give a self animal self get return could then be casted to correct what happens is that your original object has a reference to nhibernate proxy object lazily which acts as animal for all methods exposed via animal class passes all calls to the loaded however it cannot be casted as any of your other animals because it is none of it only emulates the animal however the class that is encapsulated by animalproxy can be casted as subclassed animal because it is a real instance of correct you only need to get to

think what you are doing should work fine just return the number of occurrences as the exit code from the mention that will only allow numbers below i highly doubt if this is the but it would be simple enough for you to write a test program to find out for like this is really just a simplified version of you might want to have a look at that algorithm as well for some ideas on how you could further parallelize the program and maybe get some extra credit for the difference between and if you just want to wait for any of your child processes to you would use if you want to wait only for a specific child process or if you wanted to just check if a child process has exited without you would use	
think what you are trying to say is that your string always end up in the same iteration of your if that is so there are basically two huge there is no way to prove that you will not get any misses here but it will lower the chance you know the max length of the string that you are looking for you can make two the first holds the current part that you just got and the other holds the the reason you need to know the length of the string is because the size of your buffers needs to be atleast the size of the second solution is by far the better one but it does rely on the knowledge of the max length of	
think you and even the interpreter be able to therefore run you be worried about people seeing your if there are security you should fix them	
think you are going to have to do quite a bit of work for you would have to create an implementation of icustomtypedescriptor which would base its implementation on whatever typedescriptor you would normally get for that in the implementations of the methods which expose the descriptors of the members you want to lock you would provide subclasses which derive from those descriptors and override the appropriate methods to wrap a lock for a you would implement getproperties to return your specific subclasses of these subclasses would override the getvalue and setvalue methods and use a lock when accessing those should be mentioned that locking like this in the ui thread is probably a bad since you want to arbitrarily block operations on that it might be better to just create a clone of the object and then have a method which updates the store of objects when you are

think you can say that an appropriate number is no or good rule of thumb for constructors is to pass an object its not its those parameters you pass in are ones that are essential for the existence of the and without which most operations of the object may not be you genuinely have a class with a very complicated natural hence requiring many parameters then consider the design of your example of a bad constructor int int the nightwatchman is being constructed with some default values that will almost certainly change in a short it seems funny that the object is told about their values one and then has them in a different way their in example of a better constructor boolean gate the watchman is watching is required information for one to in the class i would mark it chosen to pass the variable into the because here it was important that at all times the object knew whether to shoot identity is being used as could have a class called and the parameter is interpreted as part of the objects	
think you do it without using some external has some methods to resolve names via but only usable for resolving names into ip addresses and not for generic dns you need some external library like	
think you really ought to be using the valueprovider on the controller rather than referencing the parameters in the request using the value provider will make it much easier to unit test since you have to mock up the just provide a valueprovider implementation to the var provider new var controller new var result public actionresult int carpaymenttype need to add error you can also iterate through the keys on the valueprovider just like you would on

think you will find a component that will change the priority numbering for instead you should invoke a routine that would update the priority numbers accordingly after changing the suggest that you look at richfaces or richfaces got some very neat functionality for implementing the sort of thing you are talking recommend that you have a look at the demo and try out the support the richfaces component set also got an ordering list rich but it seem to allow for changing the ordering by entering a rather it is done using up and down

think your data model might be a little is the prices table being populated just for the i might review my but if i had to use this i would do something like product prices in a specified region use this select in a sproc that accepts region as a if i did it it will return the region if there is and the product if there price from where or is null and product not in product from prices where region product prices in a specified use this select in a sproc that accepts store as a you will also need to pass in region or figure it out from the if i did it it will return the store if there is then he region then the product price from where or is null and region and product not in product from prices where store or is null and region is null and product not in product from prices where region get prices from multiple regions or just execute one of the above sprocs multiple times a loop or	
think your design may be why not use one single table with a region and a customer i were i would consider refactoring to one single and if necessary reverse compatibility for i would use views to provide the same info as in the previous to answer op comments to this post table with 10 000 000 000 rows in it will do just provided you use proper database servers are built to cope with this kind of is definitely not a valid reason to split one such table into thousands of smaller ones

think your regex has anything to do with are you at least getting all the right lines in your new even if they are think you need to go through the normal debugging you show us a complete but minimal program that demonstrates the the problem might be somewhere is in does it have all of the line when you print it to if work backward until you find the point where the text goes print its value before and after the suspect operations and work backward until you find the you sure all of that text is on one or there any extra weird characters in the what does have in it on the next line happens if you print everything to the new file match all does all the text end up in the new the lines always truncated at the same	
think your understanding of the layers involved is a little bit c uses which you use or is effectively equivalent to that buffered output on file descriptor when you run file descriptor is attached to the when you run file descriptor is attached to your program even starts so writing to which you change scribbles to file descriptor will print to the file and not the outside of your program cares about your buffered or what you do with your own

this area seems to be really fragmented and no clear or solution there are some worthy is really easy and effortless for getting a basic ui mockup up and it is free for one project is more of a ui mockup tool rather than for you can create ui screen mockups very quickly with a wide range of ui they have support for maintaining it is free a 5 min nag but also incorporates with eclipse and other is one of the best tools for ui prototyping and thus very recommend starting out with protoshare with their free if all you need are ui balsamiq is really the best free option out

this bit of not actually getting a reference to your radiobutton in the getradiobuttonvalue function is undefined and throwing an get the value out of the radio grab the and then use to the desire to reinvent the t for if t modify the original line of code to read your function weird disable normal form submit return prevent further bubbling of which of the following do you like the moved the function call to the an alternative would be to change your submit button to a standard and put it in the onclick event for the i also removed the unneeded in front of the function and added an explicit return on the value coming out of the the function i modified the how the form was being the structure form control to get at since you renamed your from you had to change the to the is just wrong in this as it needed to be final was i commented out the that line was not needed for this just to be will provide you direct access to the selected but gets you access to the collection of radio buttons which you then need to since using the function to iterate through the you need to use the difference in this weird return prevent further bubbling of

this is a pointer and not a thus you need the operator that is roughly not exactly the same differ in that you can overload operator or operator in a class and can have different as a matter of if a class overrides and the returned value is not a raw the compiler will keep on applying to the returned object until it reaches a native operator cannot be the constructor you the use of this is completely optional as there is no name collision the code could just have named the attributes without further string string string secret server a better solution would be using an initialization if you are interested in learning google for

this is not possible in with a bit of wickedness more clarification on unfortunately a bit i assume should read one should note that this approach will strip whitespaces from the dragonfly that reads characters which can be anything except the newline character the second part of the specifier rejects anything why the character is if the line has more than characters upto but including the newline the newline character tells to stop what if we did as dragonfly the only problem is will not know where to stop and will keep suppressing assignment until the next newline is hit is another match for the first hence you will trail by one line of input when if you wanted to read in a a little modification is we need to add a to consume the unmatched the maxline stringify these work only in so keep both char maxline 1 wickedness we read from to the format specifier is the only tricky we bite off more than we can chew hence the specification of maximum number of chars width has to go into a so we stringify it using the careful reader will observe that once we read maxline characters we discard the rest upto including a int n if while n if return

this might be an overkill for a small but more this could be a nightmare to maintain when there are changing features and documents are constantly this can be very hard to the way it happend on a couple of very large projects where i worked to this kind of quality level was to be extremely harsh on adding new requirements to the current work this means that the requirements stay stable and it is not too hard to keep all the acceptance test in it is still a full time job for several admin staff and a daily overhead for every engineer i am talking here about loc requirements are only admited after rather lengthy the process is basically there to make the customer think very hard about adding a new requirement to the current adding requirements to future versions is but to add one to the current phase is there is a fixed fee payable just to a requirement and get it read by an architect and presented to a change control once this is done a quote is given to the customer if the new req is complex the quote may be just for further investigation and not even a commitment to implement the it is then up to the customer to decide whether or not to and if they do then the team undertakes to do the work and adds the req to the fixes the adds new test and so the schedule may also need to be adjusted at this approach might not sound commercialy feasible if your organisation needs to be open to new if this is the case then you can still have tracking and a managable level of overhead if you go for frequent that way your current version stays stable as you work on it and you can keep the matrix and docs up to if your customers have new requirements they can add them to the for the next but you keep them out of the current when it comes to the next version you take on all the new ideas and spend time creating a new matrix only after the previous version has do the gurus say about are some these are just personal i read anything specificaly on cmm so point you there by is worth reading i think you mentioned but worth repeating i but i think software might be most relevant to it is a collection of some of which are online at the above 13 case for better software seems to be the kind of thing you are and are 2 of the they really touch on the specific issues you mention and are too early for but if you read them i would try to make time as they provide great also seem to recal published a lot on software quality this day the space shuttle is regarded as an example of probably they highest final have you read any of the or

this originally started as a question about 404 but now a question why the patch that i applied would make a do you get a cached action to return a 404 on all requests that raise an not just the first if you start an empty rails add a product model and setup your setup your cache backend in rake then start in production and hit the site for a productcontroller def render first time the page is it returns the 404 page as every subsequent hit to that url returns a blank page with 200 how do you get it to return 404 every are the curl followed by the curl 404 not 20 apr 2009 curl 200 20 apr 2009 second response is clearly is a copy of the log for the 2 at find product with at chain halted as chain halted as in 12ms 200 ok if you pull the cached action out of the it has some sort of empty garbage in am i doing wrong confirmed that rails and exhibit this but the older versions store an empty response into the cache and they indeed throw a 404 for the subsequent having trouble testing against edge because loading it causes the following error when starting the uninitialized constant tested against the current head of the and it too exhibits this attempted to track down when the change occurred in the rails codebase to determine if it was it seems that seemingly innocuous is where the bug are the details of the where 404 denotes the desired 200 being 375e8976e3 b1c989f28d beca1f2e15 f1fff0a48 f1e20ce9a7 a5004573d8 2e1132fad8 200 the difference seems to start at this c69d8c043f d961592886 276ec16007 0efec6452 13c6c3cfc5 fb2325e35 3cb89257b4 is a patch that reverses the which when applied to tag fixes the am not smart enough to fathom why this seemingly small change would actually make a someone smarter than me could shed some light on the module actioncontroller do include include include include include patch seems to also fix the related showcased where the in xyms 404 not found did not show up in the above patch broke other things in so i delved in and generated a fix for the issue that cause collateral the patch and any subsequent updates will be at rails is the difference between include and include

this should be if you need to require a default case which would require you should consider changing to a of the core design guidelines for structs do ensure that a state where all instance data is set to or null is see design just looked this section up in the design guidelines 2nd and they have an example in detail there using properties and overrides to work around as the basic concept was to save the value privately in a way that 0 is the and do some form of transform in every property and method override in their they used a positive integer as an and always save in the private so the default value is treated like a value of they added a constructor with an int and save seems like a lot of unexpected though so personally still recommend a class in this edit in response to comments as your is the way it is because 0 at datetime uses a ulong to represent ticks from that is why datetime value type represents dates and times with values ranging from january 0001 anno domini through december 9999 is the full range of ulong in a in the struct of datetime is treated as when you convert to a string the values 1 1 a single

till a while a ago my code base was very close to every time i changed an even mildly important file practically all the files got main reason for such high header dependency was that i have many small functions that need to be inline and i was under the impression that for inline to work they need to be in the same translation unit as the calling so they need to be in the for the inline function to even compile other headers need to be included in the header as ad code visual one of the main stated advantages of this is that now inline function can cross translation still how can i really be sure that these functions really get i realize that the compiler can basically do whatever the hell it wants no matter where i define the there a way to check what gets inline functions and link time code

to add information about the file i originally wrote this the has been proposed as a standard and implemented in google opera and nightly builds of safari 6 6 has not been released but once it it should support this ie does not yet support so have to use your existing implementation for the api is a bit more complicated than the older mozilla as it is designed to support asynchronous reading of better support for binary files and decoding of different text there is documentation available on the mozilla developer as well as examples you would use it as file var reader new function function reading does not appear to be a way to do this in webkit safari and the only keys that a object has are and according to the for the file and filelist these are inspired by file but they appear to support only a subset of the you would like to change you could always a to the webkit another possibility would be to propose the mozilla api for inclusion in the mailing list is probably the best place to do if you do then it is much more likely that there will be a way to do at least in a couple years of submitting either a patch or a proposal for inclusion to html 5 does mean some work defending the but the fact that firefox already implements it gives you something to start

to the choice is obviously tfs integration into visual studio is incomplete to say the least lot of features available from the and a bit buggy certainly while tfs one is perfect makes had my whole workspace corrupted several times using svn one never using tfs 2 related features of both systems are probably quite they are accessible directly from the ide with while you have to rely on or other external tools if you use all tfs tasks are accessible in a few clicks on the solution explorer is a lot easier with even for complex merges will add and to your so need to manually edit them to open them again from i think those reasons are more than enough to prefer tfs over i mus add that is more than just a tool work project used it on a project 3 3 business in the and been able to successfully centralize all the tasks in tfs project build not saying not possible to do the same using svn and other but definitely nice to have all things nicely integrated in one stay here are the two obvious drawbacks of tfs tfs is quite a while svn installation is a matter of tfs 2008 over sqlserver 2008 is quite you cannot install tfs on a to definetely the worst installation experience ever had with a microsoft being once tfs is very easy to use for coders not familiar with source control my current i started with and quickly switched to happy i main reason why decided to switch is clearly the overall buggy behaviour of svn was using as a server and as a at least once a i found myself spending hours on cryptical ankhsvn error i found a single reason to regret the switch to

unsure of exactly what you are are you trying to get an equivalent structure definition in for plain old usage or for interop if for pinvoke the follownig structure will struct tpacket public ushort public ushort public byte public byte public you are looking for a plain old structure that has the same unfortunately not possible to do with a you cannot define an inline array of a contstant size in a structure nor can you force the array to be a specific size through an are two alternative options in the managed a struct which has a create method that fills out the array struct tpacket public ushort public ushort public byte public byte public public static tpacket return new array123 new alternatively use a class where you can initialize the array123 member variable op watns to know how to convert a into a tpacket there is no great way to do this in was awesome for this kind of task because has a very weak type system in that you could choose to view a stream of bytes as a particular structure pointer may be possible in unsafe code but i do not believe it what you will have to do is manually parse out the bytes and assign them to the various values in the or write a native method which does the c style casting and pinvoke into that

users are involved mostly when there is no there is only the illusion of not a lot you can do about you could have security questions but even they are prone to exploitation since some people put everything out in the public channels like email offer a reasonable solution to the if the user requests a password reset you can email them a password reset still not as others have but exploiting this would require the attacker to be somewhere in the line of sight between the its mta and the users technically easy but i suggest that the reality is just too much for them to bother on anyone except very high profile the user to supply ssl or gpg public keys at account creation time will help but clueless users know what those things are be able to keep their private keys secure and backed up so they lose the user to supply a second emergency password of like on mobile phone sim could help but likely the user would use the same password twice or forget the second password unless you want to educate your users on security and then hit them with a cluestick until they realise that it is necessary to be secure and the slight amount of extra work is not simply there to be a pain in the

was gonna make this a but it got too seems to have hit on an important though not strongly enough in my are lots of criteria you might use to describe will it be used in a long running app or winforms app or is it a server or client library or standalone etc to me that if your code will run in a standalone app and you have control over all the surrounding then you can roll your own thread start your own and measure and manage the cost around thread thread and resource or you could use the but it kill your app either you are free to the other hand if your code is packaged as a library that may be used in a server or maybe in a sql clr or a wcf service then it is a really bad idea to create you need to use or some other mechanism that exploits the thread pool if it is to be used in apps with other once quwi is imagine that every library wanting to take advantage of computers rolled their own there would be complete chaos in apps that used more than a few rampant all competing for the same no central coordination of vs hygeine that a whether it is to be consumed in client apps or server uses the common and that means thing to realize is managed thread is either a background thread or a foreground background threads are identical to foreground threads with one a background thread does not keep the managed execution environment once all foreground threads have been stopped in a managed process the file is a managed the system stops all background threads and shuts that belong to the managed thread pool threads whose isthreadpoolthread property is are background all threads that enter the managed execution environment from unmanaged code are marked as background all threads generated by creating and starting a new thread object are by default foreground you use a thread to monitor an such as a socket set its isbackground property to true so that the thread does not prevent your process from the

was initially going to say that i like when developers declare methods private as it needlessly places limits on anyone who would like to use their most developers would rather write their own class than attempt to use a class that is hard to use adapt to their which is what you would think a private method would but then i realized that it is really sealed classes that are more likely to cause this i gave it some thought and having a hard time thinking of good uses for protected methods than for something like the template so i looked at code from some old projects and i see if i create a method it is because simplifying a public method by creating helper i certainly want anyone to be able to change the helper method as that will almost certainly break my public be interested in knowing if there was a specific example that brought this topic up that we could or maybe someone has a good example is not the template of a good use of protected

was wondering if there was a better way of handling the case in c where you want to exit a function as soon as you encounter an error in a series of this its a function that returns a null on in some c code where they tried to short circuit error handling by combining a series of statements with and irritates me since cramming so much one in one but i guess the alternative return return what about short circuit error evaluation that seen in perl and bash main problem with this is that the rhs has to be an expression so you really goto or return from the would anyone find this of value or is it too i guess i should have meant to include newlines in the first the problem is that you need to be careful if you decide to add another expression in the circuit error handling in

way past my so i may sound quirky on this seems to me that you have things set up the wrong matching an input string against a list of you should be matching each pattern in the list against the input string and determining a it should be quite straightforward to construct an array of regex patterns by parsing the xml then you can iterate through the array and match each regex against your input why do you need wildcards at wildcards can be considered a subset of regex and so you already have all the functionality of wildcard matching encapsulated within the regex more data on the type of may prove helpful to understand your

way to look at the precise meaning of a const pointer is that you will not be able to make changes to the object that would be visible via that or any other pointer or reference to the same but when an object all other pointers to the address previously occupied by the object no longer pointers to that they store the same but that address is no longer the address of any object fact it may soon be reused as the address of a different distinction would be more obvious if pointers in behaved like weak as soon as the object is all extant pointers to it would immediately be set to the kind of thing considered to be too costly at runtime to impose on all and in fact it is impossible to make it entirely	
way to look at this concept is that the state is represented by the current page and the links embedded in traversing a link changes the state of the application which is represented by the next it is a little hard to the links that are available at any point in time define what actions are available based on the actions that have already this is one definition of current trick is to represent the available actions are uris which on a retrieving the representation associated with a uri implicitly performs the action and retrieves the representation that uris are embedded in the representation and the user understands the action associated with a specific the various http methods help define the that occur and specifies when no action is this is usually what people are getting at when describing the whole restful	
way to solve your problem is to attach a guid or similar type of data to a user and check for a valid session when the page is if there is you redirect to a page saying that this url is not available at the and that the user will soon be redirected then redirect to home after 5 seconds or so using it would work like the user is a session cookie is created with for example a the is also stored in a database in which you have one column for the primary key and one for the you also create an authentication thus logging the user on to your all datacalls etc are the user has been successfully registered and so you redirect to the confirmation the confirmation page is the user is automatically logged on you created the authentication cookie in step you can then check for a row in the table corresponding to the logged on if there is such a you delete the and display the confirmation page with all the if there is no such you display the error message and as you deleted the row when you showed the message the first the user will not be able to access the confirmation page if you use this approach some other that makes the confirmation page available only you should make sure that it is clearly stated on the confirmation page that the user be able to access that page	
way to try and diagnose it is to see what happens if you replace the expression with the with just one of the it only happens for strcmp and not then it could very well be because of the const i think that while can always be converted to you convert const to as it is with then perhaps this is about some issue with function where having the converted to but the signatures should be identical and having voids instead of chars are a

ways you could approach two queries in your tab one for active users and one for inactive then on your report simply drop two tables and point one of them at the dataset and the other at the the one query which returns all active or along with a column for their now drop two tables on your report and point them both at this single in the properties of each set up the filter so that one table only shows active users and the other shows inactive favour one of these approaches over the but probably lean towards the second approach since only one round trip to the the overhead of filtering during the report rendering might not make it worth though have to try it and	
wcf can use it the wcf rest library is ready to usable in wcf starter kit is something it delivers extra it includes a set of vs project samples and a few tools for building rest apps or with one cool tool is the xml as command to visual the other building a rest in the general recommend taking advantage of the httpclient assembly in the starter kit and a and dependency even at the current status of the starter you were consuming just a single rest then you need the general you can do all the stuff it does in some code that uses but if you wanted a more general flexible class for manipulating rest then grab that

went with team system and have been very probably got more stuff in it than i will ever but my thinking was do i want to spend my time on configuring and maintaining a lot of free software and roll my own development environment or spend my money on an integrated environment that our server guys could maintain for i decided that my time was worth a whole lot more to the organization writing code and was enough of a justification to make the investment in it much of a sell to my manager who fully agreed with since the server guys already maintain sharepoint and sql server for other not even much more effort for them just another server to worry about out of the dozens already since running it on a the hardware costs are i were working for my calculation may have been i would that you need to consider the expense not only of the software but also in terms of the amount of time willing to devote to maintaining your you need to consider the opportunity cost associated with pulling bits and pieces of your dev environment together and maintaining it when you could be writing paying

what i can you are going to to loop over the contents at a portion of there is no other way of talking about an arrays as a fast not the you could compute a hash over the array something int hash foreach c in hash has the risk of some false positives a dup when it is but is otherwise quite any you could store the hash alongside the data in the database to allow fast checks but if you do that you should pick your own hash algorithm for it guaranteed to stay the perhaps just convert to an for example or to the existing int hash foreach c in hash an aside for you could always just think in terms of a 64 character and just check this would work equally well at the database and

what most of the answers so far the meaning is exactly the same as in any two expressions a and b evaluating to a b and a b do almost the same b evaluates a and and if one of them evaluates to the result is b does almost the same except it evaluates a and then only evaluates b if it is since the entire expression is true if either a or b is b need to be tested at all if a is so and skips evaluating the second operand when where the operator will always evaluate operator often and often it make a the only common case i can think of where make a difference is foo null assuming returns a works because the member function is never called if the left test that if foo is we call dostuff on would give us a used the would be called regardless of whether foo was null or only the operator is and is a bitwise as the other answers the operator defined for integer types so hard to get them mixed up in

while back a post by jon skeet planted the idea in my head of building a for using in a loop instead of idea is that the portion of a call to spent parsing the format string is we be able to improve performance by moving that code outside of the the of is that the new code has to match the week i finally did i actually went through using the framework source provided by to do a direct adaption of their parser turns out actually farms the work to the code i came up with in that my results are accurate within my test i still have one in my initial tests the performance of my code closely matches that of the normal no improvement at even consistently a few milliseconds at least still in the same order the amount slower it stays within a few milliseconds even as the test set but i was hoping for something possible that the internal calls to are what actually drive the but like to see if the smart people here can improve on things is the relevant class public int of item in the argument means a literal from the original format public data from original format public string format to use with supplied argument for for format public int means it should be at least 7 characters public bool would use opposite data is all populated by the parts new int basesize string iformatprovider formatprovider icustomformatter customformatter the code in here very closely matches the code in the could it be string if null args throw new var sb new foreach fi in if throw new if throw new object arg string s if s if if is s else if s if s int pad if pad if pad return implementation comparative my own test call i use but useful to how my format method string return wary of providing the source code for my because not sure of the licensing implications from my reliance on the original anyone who wants to test this can just make the relevant private data public and assign values that mimic a particular format very open to changing the class and even the list if anyone has a suggestion that could improve the build since my primary concern is iteration time from front to end maybe a linkedlist would fare something else i can try is adjusting my my benchmarks were fairly composing names to a format and composing formatted phone numbers from the area and extension neither of those have much in the way of string as i think about how the original state machine parser i think those string literals are exactly where my code has the best chance to do well because i no longer have to examine each character in the class is still even if i make it go as long as performance is than the base still created a interface that allows a program to assemble own at run all i need to do is provide public access to the parts comparing to

work for a billing service that uses some complicated billing software for core we have all kinds of codes we set up that are used for tracking payment provider each type of code has a completely different set of data items that control what the code does and how it am tasked with building a new system for tracking changes made to these we want to know who requested what it was and and what the exact setup looked like for that the current process only tracks two of the different types of this project will add immediate support for a with the goal of also making it easy to add additional code types into the same process at a later my design conundrum is that each code type has a different set of data that needs to be configured with of varying so i have a few choices could give each code type own and build them considering we only have three codes concerned about at the this would be this concept has already failed or i be building a new system in the first also weak in that the code involved in writing generic source code at the presentation level to display request data for any code type those not yet is not a db schema capable of storing the data points associated with each code not only but what type they are and how they should be displayed list from an enum of some i have a decent db schema for this but it just feels overly complicated to query and and it ultimately requires a custom query to view full data in nice tabular for for each code type the data points for each code request as this greatly simplifies the database design and will hopefully make it easier to build the just set up a schema for each code then have code that validates requests to their transforms a schema into display widgets and maps an actual request item onto the what this item lacks is how to handle changes to the questions how would you do am i missing any big design any other to those current inclination is to go with the xml given the schema updates are expected but extremely infrequent less than one per code type per 18 should i just build it to assume the schema never but so that i can easily add support for a changing schema what would that look like in sql server 2000 moving to sql server but that be ready until after this project is supposed to be reason thinking xml is that some of the data will be enumerated drop down but i really need to query any of so i was thinking it would be easier to define this data in xml le point about introducing a whole new technology hit very close to we currently use very little xml slowly but at the moment this would look a little out of also not entirely sure how to build an input form from a and then merge a record that matches that schema into the form in an elegant it will be very common to only store a record and so i want to build the form from the record a topic for a different on all the comments so far xml is still the leading separate tables may be as good or but i have the feeling that my manager would see that as not different or generic enough compared to what currently design help with varying

working with http has anyone noticed that the final two events in the pipeline presendrequestheaders and presendrequestcontent always verified that code bound to endrequest will but will not when bound to either presendrequestheaders or there a reason i thought perhaps it was a caching issue a 304 not you actually send but cleared caches and determined that the server is returning 200 which would indicate that it sent is a problem because the statuscode of the response defaults to 200 and my understanding is that it get updated to something like a 404 or 206 until those two final if i check the statuscode during it will always read presendrequestheaders and presendrequestcontent run

would be the ideal location to check in third party reference for a project in a version control typically i have seen most people to put them under so that the runtime can automatically pickup these however is that the right way to originally wanted to have a separate directory which is parallel to bin called lib which will contain all third party but this needs changes to the applications config file so that the lib directory is picked up by the run my idea over here is that lib will contain third party while bin will contain the projects binary be dll or is the preferred the concentration over is the location in the version control and not just the physical file of third party in version control for

would be working on extracting the specific business logic code in the mfc app and sticking that stuff in a rather than trying to wrap up the whole might be making a false assumption here that it will take you less effort to wrap the mfc app up as a dll removing all the gui adding a dll main and modifying the build process to produce a than the effort to isolate the business logic code and put that in a new dll wrap the gui up as a dll you will need a pretty good understanding of the dependencies of the business logic code and how it is used by the so you may as well just cut that stuff	
would caution that guids are random they should not be used as the basis to generate anything that you expect to be totally random of the winapi guid generator shows since the sequence of v4 guids is given the initial state one can predict up to next 250 000 guids returned by the function this is why guids should not be used in as random just use the random something like this found string stringbuilder builder new random random new char ch ch return are fine if you want something a unique filename or key in a but they are not good for something you want to be a password or encryption so it depends on your microsoft says that random is not that great either generate a cryptographically secure random number suitable for creating a random for use a class derived from such as

would definitely stick with the immutable version if you really need the class at immutability makes it easier to reason about your code if you store a reference to a useful to know that not going to the performance is almost certain to be insignificant the io involved in reading the line is likely to be more significant than creating a new if concerned about should should the code before you decide to make a design decision based on those performance if your state is just a are you really providing much benefit over just storing the strings directly and having appropriate methods to analyse them does analyse the string and cache that or is it really just a bunch of parsing

would like to build on a this is what is known more generally as the idea is the first code is the it tells you how to interpret the the second code is the which tells you how many bytes there are in the this is a great way to do extensible binary encoding and is used a lot in mpeg would add in a few more on a good functional binary a in each message that states the protocol version for the every field in byte consider the size of each using a encoding scheme for i find a good but the idea is that the top bit is 1 if there are more bytes and 0 if this is the last byte and the lower seven bits in each byte contains the everything on to the wire as bytes and never first one is really it is more important that you plan for change and carefully decide how the protocol will clients should never attempt to interpret a message if they support the version fifth one is pretty important when it comes to having a stable written quite a few binary protocol implementations for embedded devices and using packed structures is the mistake that i regret the i have had too many defects related to forgetting to byte swap a numeric field or not packing a just write a nice library of byte packing and unpacking test it and use it you design and implement the protocol with these principles in it will make your life a lot easier when you have to support and the last thing that i would highly recommend is writing a dissector for something like for your it will also make and supporting things easier as just make sure to completely understand the possible legal implications of writing such a dissector as well as deploying one before you consider

would make the contents of each tab be called in by a separate ajax this would give you the following each tab can easily be a different only need to load the contents for a tab when it is you be processing html for tabs that the user you want to use this you feel you need to load all the contents of the tabs on page download in a single then you could separate out the code using helper methods and see my answer	
would not expose repositories directly to the the first big problem as you mention is you trust the so you cannot expose your data access api to potentially hostile your repositories with services on the server and create a thin delegate layer in the client that handles the remote your entities is not necessarily a bad practice just that it becomes problematic when you start to factor in things like lazy sending data over the wire the client if you write a dto class which wraps one or more entities and delegates calls you can actually build up a dto layer pretty especially using code generation available in most key to all of this is that a set of patterns should really only apply to a part of your not to the whole the fact that you have rich logic in your domain model and use repositories for data access as part of ddd should not influence the client in any conceptually the rias that i build have three uses something like mvp or mvvm to present the the model layer eventually calls i might call the this is a contract of services and data objects that exist on both the client and server to allow the two to usually the ui design drives this layer so that only the data that the client needs is passed to it and data access can be one method call for all the state needed for this set of using whatever it wants to handle business logic and data this might be ddd or something a little more old like a data layer built using stored procs in the db and a lot of or point really is that the client and server are both very different animals and they need to vary in order to do you need a layer inbetween that is a fair compromise between the needs of the ui and the reality of how things might need to be on the one big advantage that and javafx have over flex anything is that you can use a lot of logic in the first two because you have the same vm on both sides of the flex is the best ui technology hands down but it lacks a server component where code could be shared and more	
would not use either this the purpose of seems to be to process a that job is to process the in the second version of it is implicitly given a second to create the the semantics between version 1 and version 2 are not the of doing i would consider having just one function to process a and another function which creates the if you need such a const process return new these functions are and if all needs to do to get job done is literally just call then there may be no point in having the but sure that in your actual situation these functions do much more than what is being shown and my code above illustrates a fundamental approach to semantic one function one job to design i have above for the function also illustrates another fundamental approach that i personally use in my code when it comes to designing interfaces which includes function that is i believe that good interface is easy and intuitive to use and difficult or impossible to use in the case of the function we are implictly saying with my the vector is required to already exist and be by designing to take a reference instead of a it is both intuitive that the caller must already have a and they are going to have a hard time passing in something that a	
would one go about creating a custom action in cocos2d that was able to perform a over making each call to the callback progressively longer than the last call to it something similar to the easeexponentialout action already provided with similar to does not sequence self repeat ease play above code executes the entire 18 times and then executes the callback at the end of the last the easeexponentialout does not appear to have any affect at all on the action that is created i had expected it to adjust the duration of the action inside of the but it does not appear to do also attempted to create my own custom action based on but failed easing action with	
would pass in a void as i think you can use variable number of arguments in a callback i could be wrong void void void list your the user wants to pass multiple then they would pass a struct through containing whatever they	
would personally go prefer to use underscores because studies have shown that they improve readability of code immensely versus can also understand arguments for just using rather than so not averse to	
would personally say keep it simple and stay with an autoincremented primary if you need something more in terms of display in the then possibly one of your other but i think that is just adding unneeded complexity to the primary key	
would probably fit your needs very nicely does for me in very similar you would prefer something a little closer to what currently you may want to look into are a number of here on about and in general fairly easy to find info on	
would probably need to put an outlet for your uiimageview or its controller in your application delegate to make it accessible	
would probably read it like int void example in the question has an explicit	
would provide a neat solution to your depending on the user ask the user to fill more from your problem statement its looking that you know how many projects need extra fields and which do if you know this data then feed this data into a database and then accordingly generate your form however even if the data is available dynamically with the use of an interactive javascript and ajax you can easily achieve a neat	
would put all the webmethods into the same the webmethods should only be wrappers around you business classes plus whatever input validation and authorisation you web services are generally used by mahcines and not humans there is no pressing need for a it can become a burden to manage the urls and web server if you create a webmethod class per business you are planning on using the html page that browsers automatically generate to call your web services as your main user interface you need to be a little bit for example you be able to rely on soap headers if you need to authenticate	
would recommend choosing a piece of software that you like and and finding a way to contribute to fix an annoyance or bug that you have if you see any annoyances or look for the bug this way a project invested and you are already at least partially up to speed on how the code works from an	
would recommend copying the views to sql server and then use its sophisticated tools to help you grok sql server can tell you what stored rely on a particular so you can see from there whether the view is a or if actually used in more than one it will help you determine which views are more important than	
would recommend textmate without any the most configurable editor every used on any it is so worth the small registration fee but try it for 30 days to see what everyone is raving	
would recommend trying something like from where like escape is the sqlite way of adding a bound rather than having to declare a new one each comment jennings is you have to quote the value you are

would recurse until you got a stack	
would run a stage analyse the data in the csv files to work out sensible capacities for nvarchar or i would get it to print a report with an example entry for each column indeed even generate the sql statement which you can manually edit before if every entry in a column formats as a number then make it an and so a thing i fully expect that you should visually check each table you would be creating first before running the data	
would say it depends on what exactly you are trying to afraid you cannot avoid a post unless they support some query string variable or have a way of setting a in a cookie or that have to figure out by a standard you will have to mimic user actions in some form and which means sending initial get request to extract all form field and then creating a post to simulate the post this inside a regular browser would be i i remember if javascript allows to set headers and i guess you could use ms active if your goal is to extract data in some you can do it relatively are plenty of samples on how to use httpwebrequest or webclient for screen including simulating logins and i would use send a get get preserve extract form create a post recreate headers proper form proper post reassign and you should be see what needs to be i suggest using a fiddler run then browse to the click on a the filder will show you all traffic and all necessary information on both the initial request and subsequential post

would say that every new language improves your programming so learning new ones is always a good i find that learning languages belonging to other paradigms than the one currently most used to is a smashing way of becomming a better for learning prolog made me truly understand recursion for the first smalltalk and ruby helped me understand the beauty of dynamic lisp just blew my mind and c made me realise what was going on behind the thinking of learning a new i say go for c will help you understand memory allocation like nothing else going for even stuff like and will help you love any other language you may know so much of	
would say that in most cases the data is not suitable for ui why you almost always put a a layer of logic in between to interpret the db information to the another thing is that when you generate the ui from db you will end up displaying the inner workings of the something that you normally want to it depends on where the db came if it was created to exactly reflect what the users goals of the system if the users mental model of what the application should help them with is stored in the then it might just but then you to start at the users if not i suggest you go that	
would say that the easier to use and more complete distros are debian and have been a redhat user i switched to fedora when that project started simply the open version of some releases are some are just but on average i have had much less critical problems than with other distros i have right now i am using fedora and since my mother has been able to use i guess they have made real progress in user interfaces and	
would say that the library should be independent of user this case the in that having a dependency on a config file is not so do want the connectionstring in the of your but you want to pass it to the library through a parameter at some this would allow you to use the same library in a non web also it would allow you to implement different ways to get the connectionstring a webservice

would start with the even a using sql compact as an offline data	
would start with the the only tool you have is you treat everything like most important is to know many different programing languages and inform yourself well about the tools on your any problem can be solved in almost any language you be it full blown mainstream language with its huge default library or small specialized language like the first job of programmer is to determine what to use according to the specification of the some concepts provide better approach to whatever your main goal may be small code size you will finish like some of programmers who desperately try to do something in a 1 language they while the problem could be trivial to solve in different programming advice goes along with todays tendency for projects web applications for which may involve several languages in single like and even different programming paradigms introduced recently some concepts from functional programming the basic thing is

would use online instead of your old i usually recommend but basic stuff it is a good place to start and a lot of times it shows you both vb and so you can better translate what it is you want to was in the same position you where about 3 years ago is now my prefered and what really helped me was to take one of my existing vb applications and rewrite it as a stuff seems to much better when i do it just read about	
would use the in this as it is more and has easier are right that they are pretty much going to both perform in although the be faster given it have to perform a delegate invocation incur a slight overhead as opposed to directly calling have to stress how insignificant this difference more than likely never going to make a difference unless you are doing a number of operations on a test to see where the bottlenecks are and act

wpf project utilizes the itunes at several background threads that work to load the itunes library from the api into memory is for performance reasons once the app is loading the library is painfully on the order of nearly three recently tried saving the library to a dataset so load times would be quicker and i could just update the dataset in the background once the app is however this did not really work it properly save the also tried using a local mdf but that went wrong for reasons i remember think the main sticking point is that i need to save the com question i do you guys have any ideas on how i can load this library more running out of way to load or cache from an extremely slow

writing a module and want to have a unified exception hierarchy for the exceptions that it can this allows users of the module to catch those particular exceptions and handle them if but many of the exceptions raised from the module are raised because of some other failing at some task because of an oserror on a i need is to the exception caught such that it has a different type and so that information is available further up the propagation hierarchy by whatever catches the but i want to lose the existing and stack all useful information for someone trying to debug the a exception handler is no since trying to decorate the exception before it makes its way further up the propagation and the handler is too is partly solved by deriving my specific exception types from the existing type but that make it any easier to wrap the existing exception instance in a new nor modify the chaining and embedded discusses a change accepted in python for exception to indicate that a new exception was raised during the handling of an existing trying to do is i need it working in earlier python and i need it not for but only for what is the right way to do exceptions with a different type and preserving existing	
writing a program that implements scvt centroidal voronoi i start with a set of points distributed over the unit sphere have an option for random points or an there will be from a several hundred to maybe 64k then need to produce probably several million random sample for each sample find the nearest point in the and use that to calculate a for that weigh may have to be looked up from another spherical but that set will stay static for any given run of the i move the original points to the calculated and iterate the probably 10 or 20 this will give me the centers of the voronoi tiles for subsequent i will need to find a given nearest to see what tile the user clicked this is trivially solved within the above and need to be the part i need to be efficient is all those millions of nearest neighbors on the unit any using z but not set in it just looks like it will simplify also using c as most familiar with but not wedded to that choice considered using the spiral pattern for the sample as that gives me at least the last found neighbor as a good starting point for the next but if i do it looks like it would make any sort of tree search i thought i was clear with the title and i can generate random points the issue is the nearest neighbor an efficient algorithm when all the points are on the unit neighbor on a unit with roughly evenly distributed

writing a wpf application and trying to figure out the best binding approach but have been coming up only solutions and hoping a better have a border object derives from inside a the size may change because of a child text the position may change because other things in the grid may rearrange the cell that the border lives want to draw a line from the lower left corner of the screen to the exact center of the border the endpoint of the line in the exact center of the border must always remain in the center regardless of what the size or position on the can i accomplish idea is that binding to a dependency property seems to be the ideal way to handle i could use an ivalueconverter on a binding object to calculate the exact center given and to find the upper left i figure out what dependency property i should bind to that will alert me when the border changes size wpf dependency property should i bind to for finding the center of a

writing some code that needs to work against an array of different database server 2000 to 9i adaptive server anywhere sql openedge have a set of generic integration tests that we need to run against each database as part of a continuous integration sure other people have had to similar test environments and i would like to tap into some of that wisdom what strategies do you end up what worked well or did not work virtual machines for each of the each allocated a small amount of memory to manage for certain or where we have slightly different for individual couple of virtual machines or even a single virtual machine for all the products perhaps an ubuntu box for postgresql and a windows 2008 server machine for the remaining i like one or two because this is a more portable environment for running the tests when on the road as my laptop would probably crawl to a halt running 8 or 10 small finally how have you tackled the prohibitive cost of some of these commercial products oracle or progress and are the previous versions still available are there free editions or cheaper routes to purchasing these up a diverse database testing

writing unit i know very popular to write test methods that look like void this makes it easy to see what the test is testing i think it looks ugly and it display well in documentation sandcastle or interested to see what people think about using a naming schema that is the method being tested and underscore test and then the test then using the xml code or the javadoc comments to describe what is being tests for user authentication with a bad void doing this i can easily group my tests together by what methods they are i can see how may test i have for a given and i still have a full description of what is being have some regression tests that run vs a data source xml and these file may be updated by someone without access to the source code and they need to be able to read what is being tested and to update the data the the long test method names to describe tests vs using in code	
written a few of these a couple of things you should as mentioned by you want some kind of this is important for a number of but the main one is that it gives you additional flexibility in case your servers going and you decide users should be credited with an additional day of free just push back their value by a this also makes free trials simple to use stuff like automated recurring even if working on a subscription you want to be in full control over when the payment gets and offloading that responsibility to your gateway is just a bad idea in most most gateways will allow you to store a credit card on their give you back an id for that and you can issue charges against that intermediate id instead of the card log all i overemphasize this in you should probably expose this log to the user as basically just a table of all of the payments the and the final common to put invoices into this table as invoices have a positive payments and credits have a negative and just sum everything for the user to obtain the final you can introduce arbitrary credits to this table very easily if so a cron script that fires every 24 hours that checks what users need to have an invoice this cron script should have three critical if it run for some you lose a worth of if it runs more than once in a or if it gets aborted through and it charge people and if the date on the server gets changed to 2090 by it automatically bill all of your users for millions of resets to dates in the past jan should also cause it to raise daylight in my is rarely an think that covers most of the big but there are always little gotchas in billing systems that you have to watch out

written tests after the better late then they are always worth i have to the first time i wrote them before writing the tested it was extremely no more fiddling around with manual i was surprised just how good it i tend to write unit tests before refactoring legacy code almost by means that writing tests to test code already provides a security blanket that makes me more comfortable with getting into big blocks of code written by

written two commercial products that use an access running from a network for typically up to 10 if you abuse really no but as you can see many developers ever get there and because of its low end there are a lot of crappy hacks built on in the case of one i had to redesign the app because of all the problems described in detail by but after i cleaned it i never had a database integrity issue across hundreds of one big advantage is the single file which is easy to back and copy to your laptop to pretty much all the including sqlite some admit require some form of dba attention now and most access provides record and file locks for some ddl schema by microsoft is basically obsoleting and some of your colleagues will heap scorn upon you for using this point i normally duck for cover and yell	
wrong here but i guess you want to use the performance table here as a kind of summary of the other cumulativeact are sum values of the plnhec and acthec columns in the other you really need this to be a new table as the summary data can all be extracted from the 2 original tables via sql procedure or perhaps a you really need to replicate the i would use something like

wrote a winmm library wrapper library that exposes waveout and wavein classes for the purpose of recording and playing raw audio works but in order to follow the operating system specs on how to handle the finished i added a thread that unprepares the buffers and frees the i also got all of the synchronization so that the classes are solid and there seems to be a rare issue where i add a buffer to the waveout device and the operating system returns a success but if the device is reset immediately the os does not mark the buffer as finished and return it to the seems that it is loosing the the problem keeping track of the count of individual buffers sent to the device and blocking joining the function to the thread that cleans them or known this does not seem to happen on a quad core in but does happen on my dual core in xp totally willing to expose the full source once i get it uploaded and propery licensed on if that would help posted library to is an idea of what causes the partial class mainview private wavein wavein new private waveout waveout new public waveformat format new tweaking these values affects the internal buffering setting too small of a queuesize with too small of a will cause buffer which will sound like choppy void datareadyeventargs if lock we have to check for null after the because waveout may have been inside another if private void formclosedeventargs if lock wavein if lock waveout library

you apply some ddd logic which compliments the in the state of the ui belongs in the application which can talk directly with the domain and infrastructure layers and the concept of ddd makes you about how to solve the solution in code step through the progress state you want to maintain here is the step or progress of the my first step would be to document progress or such step get step get in this i would apply logic to the model to the next most likely with a method on the a registrationservice but it belongs in the app would create a service in the application layer called i would place a method on here called but the domain would not hold the state of the model in this want to focus the state at the application so in this would act upon not a model object it is not part of the domain but instead the you need something to retain the state of the registration away from the domain how about a now we know we have to retain the state of something in the mvc allows for a concept called viewmodels not sure what ror calls a viewmodel represents the model that will be displayed by the partial viewmodel would be an excellent place to save the state of this call and stick a method on of means that the application layer would have to retain the location of the and the application layer would change the internals of it based on nextstep if it is you may want to create a in the application layer and place the within it to abstract your logic to pass the viewmodel final piece is how to track the state of that since web applications are you have to retain control by some other means then the in this i would revert to serializing the viewmodel to the client and letting the client pass it back and or keep a copy of the and pass some type of identifier back and forth to the client and is a good example to think as i have not performed this myself for the most secure and insured way of saving the state of this viewmodel is to persist it to the via the infrastructure layer the app layer can talk directly to the infrastructure that seems a lot of work to for something that may die off and i would have partial registrations sitting in my would keep the private info cc all on the server side and not pass it back and an after walking through we came up a in the application a with a in the application is persist the viewmodel to the database through the infrastructure you never have to track what on the view or ui as the viewmodel gets updated and updated persisted to as you move your next concern would be to in the this is easily done with 1 using step or named but i am writing code below as that is my class registrationcontroller public actionresult return and this posts back to note the setting of property on the model public actionresult registrationprogressviewmodel the logic in here checks business rules around the verifies if valid it increases and finally the viewmodel to the db through the switch case wire up the view for step2 return case wire up the view for step3 return case wire up the view for step4 return return to first return notice that this abstracts the of verifying the internal state into the the your url is a nice and clean post which expects a viewmodel with specific properties filled if the viewmodel is not does not advance to the next

you are going from bright colour to bright colour as the hex values then you may wish to interpolate in rather than rgb hsv space approximates how we think about colour saturation and rgb space approximates how the light sensitive cells in our eyes upper gradient is linear rgb interpolation from ff0000 to its middle value is a muddy middle gradient is a linear interpolation in hsv as both ff0000 and 00ff00 are fully saturated and have the same value the interpolation keeps the same brightness and saturation so the centre value is bright yellow third alternative would be a vector rotation in rgb which would mean the is b4 hex 180 dec 255 which is somewhere between the two this is done by calculating the magnitude of each end then scaling the result of the rgb linear interpolation so it is the same effectively sweeping the vector in an arc in the plane of the two colours and the as we actually weigh different colours equally for or see not but it does have a fairly even intensity across its whereas the hsv one is a bit lighter in the as got two values at where you have hsb support the algorithm is simple get the hsb of the end linear interpolate them as in the other rgb then convert create a colour with the color hsvinterpolate float color color c1 hsv0 new hsv1 new float alt hsv0 hsv1 float h mix hsv0 0 alt hsv1 0 float s mix hsv0 1 alt hsv1 1 float v mix hsv0 2 alt hsv1 2 return v believe has the conversions built so the code much use color vectorinterpolate float color color c1 float alt double x0 double y0 double z0 double x1 double y1 double z1 double mag0 double mag1 double x mix x0 alt double y mix y0 alt double z mix z0 alt double mag mix mag0 alt double scale mag return new color clamp x scale clamp y scale clamp z scale int clamp double value int x round value if x 255 return if x 0 return return probably want to find the intersection of the vector with the edge of the rgb cube rather than simply clamping but in this case it matter either

you balk at the i know it is very cliche but i used the term web because it will help you understand what i am trying to do i want to build a company that builds web or desktop applications that interact with or some derivative the question where can i learn all the individual tools to be able to do this from a technical i pretty much have the business stuff taken care if i wanted to setup certain systems at least know what i am dealing with so i can talk to people where can i learn i am pretty and i have some programming under my belt a in computer i will be brushing up my programming but the more i is the more i realize i of the things i want to learn more practices for web practices for ux design administration learning the ins and outs of unix command line bash code best teams of architecture how to setup a staging production environment for both and remote development tracking project management best practices from a web development shop system architecture a small db serving a site with few visitors to dealing with else that i might have left off that can be included as for a startup to know in this day and about apis and when should i aim to get one published and how to go about starting that about web services the benefits of using a framework django or instead of developing from the ground suggested list of that i should get familiar with for a variety of projects that assist with drawing diagrams both use any relevant diagrams that i will that assist with creating high quality pdf for each would be greatly i know a and i expect one person to be able to answer but something i have always been curious about and have never encountered any blogs that cover this sort of so figured i would ask in i know that publishes books on some of the but i hate going and picking up any random book without getting a recommendation from someone before i have done it many times and the book has never helped because they always assume that i either know something or the technology is outdated and they teach it in a way applicable to me to help me do what i want to so think of it from the perspective of someone that understands the basics of tech literate consumer of social so i am not starting from ground but not 20th floor somewhere in between floors 2 mastermind astutely pointed this question is a bit so narrow it down to just languages and all preferences for all the apps and php eclipse can i find a good set of resources to build a company from the

you can do as long as the widths of the elements to be distributed are known in but a bit trick you want a spacing between each element of that is width of the parent element minus the total width of all the child divided equally between the number of gaps between the css have the ability to do we have to hack it a first we add a margin to the parent element of the size the total width of all child so now the parent has width and we can use a padding value in relative to that for for four images of sizes 40px and 80px our is set that as the parent then the children can have of that width as padding between funny tag indentation is to avoid there being any whitespace between is necessary because with the parent width set narrower than the page it otherwise be possible to fit all the elements on the in ie you may need to add a wrapper div around the lot with to prevent unwanted scrollbars if spanning the whole and certainly want to be in standards can work with textual elements if you make them inline blocks so you can add and you size them explicitly in it work if the sizes of the child elements are not known in advance they contain dynamic as you know the value to be honest i would probably just use a the table layout algorithm copes very smoothly with calculating how to distribute spare table for best results with or to respond to dynamic this way you also have to worry about pixel rounding	
you can do bitwise operations on consider print	
you can do not sure if call it a best but certainly a good idea to make rather rudimentary arrays a bit more if you need dynamic almost a requirement to group the various fields needed to do the bookkeeping you have two sizes in that one and one this is a tradeoff where you trade fewer allocations for some paying with a bit of memory times arrays are only used and are of static which is why the operator is so handy to determine the number of your syntax is slightly off with by the how it usually i sizeof array sizeof do stuff with each that is not a the parenthesis are not always one example of a wrapping exactly as that which you describe is the type provided by the part of the declaration is exactly what you struct gchar guint are expected to use the provided api to access the array whenever not poke these fields

you change the source code for the legacy com have to work around one possibility is to create a new vb6 component that implements and which does the actual work of getting the password by calling back into your this the vb6 code can deal with the and the code see of the code to make it work will be vb6 which you can put into a new activex dll project and reference from your is an outline of the different classes and interfaces this class is a wrapper class that hides the parameter from the when this property is called by the legacy com this class will call a helper class in that will do the actual callback the vb6 class will then take the results from the helper class and return them to the legacy com this class is used to pass the parameters from a call to to the helper class that will doing the real this is the interface that your code will implement instead of implementing is the code listing for each of the vb6 components mentioned you can add this code to a new activex dll project and compile it for use from your each file is listed as an make sure the property for each of these classes is set to to pass arguments ownerneeded as isvalidresult as this is the interface that your class should implement of function args as as property set callbackprovider as set property get byval ownerneeded as byref isresultvalid as as function byval ownerneeded as byref isresultvalid as as if is nothing callback dogetpassword end the arguments in a passwordcallbackargs not need to fill here the callback provider will do dim args as new the password and a value to put back into our byref dogetpassword isresultvalid to use this the above code has been compiled into an activex add a reference to it from your put the code that you would have put into your implementation into a new class that implements remember that the callback parameters and are passsed to your provider class in a so you will have to use and in your class to refer to is a stub provider class to get you a stub implementation of an ipasswordcallbackprovider class mypasswordcallbackprovider implements public function as string implements dim password as string dim resultwasvalid as if other end even more whether the result was valid or return end order to pass a valid to your legacy com you will need to create a set its and then pass the wrapper object to the legacy com the above and assuming you have a instance of your legacy com component called you would do something like the following to set up the create the callback wrapper wrapper new tell the wrapper to call our custom ipasswordcallbackprovider new pass the call back wrapper to the legacy com object sure how this is done in your just pretending a property since i this works because implements the interface that the legacy com object is expecting to the in turn provides a way to hook into the callback process via the the com interface is compatible with so you can write an implementing class using the calls your to do the work of getting the and makes sure to put a value back into the

you compare a float and an but the problem you will run into is on most float and int have the same size and wildly different precision neither type can hold all values of the other since one type cannot be converted to the other type without loss of precision and the types cannot be native doing a comparison without considering another type will result in precision loss in some you can do to avoid precision loss is to convert both types to a type which has enough precision to represent all values of float and on double will do just so the following usually does a f i

you could actually write a preprocessor in lex and put it into your build but thats can use start switching between them with and parse input then use unput to push characters back into the then a different start condition can parse the result recently wrote a parser for a config language that did just the parser had two modes one to count tabs at the start of a line to determine and then another to do the actual methods are fine but there is usually a better way of doing especially if your input scheme hugely there a gramatical difference between and for your would a whitespace eating rule do the describe your language and grammar a little so basically you have two something and if your tokens are seperated by white space you can do the will match a single return will match a run of anything thats not a tab or line return ignore your something token you could also match something like which will match a letter or an underscore followed by 0 or more underscores and that

you could do something like not as easy as implementing an interface on your but it also means you need to tie your class implementation to your choice of di container by inheriting from a di container specific interface not sure how much of an issue that is in believe that constructor injection is far more commonly used right and property injection is widely seen as a fallback for cases where it is not feasible to get the di container to perform object construction for you i could be wrong there just my view on the you really think that property injection up code and tests quite a interesting because i sort of think the opposite i think constructor injection is and guessing that could be simply because how i normally do it so what used

you do not provide a namespace then your type has no remember that namespaces have any meaning they simply get appended to the beginning of you name to create a longer name that has a greater probability of being i think that you may have two separate assemblies and one ought to be referencing the other but it is if two projects are in a single solution then the class viewer will show all types from all projects but that does not necessarily mean that references in order to use the types from in you need to ensure that a project reference

you have a lot of data in your i would double check that you have indexed all the appropriate because this can make a huge on your local dev you probably have a lot more memory than on your 500 mb which would result in the db running a lot slower if you have un indexed you can also run the slow queries logger in mysql to pinpoint columns without than passenger will need to spool up a process for you if you have not been using the site if this is the you should see a significant speed increase on and especially third and later page

you have a small enough using adequately svn commit and exploit them a tool that generates an rss feed trac for can be an easy and efficient way to promote are several requirements for this to which are quite easy to commit frequently is good in as it allows everybody to benefit from each local and to identify problems use verbose comments is good as it allows to trace more easily what was in case anything breaks ensure everybody actually reads keeps posted through an rss the there is no way to to such but if someone really needs to probably between that person and the so mail is usually other useful tool is to ask each developer once a write a 10 or so bullet point list of recommendations for fellow on a topic is really familiar

you look at the game or simulator industry you find a lot of plus maybe some added scripting there can also be tools written in other languages for scenery design or related but there is only very little lisp used in that you need to be a good hacker to get the necessary performance out of lisp and to be able to access or write the how do you get this fail there is nothing but writing code and experimenting with lisp is really useful for good software engineers or those that have the potential to be a good software of the main obstacles is the either you have a very simple one you have a performance problem with random or you have a sophisticated one you have a problem getting it working only few garbage collectors exist that would be suitable most lisp implementations have good gc but still those are not tuned for or near exceptions do with you can forget the because there usually is other alternative to automatic memory management with a garbage collector is to use no gc and manage memory this is used by some lisp applications that need to support some response example process control expert nearest thing that was developed in that area was the also later game for the playstation i games were for the playstation from naughty since they have been bought by they switched to for the playstation their development environment was written in allegro common lisp and it included a compiler for a scheme lisp on the development system the code gets compiled and then downloaded to the playstation during they had their own 3d engine always got excellent reviews from game incremental level complex behaviour control for lots of different so the playstation was really executing the scheme but memory management was not done via gc they had to develop all the technology on their own nobody was offering tools but they because their were excellent software since then i heard of a similar note that this was not just lisp for scripting it was lisp all the way the scheme side there is also a new interesting implementation called it is developed for a pinball game this could be the base for other the common lisp there have been lisp applications talking to flight simulators and controlling aspects of there are some game libraries that are based on there are interfaces to there is also something like the agent there are also some 3d graphics applications written in common lisp even some complex but in the area of flight simulation there is very little prior the topic of clos functional probably one would use if you need to squeeze all possible performance out of a then clos already has some overheads that one might want to

you not just use a static variable specifically for those that will have the same as the you should probably think carefully about any concurrency but it sounds like the simplest way to keep a value just and although one instance of can be used to service multiple each one only serves one request at a time which suggests that multiple instances are created for concurrent request i validated but it does sound like it be safe to keep it in an instance answer suggests that you want this to be that sounds slightly odd to as unless got a of these events quite likely to only ever see them execute on different making the whole sharing business if you really do want that sort of suggest just using an instance variable in the class for exactly the reason described in the paragraph above

you override you basically become responsible for making sure that your nested controls get created approach seems pretty for your simple i do not think you need to be calling if you picked this up from the msdn docs on the take another look the property example that they give is retrieving the text value from one of its child which means that the property accessor needs to make sure the child controls cannot guarantee when someone might access your which is why you would put in calls before any access to a control in your controls in a normal page will get called when gets around to adding your composite control to the this may not happen until prerender on the first page load if nobody touches your control and it databind or subsequent createchildcontrols will be called during viewstate or any code might touch off a composite control to start creating child will do it for example and this could happen in that i think on the right

you really need to represent the subscription level in the user why you add a subscription type in your relation would then be expressed a user has one it could also be modeled as a relationship if you wish to keep an history of when you want to change the subscription level of a instead of instantiating a new user you would create a new subscription and assign it to a when you user signs when he upgrades to a paying a trialuser really that different from a probably you would be better served with aggregation instead of subscription data can be stored in a separate table as an or it can be stored inside the users table as a

you should consider creating custom activities for each of the major the custom activities will be composite activities that can be composed of many this will help things a bit and allow you to continue working with the workflows at a relatively workflow while is not really designed to scale very as of vs the best way to work with technologies is to use the text editor and the xml it down into several workflows not be the best approach unless you can break it down into a few activities and are working at the xaml keep in mind that if the logic and flow is nearly identical for all of you will now have to maintain 6 different this is a nightmare if your workflows are complex and you need to fix a common logic error across all of should also consider the use of the this may allow you to have one workflow and one set of but the implementation of each step can be isolated into a in this you would need to instantiate one workflow per load the same workflow into and inject different not necessarily the best but something to

you there are various php implementations of but i know of any in since not a language typically applied to web going to depend on how complex of an implementation you want to come up very restrictive whitelist is probably the but if you want to be really comprehensive i would look into doing a conversion of one of the established versions to as opposed to trying to write your own from there are so many tricks to worry that i think be better off standing on the shoulders of others that have already gone through all know anything about using for web but converting php to it seem like it would be a particularly difficult php really have any magical capabilities that be able to sure there will be some small but overall if you want to go the route definitely still be faster to do a conversion than a full design from seems like a strong php implementation that is still actively comparison where the author discuss some differences between his approach and probably worth you come up definitely test it with all the examples you and make sure it passes all good

you thought about using http since really the primary data here is the and the serverhtmlversion is a sort of about that it should make the response to the request blank when the versions match and the html for use the pragma http header to send something like by doing you can easily check if the client and server versions and just grab the full response if people would debate the idea of returning html from a rest but i personally would consider this totally and an nice clean way of separating your meta data from the actual user

you truly want to do cross platform development easily i would suggest using one of the already built engines like unity or one of the garage games stuff like torque game builder have virtually zero experience in either so tell you which is better but the torque game builder demo get through the first tutorial without having problems and they answer tech support questions in their forums like they claim to do so i can say avoid them if you are a novice in game design like the big thing about garage games was supposed to be their great i saw zero support and in fact only saw a bunch anybody posts with no answers so i guess they are pretty much giving up on supporting their

you ultimately i is to have the user type depending on the user will get slight different the first will not fulfill but the second on the price of code you can do is to invert the struct vectorbase struct struct struct vector implement the few functions that depend only on n being some specific value in the appropriate you may add a protected destructor into to prevent users deleting instances of through pointers to they should not even be able to name put those bases in some implementation like idea is to combine this solution with the one mentioned in another inherit privately of publicly as and add wrapper functions into the derived class that call the implementations of the another idea is to use just one class and then to enable or disable them for particular values of or use a transformer like this which is much anyi struct i2t anyi struct forward to the void case for n void case for n void general void it is completely transparent to the user of it also add any space overhead for compilers doing the empty base class optimization

you want to provide multiple values to a one clean way to do this is to have separate one for each instead of trying to pass them all in one another clean way to do this is to create a new class that combines all these values into one and expose a single property of that for class private as private as private as public property destination as return end end end public property due as return end end end public property expected as return end end end i think necessary to implement property procedures instead of directly exposing the internal field values in order for the properties to show up in a property if you have this then you can create a property of type traindetails on your control that will encapsulate all these properties in one i think they will be editable in the property grid as a single property with an expandable next to it to edit the individual

you want to use an unmanaged class from managed you some nasty to load the class member functions and make a nastier managed wrapper class to call the member this gets even worse when there are virtual methods second option in my opinion is is to write a wrapper class mentioned that familiar with that is a simple proxy to the unmanaged for every member function you have in the unmanaged class have a similar one in your proxy then a simple case of adding a reference to that dll from your managed and be able to use your class as any other take into consideration that run into more work if your class exposes other unmanaged stuff that be you need more information on the second i could look up some old links that explained this technique

you would have one comprehensive domain model for the you can use the domain model in your service layer or the controller if it is a small for your you can use presentation objects to make the views easier to these are sometimes also called dto or view model basically what you do is create an object that contains all the data from the model that is necessary for the view to be model may class public string class public string want the view to output the name and model of the car and you would have to pass both the car and driver model objects the than sending the two model objects directly from the controller to the you can create an object which contains just the data you class public string public string would populate this object from the domain data and pass that to the and the view would you have to worry about lazy loading issues or complicated view logic to deal with model more work to create these view model objects but they really help keep the view clean and provides an easy way to do formatting before sending data to the are projects and conventions you can use to help automate the creation of the view if you want to look into is an

your dlls to be you need to protect all shared data structures that multiple threads in one process could access concurrently there is no difference here between writing code for a dll writing code for an multiple processes there is no risk in concurrent as each process gets its own data segment for the so variables with the same name are actually different when seen from different it is actually much more difficult to provide data in a dll that is the same from different you would basically need to implement the same things you would use for data exchange between that a dll is special in that you get notifications when a process or a thread attaches to or detaches from a see the documentation for the callback for an and for an example how to use this in a so if your threads are not completely independent from each other no shared data is then you will need some shared data structures with synchronized the various notifications may help you with properly setting up any data structures in your your dlls allow for completely independent execution of the exported also do check out the note that for them and sections are not but maybe the thread notifications can help you there as

your implementation is pretty close to the the classic example of a the only issue i see is the role of blockinfo is being changed in between the steps then your implementation is what you need to look at the wikipedia article i point is being changed between and mouseup so it has to be a parameter of a abstract blockinfo is not being changed between the steps then you have several things to the class implementing parseddatahandler is initializing any part of the blockinfo structure then i would separate that out and make it a private member of the class and just have blockinfo pass in the initialization data that is external to the parsing blockinfo is being modified by beginblock and passed to the subsequent routines then you should clone store it internally in the class implementing then eliminate it from the parameter you need blockinfo afterward i would make a readonly property that return the internal on your question my guess you should pass blockinfo into beginblock and store it eliminate it from the parameters from the other methods then add the readonly property if you need to retrieve

your looking for a project that templates a rest correct in saying there is no out of the box restful web services are possible using the key part is to use several attributes when defining your service functions that let the framework know that the function is not expecting the main attribute to use is the is an example from uritemplate post above code will actually be defined in an interface for your web the interface is created automatically when you create your wcf web service the actual code for the function will be placed in the class used to implement the web out the article on for a full it might seem overwhelming at first if your new to but after you dive into sure start to pick things up here is the link for the answer all of your in you should be able to build restful services using but if you have the option to use i would strongly recommend going the route of wcf since it is much easier and is designed with rest in converting your project be hard at just a matter of targetting the new version of the framework in your project converting a web service from a service to a wcf service will be a bit trickier the easiest way to do so would be to copy the code from each of the different web service functions into the class where you implement the new version of the shinanigans not sure what this starter kit is that referring restful web services should be fully supported in wcf which was fully released as of it would be helpful to understand wcf at least a little before but not crutial to understand it completely in order to get i would recommend just reading through the article on at least and then begin sure you will come across other questions as you but you can look up those parts as you come across i hope this information good luck to improvements have been made in the rest as darrel miller mentioned in the wcf was not in fact built with rest in i in fact the framework is built with soap in mind and the webinvoke attribute fills the although there is a lot of debate around the topic api vs wcf web api is a new option for building rest services in i would strongly recommend that anyone who reads this post and is able to use in their project look into it as an
