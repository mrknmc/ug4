32 bit integer basic math operations of add and multiply are computed implicitly mod meaning your results will be the lowest order bits of the add or you want to compute the result with a different you certainly could use any number of bigint classes in different and for values you could compute the intermediate values in 64 bit long ints and use built in operators to reduce to the right been told that there are special tricks for efficiently computing mod c when c is of the form or that use 64 bit math or a bigint library and are quite more so than an arbitrary modulus and also properly compute cases which would normally overflow a 32 bit int if you were including the intermediate despite hearing that such special cases have a fast evaluation i actually found a description of the that in that somewhere on are the mumblings apparently is a common technique in random number generators which are doing multiplies of mod since 2147483647 is a prime number equal to ask the this clever special case method that i find any discussion mod c quickly for

a little confused at going on looking at the puzzle example from atomic object showing how to test a pattern view has a private the view also has a function that adds the delegate to the the presenter is passed in an iview and an during it subscribes to the view and hooks it up to a function on the unit testing the the view class is mocked using so it is just a dumb and the function actually do of to test the you have to mock up the view and then trigger the event in the view and ensure the model function was the example code works just fine i understand how it private dynamicmock private ipuzzlemodel private dynamicmock private ipuzzleview private savedtypeof public void modelmock new model as setup the viewmock new view as moverequestconstraint new create the new public void point point new pointdelegate trigger as the call is actually connected to the and is causing the private event in the view to i figure out how this is working i see where it is connected to the view what am i i am trying to use nmock it appears that the moverequestconstraint variable receives the value that is passed into in the testsetup that is nmock 1 syntax and nmock 2 does not appear to support that how would i do it with nmock noob triggering event in mocked interface class how does this code	
	
a little experiment i ran in an oracle database aside from implementation i figure out why some insertions are accepted and others table b unique index on into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values that it makes sense to occasionally have some rows with some column values i can think of two possible use cases involving preventing i want to reject but accept when any constrained value is i want to reject even in cases when a constrained value is oracle implements something different reject but accept when constrained column values are can think of ways to make use of implementation to get to use case for have a special value for and make the columns but i figure out how to get to use case other how can i get oracle to act like table b unique index on into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values into sandbox values can i constrain multiple columns to prevent but ignore null

a pretty cool but i know enough about your requirements to know if it will work for you or i am thinking first of all if i were using a chat i would like to simply click on a message and have it be copied into the after i think of anything else need to click on a message it would be great if hovering over a message caused it to be and clicking caused it to be that works for your then the question is how to achieve i am thinking that you could use a label to show the username who sent the and a readonly textbox to show the message every time a new message is added to the you insert a new label and a new textbox adding these controls to the controls collection of the probably should wrap the label and textbox in a so you can highlight the entire div when they how do you make clicking cause the text of the message to be copied to the it will take some if using a javascript see what it if here are some the javascript code would need to get only the contents of the which it can do by looking for the right css class or the right and copy that text to the clipboard as described in these for copying to 2nd link about javascript for copying to 3rd link about javascript for copying to 4th link about javascript for copying to the maybe you have the requirement that users should be able to select the text of many in that perhaps clicking on a message and you can have multiples a button for all selected the only thing this handle is selecting part of the text of a so it may or may not be right for your

a rather extreme approach check out roy timothy yuan vesta approach to software configuration vesta approach is based on the following versioned storage of all sources and vesta uses explicit version numbers rather than configuration by we the descriptions name all elements contributing to a every aspect of the computing including header environment is fully described and controlled by we mean that configuration descriptions specify how to system from scratch using only immutable sources descriptions themselves are versioned and immutable and is a particular description always describes precisely the same build using the same even after new versions and descriptions have been derived file the storage and naming of derived managed automatically by the vesta storage thereby easing of building multiple releases or building for multiple target caching of all build vesta features a shared build results so developers can benefit from each dependency the vesta builder dynamically detects all so none can be omitted by human by we mean that the builder detects which sources are actually used process of constructing a build result and records dependencies only dependency analysis does not make use of any knowledge the build tools it is thus in the terminology of gunter for if a compiler reads file in the compiling file vesta will assume that the output all of even though a tool with knowledge of c might be able to items in that could be changed without changing the the	
	
a rather old big and complex codebase for a program originally targeted at it turns out that some sections of this program are written in an obscure dialect of x86 assembler called lap after the company and product that produced the assembler done a fairly deep google search and unable to find either the original assembler or any information or documentation about i have found some rather frustrating pages on experts exchange of people asking similar i be able to get this thing to compile until i can either find a copy of pharlap assembler or find enough information about the dialect to translate it to a more masm like either or try to muscle through just figuring it out by reading if none of this is then i just need some help with this and i should at least be able to get one section of the program to a struct declaration in a file that looks like struct bhash struct void rgb3 int int int ulong temp var used by blackbox to us int global so assembler code can see then some assembler that looks like which is presumably trying to make the same type declaration so that some assembler code can use the same cachedata dd pointer to cache data dd contains dd error diffusion dithering dd dd dd rgb value with dithering rolled dd cache dd to use you also need dd uncomment a few lines dd search for to find dd extern the lives in compiles with an error on the last line which looks like this external definition different from previous i think what this is saying is that the assembler version of this struct match the c version of this tried a number of different combinations of word and dword in place of dd in the but i get past this little maybe if i could find a way to get these two declarations to match my need for information about pharlap would be if anyone can think of a better title for this sprawling open to okay it turns out i skimmed over some important this is a file originally written for a phar lap assembler i that trying to assemble using the watcom assember the problem with that particular it turns is it seems phar lap is case while watcom so it sees bhashctl as the same as figured this out with the help of my brother in i never would have thought of case insensitivity being the cause of that lap i need and binaries if

a situation like you may be better off using a simple call to or throwing an choice will depend on how you see this class being if it will be part of a and you expect other developers to frequently supply incorrect values for or you should probably throw a proper word of if you expect the of your to frequently supply incorrect then an exception is a bad exception handling in is an expensive if these checks are in place for the sake of the you should perform input and report errors to the user in a much more friendly here is some quick sample if minimumnumberofsides of is too low be minimumnumberofsides here is so that goes into detail about exception handling in

a think you need to consider the relative costs of both functions the absolute cost of for control essentially compares the current threadid with the expected if you look in reflector the code is slightly more complex but in effect what this is fairly cheap as just a few function calls and a involves taking several adding delegates to an invoke queue and potentially a marshal between this code is much more expensive relative to the actual invokerequired call an order of magnitude or you would need a great deal more calls where invokerequired returns true before you would see any gain by just going straight to

a to an is something known in the c standard as a arithmetic so not an reason compilers often issue a warning on this by default is because so commonly done in code there would be far too many warnings issued in there is an awful lot of code out there that works with values to deal with things that are inherently unsigned buffer sizes for also very common to mix signed and unsigned values in not to say that these silent conversions responsible for it might not be a bad idea to enable the warning for new code so from the i think probably find it rather overwhelming to deal with the warnings issued by existing

actually compiler a few people here are saying as easy is unfortunately only half of the yes that would space on the but there are a couple of the compiler had emitted references other to instead of if you compile with then need to be even with frame compilers do this by space allocated with must when the function big one is point because you the compiler to emit code to symmetrically add to at every exit point of the most likely case is the compiler offers some intrinsics which allow library writers to ask the compiler for the help in glibc implementation of the implementation of is simply define thinking about the minimum i believe would be required would be for the compiler to use a frame pointer in any functions which usees regardless of optimization this would allow all locals to be referenced through safely and the frame cleanup would be handled by restoring the frame pointer to i did some experimenting with things like do char unfortunately not after analyzing the assembly output by it appears that optimizations get in the the problem seems to be that since the optimizer is entirely unaware of my inline it has a habit of doing the things in an unexpected order and referencing things via the resultant push mov sub sub this and the line below are our mov dword ptr mov ptr mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via esp call 8048338 mov ptr mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via call 8048358 mov ptr mov dword ptr compiler still referencing via call 8048368 you can it so i stand by my original assertion that you need compiler

added a web deployment project to my solution to create a clean deployment of my web this works mostly as builds the source then copies the files to be deployed to a folder excludes things like source files and my now i want to explicitly exclude some other files the sake of simplicity lets just say one file called i add an item group to the wdproj file as does indeed exclude the specific file as but now the files excluded by default are no longer now all my svn files are in the release folder also a source folder at the same level with all the source in it seems that defining the excludefrombuild item group is overwriting some set of rather than adding to exactly a show but not does anyone know how to simply add a file to the default excludefrombuild or is it a case of using the defaults excluding everything by hand deleting the files you after a default to excludefrombuild itemgroup with web deployment

addition to all of the other hints and i think missing something your functions actually need to you create or the idea is that this will be a function that you can and it can give something you figure out the output that you want your function to you need to put it in a if you wanted to to return the list of rather than print you would need the line if you want your to return the dictionary you would use be more precise to answer your you want to a function that makes a you want to return the dictionary while inside the the last line of your function should be the for the solution from think you need to go back to the beginning and read a book or website about python in particular and programming in since you are slightly rusty on some of the one good one are of is

addition to enabling you to be sure you got the code you tried to download corrupted either intentionally or if you check the the practice of including hashes when publishing code is good social since people who share or sell software often include hashes with their and we believe that some people routinely check them some download tools do it crackers will find this to be a less useful way of spreading those who only check the hash on or those who never check can have more confidence that the software is what it purports to if crackers tried to start injecting viruses or trojans into download they would be detected pretty and the attack repaired and you can help everyone by occasionally and even if you the presence of the hashes should provide some reassurance that the code is probably as the author intended and the same code downloaded by many other

advantage of storing data in the db is taking advantage of db security mechanisms and reducing maintanence cost the disadvantage of it is increasing db load and consuming connections might be expensive for licensed database if you are using sql server might be a nice the for web apps any other apps that might need streaming the usually more sensible to store data outside	
	
advantage of using folders is that you need to have a custom handler that fetches those blobs out of a database and turns them into regular also simpler to host them from different locations and avoid the burden on the database have to be careful about storing the relative pathnames work better as urls and will allow you some flexibility and scaling in where you store how you serve and so van den	
	
advantage to using the asynchronous calls is that not wasting a thread blocking on threads can be so in a situation where doing lots of key to use threads the apm is awful to have to if you do need and have the flexibility of using another language for part of your try the make it a breeze to write async

advice i got from mysql about things like this is in trying to optimize a query based on tricks like this can be a curse in the long there are examples over history where technique that relies on how the optimizer works ends up being the bottleneck in the next the query that answers the question asking if you want a count of all use if you want a count of use where col is not index and leave the optimization to the trying to make your own optimizations can sometimes make the optimizer less there are things you can do in a query to make it easier for the optimizer to speed it but i believe count is one of the statistics in the answer above are not sure whether there is actually something at work in the optimizer in this just talking about optimizations in	
	
advice is to not set the 404 header yourself and let the web server do it for this is done through the status which the web server should take and turn into an or 404 not found the header is not a real http header and is used solely to communicate information from an app to the server	
	
advocate but why are changes elsewhere breaking their would unit tests actually prevent this are people breaking or changing interfaces between code unit tests and are great but the code has to have a contract to adhere getting these programmers to write unit tests will help determine when you have a but does it get you closer to preventing those it sounds like there may be a larger design issue that needs to be	
	
afraid the short answer is that you do this using the filefield or imagefield they just store a file path and have no real concept of the actual the long is that anything is possible if you leverage the django api for writing your own model a want to implement the method to convert the data for serialization an example in the django docs at the link note that the examples at the url link above also include mention of subclassing filefield and which is helpful for your also have to decide if the data should therefore be stored in the or on the file if the you will have to implement your custom class as a blob including customization for every db you wish to also have to provide some support for how the data should be returned to the user out of the database when the html requests a if the which is the smarter way to go have to implement methods for binary data to the either if you implement these as subclasses of filefield and you should still be able to use the admin tools and other modules that expect such django and only if you elect to use the more involved blob a snippet of code from an old project of mind when i was learning that handles blob for mysql and probably be able to find a number of improvements as i touched it since it does not handle so have to add that using the method import import the blob value so that we can override the unicode after the query django attempts to record the last and at that point it attempts to force the query to this does not work for binary data and generates uncaught def def return def return field for persisting binary data in databases that we def if return elif return raise def if if value is return return return def if value is return if return return

after the filters join the try to join and then reason is that you lose use of your fulltext in response to the using the word join generically not as but as a synonym for merge or essentially saying you should use the first or something like the reason faster is that each of the subqueries is sufficiently uncluttered that the db can use that full text index to do the select very joining the two much result sets is also this means the whole thing is slow version winds up walking through lots of data testing it to see if what you rather than quickly winnowing the data down and only searching through rows you are likely to actually

agree that 32k items is a ridiculous amount to have in a that being you might try adding the items to a tstringlist first and then use a combination of and add your items to the code but i test it further than never felt the need to add more than a few dozen items to a combobox or if any more items might be needed than i find a way to filter before populating the list so there are fewer out of how do you expect a user to sort through that many items to make a

agree with jeremy what describing need the complexity of callback the worker nodes could simply expose a wcf service even a wsdl or rest web service for that and then the controller would simply need to know the urls of each of the child nodes and send messages to the worker you want the controller to be able to broadcast a single message and have all of the worker really dislike the i long ago switched to calling it nodes do something in response and post their progress back to the then you might want to use the often underrated p2p channel available within this allows a group of services written in wcf to talk to each other all at once as peers with urls being used almost like for you might issue commands on the only the controller sends commands on that channel but all of the worker nodes when done doing their thing they can report progress back on the an added benefit of this approach is that you need this the individual workers would gain the ability to know what all the other workers are in however that if you use p2p then have to deal with contention you may end up with 2 nodes accepting the same if this is then p2p is your if you need commands to be issued and only picked up serially by individual nodes as they become free more likely scenario when telling remote nodes to run individual test then you can use a msmq binding instead of then all of the workers become clients which receive messages from the queue and you can more easily counteract the situation of multiple workers accepting the same additional blog post i wrote a while back on the peer channel scenarios on this is good because you can go from here to peer channel concepts to the reference channel team

ajax encompasses a client side framework it is perhaps best for its server side particularly the what you get with ajax is ajax for the basic without having to write a single line of on the other hand you to write some javascript or go a little working with ajax can soon become a little on the otherhand is lightweight and requires you to write although for most the jquery guys has done a very good job of hiding the ugly javascript stuff so apart from a small learning curve it comes pretty natural if you are on in css problem in using jquery with can be if you mess too much with the dom you might get validation

all depends on how you use if you use gaia to make a website then pick apart the created code and figure out how it did the things it did then it will help you learn the flip side if you just publish websites using it and bother to pick it apart to learn the internals then it will simply be a crutch allowing you to never learn how to do it an ability to create something that you could not have otherwise and if you cannot use it again in the you will not have any clue of how to do it as a learning not just a building that was all general comment on building tools in specifically relating to gaia like to add that personally i think most top end devs make their websites much much better than the gaia framework as a matter of only recommend using it as a base learning then building your own framework that you can constantly improve on as you get

all in the in many not databases will need some level of customization for individual but generalized databases can provide a basic level of it is possible to design something that is general enough to serve many basic but the problem is that that generality of design tends to lead to high for you can design your database to be for a large set of potential user but just better to customize the schema to the individual needs of the are significant tradeoffs involved in designing for a reusability usually they involve time and easier to design something that is not and the additional amount of time invovled in making the general design and using it is not worth the

all the big hardisks even developers seem to forget how many bytes there are in a so to answer the question in the games store large amounts of data by creating savegames that are several megabyte illustrate how big a megabyte 8 million that is sufficient to encode in there are only atoms in the now in a there are multiple subsystems with distinct in a rpg each npc has its own but how much of a state is their position in a town might be saved as 16 bits you remember their position if walking around their as another 8 and that allows for more emotions then some people it comes to storing this kind of data the typical datastructure is a this is a datastructure that allows you to determine objects in a certain region in in some game developers find it easier to the world in this reduces the amount of a good example was its maps had visibility for each point one could determine quickly to which zone it and for each zone the amount of visible objects was this reduced the amount of objects that needed runtime visibility

am currently developing on an advertising which have been running just fine for a while apart from recently when our views per day have shot up from about 7k to our server cannot take the pressure on this anymore and knowing that i am not the best sql guy around i can make it but not always in the best i am asking here for some optimization i hope that some of you will be able to give rough ideas on how to improve this i specifically need just to see the light it is at the when an advert is supposed to be shown a php script is which in return calls a stored this stored procedure does several it tests up against our customer database to see if the person showing the advert by a primary key is an actual customer under the given locale system is running on several languages which are all run as separate next up is all the advert details fetched out location as an height and width of the and lest step calls a separate stored procedure to test if the advert is allowed to be shown the campaign expired by either date or number of adverts allowed to and if the customer has access to it got 2 access systems a blacklist and a whitelist and lastly what type of campaign is the view unique and so code consists of a couple of stored procedures that i will post in procedure called from procedure bit bigint int int set nocount declare declare declare declare declare declare declare select must be valid ie exist and actually be a if select return must be a valid exec fetchadvertdetails if select return end exec canaddstattoadvert if begin insert into values function declare declare set from where customerid and deleted 0 and isapproved 1 and isblocked 0 and localeid if set set return fetch advert procedure int int set nocount on added to prevent extra result sets interfering with select set nocount select from advert as inner join campaign as t2 on where and and 0 and if is return return procedure type of stat to bit bit bit money money smallint bigint set nocount declare declare declare declare declare declare select select select select select campaignid from where id if is select select moderationtype from where id if 0 and 2 and or 0 or and if not a click or view then type must match the campaign only able to do leads on lead no isales or click and view campaigns however can do leads select take advantage of the fact that the variable only gets touched if there is a which is supposed to override the existing if there is select earning from where canpaignid and publisherid if select if not is select advertsleft from where id if select if 0 select from where campaignid and publisherid and if select else select from where campaignid and publisherid and if select if select if from as inner join as on where and and and and and 0 select select 1 not and set status to be ip if 0 and 0 and select if select if 0 or select am thinking this needs more than just a couple of indexes thrown in to help but rather a total rethinking of how to handle i have been heard that running this as a batch would but i am not sure how to get this and really not sure if i can implement it in a such way where i keep all these nice checks before the actual insert or if i have to give up on some of all help would be if you need any of the table let me know for taking the time to look at it optimization on advertising

am developing a log parsing service that captures specific security events in the windows event my initial thought was to use but i am not looking for any functionality beyond selecting specific ids already known in some i found that iterating over the entire collection was over 3 times faster at pulling data than querying the data to be pulled will be saved in a sql server since the service will perform this duty i wish to avoid duplicate and i will need a way to find the next entry in the collection that is not already in the i can begin inserting to the database once found that initial was just about to write a binary search to find this entry using the most recent timestamp field from the database and comparing it to the property from an item in the this i can but i am wondering if there is already a method to perform this there a method to binary search through the entries in the

am developing a restful web have a bunch of entity classes jpa but also other are gazillions of object binding and whatnot libraries out looking for a one that will enable me the entities to xml and must support using not only object must support by views i mean a way to specify a subset of the properties of the which are to be for an see partial in the social platform i also want it to recurse indefinitely view should define properties to be exposed in the entity and a view for each of them entities the entity might have views and when requesting a view of a only properties and would be when requesting a the properties and are would also be but only with the view it recurse to json serialization must be what would make sense in that means i want proper booleans and nulls and i want extra object wrappers or something that tries to capture the entire xml it must be possible to configure the serialization to use for serializing not xml arrays must be serialized using nested elements so possible to differentiate between empty arrays and properties which present in a given property present in person has no xml and json and merge the data into existing this is the difficult the next two are of must be possible to but which properties are present is not defined in into existing not creating new is a bit tricky to most libraries deserialize into java but at that the distinction between an undefined property and a property it exists in xml as described is being given this being passed a the library touch the entities clear for course with lists this should be more i would expect to configure an id by which it would decide whether to update the nested entity or create a new are a reason why the library must not just return a because at that time a might either mean or been saying a i realize now the library actually provide but there must be a way to add the functionality in a clean fashion not in a way that would make rewriting everything bean serialization and

am pretty new to mvc and i am trying to get my head around some of the design concepts at the one thing i am currently stuck on is how to handle a situation such as that described i have a page that needs to render a number of for on the left hand side there is a list that is data driven and then the selected item in the list displays a further list in another section on the for better understanding lets suggest the left hand list is a list of movie categories and the other list displays a list of movies that are contained within that along with the various movie i have some form of orm such as entity linq to sql or whatever that maps the tblcategory and tblmovie database tables into category and movie entities these entities live in the i then use a repository pattern located in the namespace to encapsulate the queries against these entities to return our model is where my first question should the repository be returning view model entities or domain entities which are then extended to produce view model in my naive mind i see the entities returned from the orm as simply containers for the data with domain entities containing the business so surely there should be an abstration back to my now lets assume i wish to present the two sections described at the beginning of i am assuming that what should be happening here is my domain entity model would contain a list of categories and their associated so something like a list each of which contains a model would have been populated this is my second say my assumption above is correct and it is simply data entities are returned from the now i have a called the with some domain entities such as the movie and category entities mentioned in the previous do these entities have methods on them to retrieve the data from the orm and populate or does the repository retrieve these populated entity and another question on this if i have a movie and customer entity in my orm is it acceptable to be having domain entities named the i assume the controller now has this populated list of category and movie objects and passes it back to the i am guessing it is best to have each of the sections described at the beginning as partial views and passing the populated model to it may be the indexcontroller which retrieves the populated categorymovies passing this to the categories partial view and the movies partial i would then need to somehow determine the selected category and display the appropriate list of movies in that category within the so if anyone has got to this point in my ramblings i will take a deep i hope i have explained my mixed up thoughts and questions in sufficient detail for someone to provide some kind of for partial models and

am trying to play fancy games which have the compiler synthesize hash values of constant strings at this would let me replace the string with a single with a massive savings in code size and programming clarity and be awesome if i could examine and compute at compiletime with simple inline character strings like which are compiletime constant pointers to compiletime constant i can index into these at i can make a template metaprogram to do what i but it is unclear if the standard treats a index of a array as by another const char quite valid but the value v a compile time already believe the answer is but in practice some compilers accept it without even any much less for the following compiles and runs without even a single warning from char void c const char the tricky and interesting compiler will not compile at giving a reasonably coherent error message about using a template with an object with internal suspect the answer to my question is you assume any array reference even to a constant array with a constant index is constant at does this mean the intel successful execution is a bug in the intel a compiletime constant index into a compiletime constant array itself compiletime

an application bundle on os x can only be started however by simply copying the bundle the same application can be launched the best strategy to detect and stop this windows this effect can simply be achieved by the application creating a named resource at launch and then exit if the named resource be indicating that another process is running that has already created the same these resources are released in a reliable way on windows when the application problem i have seen when researching this is that the apis on os x keep state in the file system and thus makes the strategy used on windows lingering files after an improper exit can falsely indicate that the application is already apis i can use to achieve the same effect on os x carbon and to detect whether an os x application is already	
	
an arbitrary real either an integral type or a floating point type is only going to provide an the integral approximation will never be off by more than in one direction or the other that the real number fits within the range of that integral the floating point approximation will never be off by more than a small percentage assuming that the real is within the range of values supported by that floating point this means that for smaller floating point types will provide closer approximations storing an approximation to pi in a float is going to be much more accurate than the int approximation for very large the integral approximation will actually be better than the floating point consider the value which is only off by when represented as 9223372036854775807 as a but which is represented by when stored as a is just an artifact of how printing the values and cannot be exactly represented as floating point values the denominator a power of just as be exactly written as a decimal get where the repeat regardless of the language you the internal representation of this value is going to be the but different ways of printing the value may display it note that if you evaluate in the result is displayed as least on my type you use in scientific calculations will depend on exactly what trying to your answer is generally only going to be approximately how accurate do you need it to what are your performance i believe that the decimal type is actually a fixed point which may make it inappropriate for calculations involving very small or very large note also that includes arbitrary precision rational numbers the bignum which may also be appropriate depending on your

an interesting is there a way to write some code using linq to sql which is capable of performing a table update knowing only that the table it is given contains columns z but not knowing at compile time which table it is dealing have several tables in my db schema which share some columns and i need to apply a set based update operation which is identical in its logical procedure regardless of which one of the tables dealing a simple say you have 3 tables which implement an adjacency model hierarchy each row contains a primary key id and a parent id each of the tables also has a boolean when i disable an instance of any of these it should cascade through the child disabled id or want to be writing these kind of linq statements for each it violates it might seem trivial with this but as the example gets more complex duplicating increasing amounts of sure it must be possible using an interface and perhaps but struggling to come up with an elegant linq statements for tables with common

and compilation are quite but tend to get lumped together because of both being considered of a simple architecture such as a 6502 or z80 will be fairly straightforward for the cpu chunk of the but there will be a fair chunk of code to write since you need to have a function for each want to automate this in some from an instruction set specification with all the timings and as typing this all out will be very tedious indeed old cpu instruction set specs are easy to so this helps a lot when building top of that need to implement some level of which usually involves handling and generating interrupts as the interrupt of a display device if the emulator is for a game this again will need some level of specification and code but likely have to write most of this by hand as not going to be quite so repetitive hence as the instruction set will involve some sort of language spec of whatever language you are going to be implementing the compiler and a target which you will be aiming to output code the output could be straight to could be assembly or could even be another language is really just a but it counts as compilation when the target is considered since be running on some sort of hardware or vm platform then you will be unlikely to have to worry about interrupt handling and that sort of for both are and for the emulator need to make it work very accurately unless you pick very simple things to also need to create some sort of integrated debugger for the otherwise close to impossible to tell what is going wrong when it invariably does for a compiler it should be fairly straightforwward to translate a toy language or a small subset of a more complex and build it up as you go that with both of these items you need to be able to produce input to test and if you cannot produce simple inputs then find it very difficult to get debug from the very alone makes compiler work easier to get and that want to have something which emulates a full console or something straight away

answer describes how i eventually solved my note that while the answer by john dibling was this was not the final solution to my this is because the message is sent as the final message to the but this can be handled before the last message to the window has finished being see for example for an explanation of the is called with calls your your you call ends up calling dialogproc again with calls your call in your having called the object is no longer but you are still technically in the handler so you will probably crash when you eventually get back this means it is not really safe to assume that you can do in since the object may still be live in some other stack a window designed to allow any window to use the method from the atl cwindow you must call subclasswindow for this instance so that the window procedure finalmessagewindow public t the object wanting to receive the final message the t the object that wants to get the onfinalmessage called when the final window message for the window has been processed this is often a good time to delete the hwnd the window virtual void created the above note that it is derived from the atl cwindow class this allows me to use the onfinalmessage handler for this the onfinalmessage handler is different from the postncdestroy in mfc windows in that it is guaranteed to be called only after the final message handler on the stack has then use window subclassing to insert this window as the window procedure for my own roughly we implement the onfinalmessage handler for our delete

answer is developers will need to frig with system configurations to test install software nothing to test the installation process of whatever they happen to be poke about the registry and run software that will not work properly without admin privileges to list a few there are a host of other tasks integral to development work that require administration privileges to in mind that development staff do not necessarily have root access to production admin rights on a local pc does not significantly compromise security of production there is almost no legitimate operational reason for restricting admin access to local pcs for staff that need it to do their the most important reason to provide administrative access is that setting up a compromised or second rate development environment sends a message to your development value your work so little that we are prepared to compromise your ability to do your for no good in we quite happy to do this to cover our pander to the whims petty bureaucracy because we simply be just the best the case is that really the type of control freaks that view it our perogative to tell you how do your job and what you do or need to do make do with given and be that got a job at providing a alone fundamentally work environment for development staff is a recipe for the natural consequences of pissing off your staff inability to retain competent high staff poor morale and poor quality going out of your way to do so particularly if an overtone of pandering to bureaucratic whim is just in mind that your staff turnover just incur costs of replacing the the most serious cost of staff turnover is that most of the ones that stick around will be the deadwood that get a better over time this degrades the capabilities of the departments if your industry is sufficiently close you can also find yourself getting a point to note is that administrative privileges are far less of an issue for development on or mainframe systems than it is on on these platforms a user can do far more in their own domain without needing you will probably still want root or sudo access for but not having this will get underfoot much less this flexibility is a significant but lesser known reason for the continuing popularity of operating systems in computer science

answer the exact there but pretty and it will purely be a you need runtime use a and based on your updated you may have misunderstood how they you need something you can use to represent the of a at compile in everything apart from integers has to be represented by so use a type to represent a a member of type integer that stores a and another for storing their last age typedef int typedef you need something like a that does lookup at compile called it give it support for up to 8 firstly we need a placeholder to represent the absence of a none struct we can the shape of class t0 class t1 class t2 class t3 class t4 class t5 class t6 class t7 then specialise this for the case where there are no void int reason for this will be come clear in a the definition for all other class class class class class class class class struct ctmap public typedef using typename typename t0 return the going on if you will build a type for by recursively expanding the because from and we provide storage for the first field and then discard it when we this all comes to a sudden stop when there are no more because the specialization for kicks we can like looking up in a but at compile using a class as the means we can also do a function that prints one where the member to be printed is a type so we can call it like you can write a thing that is a little like a a little like a

answer to this question is one of process and toolchain need to decide how you wish to access known versions on how you want to make changes to those and how you want to disseminate changes to other vcs systems that are will support common here is one that is is on the time for a tag the a branch off of the trunk at the tag you the code based on the development of new features on the you need to fix a bug in check out the branch and fix release that as creating a new tag changes from your branch back to the trunk as steps 6 7 as needed until your next is another common is on the time for a tag the to production based on the a bug is create a branch to fix that bug against the on the new and that branch back to steps 6 whenever you find a are very common and simple to they are easily supported by most version control if you get more complex you will reduce the toolset but possibly have more

answer to your question is both yes and if you look in the going by version in section see that a stream within a pdf document can be represented by an so you can go ahead and specify that a pdf its image content in the specified problem will be that when you specify an image within you are specifying a particular image that must have a particular data length and simply specifying dct compression and url is not images are contained in streams of a particular if the stream is too long or too it is considered an you can have images dynamically served provided that they are always exactly the same byte i and i say this because the specification is somewhat ambiguous as to what happens when you set the length to 0 in the stream is doing this maybe need a fairly strong pdf toolkit in order to be able to author these and if you have i think be better off authoring the entire pdf document that your clients want on the fly rather than trying to substitute an image at read

are a couple of other differences have any concrete abstract base classes this allows you to provide concrete implementations this can allow an abstract base class to actually provide a more rigorous wheras an interface really only describes how a class is abstract base class can have members defining the which gives more control to the base class than one interface can be implemented on a a class can only derive from a single abstract base this allows for polymorphic hierarchy using but not abstract base this also allows for a using base classes can be modified in without breaking the changes to interfaces are breaking unlike abstract base can be applied to value types structs cannot inherit from abstract base this allows behavioral guidelines to be applied on value

are a few but they are messier than the way you are already i suggest you stick with the current go ahead and embed the sql in the code since you are doing it be extra careful to validate your input to avoid sql messiness the only problem with dynamic remember the dynamic sql thwarts the ability to create a reusable execution the executesql command breaks the ownership that means the code will run in the context of the user who calls the stored procedure not the owner of the this might force you to open security on whatever table the statement is running against and create other security	
	
are a few different ways to track is to link the advertisement any to a redirection you would normally pass it some sort of id so it knows which url it should forward but before redirecting the user to that page it can first record that click in a database where it can store the users browser it will then forward the user them really to the specified redirection script landing way to do it is to use pixel this is where you put a or a piece of javascript code onto the body of a the pixel is just an image a script posing as an which will then be requested by the user visiting the the tracker which hosts the pixel can record the relevant information by that image some systems will use javascript instead of an image they use to track this may allow them to gain slightly more information using landing page user requests pixel is an example of a threw in the png at the end because some systems might require a valid image you do not want the user to know what the tracker is you can put code on your landing page to pass data to your this would be done on the backend so it is invisible to the essentially you can just the tracker url while passing relevant data via the get the tracker would then record that data with very limited server load on the landing landing page requests tracker url and concurrently renders

are a few things i would like to respond i think and vinay all have good this explains why calling the destructor on a local variable is a bad realize this is just a simple homework problem and you are probably just trying to keep your stack class but you might consider a container class instead of an array of in your stack not sure your emptystack and create functions are doing what you think they are when you declare your original and reversed stack classes in the main program the memory is allocated for your internal character not really necessary in this case to have a create perhaps if you were allocating memory on the heap for your character you would put that code into the create function you chose to leave it out of the constructor for some but not the case emptystack really doing it would be better to have empty stack set the stop member variable to at least that way the stack would appear to be empty the next time someone tried to use a lot more that could be said about this but it might be better if you tried some of the suggestions here like using the and this after your homework it will help you a lot more in the future if you find the solution

are no good place to keep your models you can keep them in separate assembly if the project is big and there are a lot of viewmodels transfer also you can keep them in separate folder of the site for in they are placed in oxite project which contains a lot of various classes controllers in oxite are moved to separate project and views are in separate project viewmodels are named and they are placed in ui project in models project they are placed in data which also contains all code to work with database and a bit more i recommend this just for a you can see there are many point of i usually keep my viewmodels in the site but when i have more than 10 models i prefer to move them to separate usually in this case moving controllers to separate assembly question is how to easily map all data from model to your i suggest to have a look at i like it very it does all dirty work for i also i suggest to look at it provides very good architecture for projects and it contains a lot of cool frameworks and guidances and great

are returning a pointer to a local variable this is invalid and surprised you receive a warning about a function exits all local variables cease to exist as going out of and their memory will be used for other you are returning a pointer to this but no guarantee what will now be this case it seems that at the time of the printf call the memory contains a 0 which is treated as an empty this is actually quite you could easily end up with either garbage being printed or the program resolve this you can either pass a buffer into or have czas allocate a buffer on the heap which you later i would recommend the former because it is inline with how virtually all library functions it also avoids memory allocations where the caller must later free the struct tm time timeinfo localtime return strftime char buffer if to czas i notice that strftime took a size updated the code to use this and correctly pass back the result from as a result this is far more robust and you cannot accidentally overflow the

are several problems with the model used in the main one being that it express the actual dependency instead it just concatenates a bunch of definitions in a certain often resulting in definitions coming in a different order in each source the include file hierarchy of your software is something you need to know in the same way as you know your you have to know which files are included from read your source know which files are high up in the hierarchy so you can avoid accidentally adding an include so that it will be included think hard when you add a new i really need to include this other files will be drawn in when i do conventions from those already which can help class one source file one header consistently class a goes in and code templates and snippets are good here to reduce the amount of typing needed to declare each class in a separate the to avoid exposing internal members in a header the impl pattern means putting all internal members in a struct defined in the and just have a private pointer with a forward declaration in the this means that the header file will only need to include those headerfiles needed for its public and any definitions needed for its internal members will be kept out of the	
	
are so many possible answers but take a crack at issues should an application designer take into consideration when devising the error and exception handling you have multiple it should be easy to your error handling otherwise people use transactions wisely to maintain data i see apps all the time where a failure could occur halfway through a process and cause wierd data inconsistencies because the entire operation was not rolled back criticality when you handle for if you have an online ordering system and part of that workflow is to have an sent to the site owner letting them know that a new order was if sending that were to should the user get an error and the whole order be the strategy will differ depending on the software type business hosted web embedded is the software type desktop type or embedded recording information about the environment other apps can be very useful when investigating error enterprise apps and web things like error sms messaging and integration with eco tools become very political and legal only thing i can think of here would be for desktop apps type applications are generally frowned especially if they submit information about the users machine that could be perspectives on error handling business a user try to avoid errors by designing the interface in such a way that it is difficult for them to make ask questions that the user probably be able to answer fail a developer want as much information as possible to help diagnose what happened stack environment a business support management want to know what to do about the error in an enterprise who is responsible for the application do i as well as the criticality and any possible side effects if this batch job what business processes will that written documentation is your friend

are three advantages of splitting time between projects that cannot be doing or consulting on work that requires similar specialised knowledge in both and knowledge bringing consistency into the way two separate products are built and spreading knowledge accross the team on a rare occasion when one of the projects is temporarily on hold waiting for some further time between several projects is beneficial when it does not involve a significant change in a developer to work on multiple software development projects negates the benefit of specialisation any in the consistency and knowledge leaves just the advantage of time however if contexts differ significantly and there is no considerable overlap between projects the overhead of switching will very likely exceed any time switching is a very interesting contrary to its name implying a discreet change the process is always there are various degrees of having context information in context it takes less time to as opposed to however there is a direct correlation between the amount of context loaded on the and output possible to fill your time entirely working on multiple distinct projects relying on reduce the lead but the output quality will inevitably at some point not only aspects of quality that will but also functional failing to accomplish its functional

assignment operator is not required to be made discussion below is about but it also applies to any operator overloading that takes in the type in and any function that takes in the type in below discussion shows that the virtual keyword does not know about a inheritance in regards to finding a matching function in the final example it shows how to properly handle assignment when dealing with inherited functions know about signature needs to be the same for virtual to come into so even know in the following is made the call will never act as a virtual function in d because the parameters and return value of are function and are completely different and seen as 2 distinct virtual x return int d public virtual x y return int values and having 2 overloaded can though define a virtual function to allow you to set default values for d when it is assigned to variable of type this is even if your b variable is really a d stored into a reference of a you will not get the the below an assignment from 2 d objects stored inside 2 b the override is same b as d public virtual x y return virtual x return int char d b d b b2 return 99 99 shows that is never the virtual keyword on you would have the same results as above but the value of y would not be it would use the last step to tie it all can use rtti to properly handle virtual functions that take in your here is the last piece of the puzzle to figure out how to properly handle assignment when dealing with possibly inherited virtual const d x y x y return

autoincremented identity columns have a when used in a restful web working on my first mvc application and trying to keep my urls there is no separate administrative web site for the i use attributes to control who can access what parts of the site and what menu items are visible to the current user based on their roles in the i follow the activerecord db pattern and use synthetic ids for my including the user with the ids being autogenerated identity occurred to me this morning that there is a subtle security risk to using default seeds for identity columns in a restful if you assume that administrative particularly the most powerful are typically created first in an then it follows that they will be the lowest numbered ids in the while not actually opening a hole in the using default values for the could make it easier for a cracker to attack a high value target simply by targeting low numbered ids using restful actions as changepassword which is one of the actions in the mvc site i add setting a seed at my users table to my arsenal of security best is the effect of doing this worth or am i being too as a related should i be changing the template names for columns and security in a restful web

been batting this problem around in my head for a few days now and come to any satisfactory conclusions so i figured i would ask the so crew for their for a game that working on using a component object model as described and actually going fairly well but my current storage solution is turning out to be limiting can only request components by their class name or an arbitrary what i would like is the ability to request a given type and iterate through all components of that type or any type derived from considering this first implemented a simple rtti scheme that stores the base class type through the derived type in that this means that the rtti a sprite would this allows me to compare types easily to see if type a is derived from type b simply by comparing the all elements of is derived from but not and already i want now is a way to store the components in a way that represents that the first thing that comes to mind is a tree using the types as like timer sprite each node i would store a list of all components of that that way requesting the node will give me access to all renderable components regardless of derived the rub is that i want to be able to access those components with an so that i could do something like have that iterate over the entire tree from renderable i have this pretty much working using a really ugly node structure and an custom forward iterator that tracks a node stack of where all the while i felt that there must be a clearer i just think of one the question am i this is there some obvious simplification or structure i should be or is this just inheritly a complex problem and probably doing just fine for any input you for hierarchal component

been trying to write a for the scenario but i just get it to work as i would be very grateful if you guys could help me get it have two tables in a and date destination drivers passengers description contains a string with the usernames of the registered drivers in an event on the form contains the event destination and its value is always the same as one of the values in the field in the table the destination must already exist in tells if the event is upcoming or already executed is the distance to the destination in km from the home i want is to get the total distance covered for one specific only counting already executed if jill has been registered as a driver in two executed events where the distances to the destinations are 50km and 100km i would like the query to return the value know i can use something like drivers like and executed to get the executed events where jill was and to get the total but how do i combine the two tables and get it all to help is very much to get the sum of a column from combined tables in

been writing a lot of code recently that involves interop with the win32 api and have been starting to wonder the best way to deal with native errors that are caused by calls to windows api the calls to native functions look something like nativefunction returns true when successful and false when an when an error the msdn docs usually tell you that error code can be discovered by calling getlasterror long as setlasterror flag has been set in the dllimport is the equivalent managed it throw new line that raises the exception can be equivalently rewritten as such i new this is all well in that it throws an exception appropriately containing the win32 error code that was set as well as a description of the error as the property of the exception i have been thinking that it would be advisable to at least if not of these exceptions so that they give a slightly more error one more meaningful in whatever situation the native code is being i have considered several alternatives for a custom error message in the constructor for new custom error the in another exception object so that both the original error code and message are retained is now the of the parent new custom error same as except using another as the wrapper same as except using a custom class derived from as the wrapper same as except using a bcl class exception as the parent when not sure whether even appropiate to set the to the in this case for a wrapper but not a interface that make it obvious that win32 interop is happening behind the what i want to know what is the recommended practice on dealing with win32 errors in i see it done in code in all sorts of different but i was curious whether there were any design if be interested in your personal preferences you even use none of the above a

believe that the following piece of code is generating memory external function to dynamically allocate a vector template t t v return function that calls dvector after frees it void int double stuff with thought by passing the pointer to it would allocate it and return the correct so that would successfully it does not seem to be the i have also tested with replacing without success have a similar piece of code for allocating a i decided to manage like that because i am using them a and i also would like to understand a bit deeper memory management with i would pretty much like to keep an external function to allocate vectors and arrays for the catch here to avoid the memory have been using the dvector function to allocate types as so that is potentially a i since i have constructors being though in the piece of code before i free the i also would like to otherwise allocate a vector and left it to be assessed through its pointer by other if using it will automatically clean the allocation upon the end of the i get a array with i suppose easily fixed with but what would be the better way for a has just occurred me that i pass the pointer as an argument to other boost seems not to be enjoying it that much and compilation exits with i stand still with the need for a pointer to a vector or a that accepts that will be passed as an argument to other the vector would most likely be allocated in an external and freed in another suitable just like to be copying the loop and new stuff for allocating the matrix everywhere in the is what like to template t int t a return void int double massmatrix function for memory allocation causes memory

believe there more answers to one classic example is to iterate a multidimensional array 0 to for 0 to do something with reason this is cache inefficient is because modern cpus will load the cache line with memory addresses from main memory when you access a single memory we are iterating through the rows in the array in the inner so for each trip through the inner the cache line will cause to be flushed and loaded with a line of addresses that are near to the if this is changed to the 0 to for 0 to do something with will run much

both because a second thread will also get the lock in that but that case happen if all threads follow the spinlock the lock is available has the value when taken by some it has the value no other values are one thread that wants the whether or not it is signaled at the moment that thread called is it is allowed to take the lock if is and it takes by changing it to the first iteration where that happens causes the loop to exit and the thread to have the consider two threads that want the same both are calling waiting to see the value 1 become because the function is only one of the waiting threads ever gets to see the value all the other threads only ever see as and must continue to condition where is 1 after setting it to 0 in this thread implies that some other thread signaled between the atomic operation and the since only one thread at a time is supposed to have the seems like it that guessing that this is an attempt to satisfy the invariant promise of the no longer so more if it is the value of must be if it is if setting it to zero then something weird is and it is best not to assume it is now held by this thread when the invariant is not jon skeet points out that this case might be a flaw in the original i suspect race condition that is being guarded is against a thread that have the right to signal the signaling the spinlock if you trust callers to follow the spinlocks probably the synchronization method of after the proposed revision looks much it would clearly avoid the cache coherency interaction that the original had due to always writing the sentinel reading about the can learn something new every if you pay and the multicore cache coherency issue it is it is clear to me that the original code was trying to do something but without understanding the subtlety behind it would indeed have been safe all callers follow the to drop the redundant check on as it was but the code would have been writing to on every loop and that would have played havoc in a real multicore chip with caching per new spinlock is still vulnerable to a second thread releasing it without holding there is no way to repair my earlier claim about trusting the callers to follow protocol still

built web parts to display items from 2 different and i did something similar to what scott price i used an spquery object for each list and used it to get datatable objects that i could then use with things like repeaters and you could merge your two tables and do something biggest trick for me was setting up the custom templates for databinding in a to do i created a custom class that implemented the itemplate interface and then emitted the html for each item from the template class in an event you just create an instance of your template class and set that as the itemtemplate property of and do a better job of explaining that but the nice thing is that you have complete control of the and you can style it as you

by in the you mean display different parts in different then suggest you use a presentation pattern like fowler describes in his if your developing a wpf app you can use the more version called if you by mean that use different attributes of the entity in different or part of your then i agree with probably be better off breaking them into different the reason being that in your domain model you should reflect how the entity is used in that specific and if using different parts of the entity under different they probably have different meanings in these settings which again should be reflected in the naming of the and if it were probably make one repository for each of the having a mapping between entities and repositories seems to make sense in most cases as far as but then just like rob conery and of the developers trying to do fairly new to the and so my experiences might be overruled by someone more experienced

c the behaviour of an empty structure is compiler dependent versus where it is part of the spec a class with an empty sequence of members and base class objects is an empty complete objects and member subobjects of an empty class type shall have nonzero c it is rather more murky since the c99 standard has some language which implies that truly empty structures allowed but many compilers do allow it this is compiler dependent it is unlikely that you will get truly portable code in this as such non portable ways to suppress the warning may be your best vs you would use gcc from you have	
	
c89 which you must be using based on this requires the variables to be declared before you start executing statements in any be having this problem with extension files because the compiler will be treating these as which have the same assert statement is code so you declare a variable after that the same you could do int y 2 return i advise

came across a few months ago while working my way through some and was to say the for every 20 line python solution i be a gobsmacking 20 j solution that ran in a tenth of the been keen to learn some basic and have made a few attempts at picking up the but have found the learning curve to be quite those who are familiar with these would you recommend investing some time to learn one thinking j in i would do so more for the purpose of satisfying my curiosity than for career advancement or some such personal circumstances to if you care love and use it daily in my work a mathematician for a but to be honest i really feel limited by the tools that i use python so i use that have no particular desire to work in the finance which seems to be the main port of call for k users at plus i should really learn as a next language as the primary language where i so practically j almost definitely be the next language i reasonably familiar with matlab so using an programming language constitute a tremendous paradigm advice from those familiar with these languages would be much anybody recommend learning

can also research something called preauthentication is sending the first request with an authentication header as opposed to sending an inital anonymous applications and web services are ideal for this since you typically know beforehand whether authentication is you typically know if a web site requires authentication is a special but not issue with preauthentication is that you are potentially sending information to a site that you necessarily basic authentication would give away the keys to the kingdom in plain however ntlm and digest so can take a look on preauthenticating in for a web which i have used successfully eliminate the initial

can be no real right or wrong is something that is purely subjective and relates completely to the community you are working if fxcop and stylecop and the code that you regularly encounter is using then use if it is using something then use whatever that first priority should probably be to be consistent to the pattern in your own code and then consistent with your this particular reflector shows a lot of code using filename so i would go with that pattern you were in the java world and running pmd and checkstyle and their apis made frequent use of then i would go with addition to the wikipedia naming there is also practice of by kernighan and the first chapter in it touches on a lot of naming and code consistency

can configure sites in iis to require a cert but that would generate an error if someone visiting with https and require all pages to use you could put a filter on iis that checks all requests and redirects them as https calls if they are on your encryption the obvious drawback here is the need to update your list of pages every time a new page is added from an xml file or and restart the think that you are probably correct in building code into the pages that require https that redirects to an https version if they arrive via as far as your cert error you could redirect with a full path includes the instead of a relative path to fix this if you have any questions about how to detect whether the call uses https or how to get the full path of the current request please let me both are pretty straightforward but got sample code if you need the certs that handle multiple subdomains are called wildcard the problem is that they are quite a bit more expensive than standard one other thing to consider is to use a master page or derived class for the pages that need that instead of duplicating the code in each page you can just declare it as type sslpage use the corresponding master and have the class handle the need to do some url processing if you take this approach but it is pretty

can convert the pointer to uint8 t using just a it actually convert the array to a sequence of even if you sent the private storage of the array over the the contents of the array are just memory addresses to other the memory addresses in your process are almost certainly not the same in the receiving assuming that the receiving process is running cocoa and would be expecting an need to serialize the contents to some external representation that the receiver will be able to you can do that by to a creating an and its or assembling a representation by not with a cast how to get the length of bytes of the array a series of an as it have only an the count of objects in you need a series of bytes before you can get the i have to save the array to a file and read it out as need to get an external representation of the preferably in an nsdata telling it to write plist itself to a file and reading the file back in is one but there are much better which i listed

can imagine a couple possible in and are both actually if you choose to provide custom allocation behavior for an object by overloading these you must be very careful in doing so to ensure you introduce some types of objects require that you overload to avoid memory management for if you have a reference counting smart pointer object the boost you must implement and you must be sure to do so consider this broken refcountedptr mdata return t implementation here is broken because it manage the reference counts on and it does not decrement the reference count on leading to a and it does not increment the reference count on leading to a possible memory fault down the road because the object being pointed to could be deleted before all the actual references are that if you do not explicitly declare your own for your the compiler will provide a default implementation which has behavior identical to the implementation shown here that completely broken for this particular as the article says in some cases you must overload and you must be careful to handle all situations i realize that the reference was an online rather than a even after reading the full article not clear what was but i think eckel was probably referring to situations like the second one i described

code you posted appears to be ok need to give more detail if you want the problem if you run the program in a it should be able to tell you exactly which line of code is causing the exception may have to look in a call or simply step through the program until it for the confusion about whether vector can be treated as a c it definitely can by getting the address of the first element if the vector contains standard says this about in elements of a vector are stored meaning that if is a where is some type other than then it obeys the identity for all n that this was not explicitly stated in the standard was still the also herb that cannot be treated as a c array it a special case since the elements in are not stored as	
	
code you posted assumes that the square matches the is that by assume your class has implemented a method quick and provides a good did say you have a good idea how many items save a little bit of time by the that if you know you have more than 100 items that you can retval new will avoid having to grow the dictionary and you can also do the same thing with your it to some reasonable maximum size to avoid resizing you say that the grid is pretty small it seems reasonable to just allocate the stack and the dictionary to the grid if easy to only talking references so memory a concern unless your grid becomes very a check to see if an item is in the dictionary before you do the push speed it up a it depends on the relative speed of a dictionary lookup as opposed to the overhead of having a duplicate item in the might be worth it to give this a although be surprised if it made a big if really stretching on this last you have that cast in your inner i know that the compiler sometimes generates a surprising amount of code for a seemingly simple and i know if that gets optimized away by the jit you could remove that cast from your inner loop by creating a local variable of the enum type and assigning it the value of matchtype your inner loop comparison which might shave some probably get better performance by modifying your algorithm slightly to avoid processing any item more than as it items that do match can end up in the stack multiple and items that match can be processed multiple since already using a dictionary to keep track of items that do you can keep track of the items by giving them a value of then at the end you simply create a of those items that have a public static model square curstack new retval new int nummatch while square curitem foreach s in if if linq makes this but since using matches new foreach kvp in if return

controller convention is so routing can easily find the controller without additional adding the required controller ending makes it less likely that you would accidentally expose an object through mvc is a built in convention for views as by default views should be in a folder named for your controller and be named the same as the action calling this is what enables the method call in your action to work without specifying the i often find myself specifying the view but if you are looking for a convention this is definitely the one encouraged by the a model standpoint you are there is no standard the reason for this is because the mvc framework never directly touches the it needs a convention for the controllers to find them from and it needs a convention for views to find them from the but models are only accessed from logic in the controller so the framework need to know about being said i have seen most people build their models just like they built their entities or domain model before if you are using an active record pattern then name the models to correspond with the tables they are mapped if you are focusing more on a domain then name the models to correspond with the part of the domain they are i have seen more and more people creating a set of view models that are just used for presenting data to the ui and are created by pulling in parts from various models in your models are definitely the least opinionated part of but that is a good thing imo since people have very different ways they like to work in this

cost of memory allocation is generally much lower in a garbage collected memory then when just using new or malloc explicitly because garbage collectors generally this explicit memory models may also do this memory pools or memory making the cost of memory allocation equivalent to a pointer and pointed managed languages tend to out perform unmanaged languages in the general after pushing the unmanaged language can and will eventually beat the same thing is also evident in the language because even though tends to rank higher than java most of the often see implementations jumping trough various hoops as object to achieve optimal garbage collected tend to have easier to follow and more straight forward implementations because the gc is better at allocating chunks performance the biggest difference when it comes to gc vs arguably the deterministic finalization of reference languages that is the biggest argument for explicit memory management because this is generally used for purposes other than memory management as releasing closing file or window handles et however introduced the using idisposable construct to do exactly problem with garbage collection is that the systems they use tend to be rather complex to prevent memory this also makes it way more difficult to debug and track down once you do have a memory leak even garbage collected languages can have memory the flip the garbage collected language can do the most optimal thing at the most optimal time without having to burden the developer with that this means that developing for a gc language might be more so you can focus more on the

could be but it seems to me that coming from the wrong are two distinct issues you need to making sure that the propertygrid is only ever accessed on the ui if any of its methods property are accessed from other suffer pain in mysterious the exceptions are and of making sure your search thread can run solve the first make sure your objects are never modified by the ui make all of your event triggers thread aware so that your objects events as are only ever triggered on the ui second problem is easier as long as your search thread only reads from your core everything should work your search thread might inadvertently see some partially updated but is that really an couple of final thoughts implement your search to iterate through the propertygrid obtain a list of the objects up front need to be and work through that you considered using idle processing to do the the object fires an event every time the application runs out of messages to process you could hook into this and perform 1 step of your search each time the event is kind of a but with none of the used this to very good effect in the if i recall propertygrid respects the calling as soon as you start modifying a and when you move to a different you could leverage this to prevent your search thread from seeing incomplete following discovered what you already knew that propertygrid respect the ieditableobject do have another suggestion though it might be more work than you want to the time when the namespace was introduced in i saw an article on using the ambient transaction to provide for the idea is that your object properties have dual first you have the committed visible to all and you have a variable used to store uncommitted values on a when a property is the object enlists in any ambient transaction by storing the new value in the thread when the transaction commits or rolls the value for the thread is either stored or i find the original though it seems that csla provides this hope this

could be the way you are applying the datacontext to the in everytime you navigate to a page everything gets constructor gets loaded so if you are setting your datacontext inside your view you will no doubt be blowing away that selecteditem that the user in order to avoid that use the keepalive property of your will result in only the loaded event being fired when navigating back to a page you have already so you will need to ensure that you are setting the datacontext on initialize externally or within the rather than this will only work for that instance of the if you navigate to a new instance of that page it constructor will be called

could bet that the compiler is not going to honor your say that you have a local and that you recursively call the function 100 if it were to honor all your auto variables keyword it would require 100 hardware registers just for that variable the variables are alive at the 100th is a difficult analyze where is the program really spending time and try to optimize but be some decisions can end in no some can end up in worse as it has been mentioned compilers are really good at what they forcing a variable into a register means one less register for the rest of the variables to

could check a well known type for size 4 for a 32 bit sizeof is known at compiletime i believe do the the comments are you need to use a regular you are using you could create templated code and let the compiler choose the specialization for you based on the you build for a 32 bit platform the compiler would only instantiate the code for the 32 bit you build for a 654 bit platform the compiler would only instantiate the code for the 64 bit

could i send additional view parameters after i have done a redirect say i have an edit action which will redirect the user to an error action handler and i would like to be able to send detailed error messages to its to illustrate it the flow would the edit view the user submits something a fail check triggers a redirect to my error handler that my url would read like takes a view variable to display the custom error and needs a means to pass in some value to that view quick code snippet would probably look function upon i need to be able to do something or even other better ways of achieving is greatly is it possible to send view variables after a	
	
could implement it similarly to how you have but with a list subclass that calls before attempting to access an you want to do this on every but you can optimize this by setting a callback on the weak reference to mark the list dirty when something then you only need to flush the list when something has died since the last a list class implemented using this that not tested and some methods implemented very efficiently those which just convert to a real list and call the method on but it should be a reasonable starting def for x in def def for x in if is not def if return def for ref in obj if obj is not yield def return def if return def if for x in def del def def return def for x in def return def def if del return def if ensure all for x in if x del def def if if key is not key lambda key def l return def return def return obj in def return def return add a more complete list

could produce a hash based on the file contents there are two good reasons to do you to never store the same file twice for if you have two copies of a music file which are identical in content you could check to see if you have already stored that and just store it separate name is just meta from the so you would have a storage system which is indexed by the hash of the file and you then associate the file with that hash lookup risk of finding two files that compute the same hash that indeed the same depending on the size of the hash would be and you can effectively mitigate that by perhaps hashing the file in chunks could then lead to some interesting storage optimisation scenarios

could use some of the features in the commons it at least provides type access to your are only conventions in the traditional java properties some seen include like you an example properties another is to provide the default configuration with all the but commented you really want to require maybe not looking for a properties you could use an xml configuration file and specify a schema with datatypes and you can use jaxb to compile the schema into java and read it i that with validation you can make sure the required properties are best you could hope for is when you execute your it and validates the properties in the if you absolutely had to stay properties based and want to go but needed this you could have a secondary properties file that listed each property that could be its and whether it was then have to write a properties file validator that would take in a file to validate as well as a validation properties something of required properties and their looked through all of the apache configuration but they often have useful utilities like i be surprised if you could find something in there that would simplify

couple of i have refrained myself from studies and have been focusing on this is this grid which constitutes a square of 100 available places to the aim is to start from a corner and traverse through all the places with respect to some simple and reach number 100 99 if a programmer and start with 0 instead rules for traversing two spaces hop along the vertical and horizontal one space hop along the you can visit each square only visualise here is a valid example traverse to the 8th i have been working on this puzzle out of for i have tried to solve it by hand from time to but i have never gone beyond sounds try yourself and see for yourself in order to solve the i have developed a short 100 lines of program in i am a beginner in this language i wanted to see what i can program simply applies exhaustive try error solving in other brute force depth first question arises from here the unfortunately cannot solve the problem because the state space is so big that search never ends withouh ever finding a it can go up to number 98 prints without much nonetheless not a complete program also prints out the length of the search tree it has covered so in a couple of the traverse list 65th element is covered till the for just one single this number decreases in exponentially increasing time i have run the code for quite some time and could not get beyond 50 barrier and now i am seems that this simple approach will not be enough unless i run it for how can i improve my code to be faster and more efficient so that it comes up with i am looking forward to see ideas on how and exploit specific to this to overcome finally realize into a substantial in to dave webb for relating the problem to domain it is very similar to the tour problem which relates moving knight around a chess board revisiting the same the same problem but different the square

creating my chess engine i originally went with the however recently i changed my code to represent the chess board using a 64 item i found that this implementation was about more at least in my of the things you want to consider when doing the approach is describing for example if you wish to describe a valid move for a chess you will need 2 bytes to do while with the item array you can do it with one convert from a position on the item board to a board you can simply use the following i found that you never have to do that during the recursive move searching which is performance more information on building a chess feel free to visit my blog that describes the process from

decide if 1 or 2 is fix for strange if return ugly if return elseif return elseif return elseif return elseif return elseif return elseif return elseif return else nothing so both are just return one of return step is the absolutley best solution foreach as if take it and ignore the return step no best prepare image widths so we have to get them more than foreach as step filter based on the index is because we have an array of arrays return should work test but it is does it we look for the absolutely best in this because looking for a substrings is inexpensive we find a image we have to analyze the image widths so we calls a filtering function that takes 2 array values and replaces those two by the one return by the function better this is repeated until there is only one value left in the solution is still because comparisons if are done more than my notation skills are a bit but i think soulmerges solution is the better one could still improve soulmerges because the second loop is not pack it into a function so you have return as a if the first strstr return the value and ignore the you have to store the score for every array just compare to the highestkey variable and if the new value is store foreach as if return else if 260 elseif 265 elseif 600 elseif 220 elseif the loser return should work in imagine a more efficient way

decided that there is no guaranteed way to do the solution that i present below works for english version but fails when compiling with japanese version vc2003 perhaps it is japanese in any it cannot be depended on to note that even declaring everything as strings work is painful in gcc as described i believe that you just need to bite the bullet and move all text into a data file and load it from i am now storing and accessing the text in ini files via at least there is a guarantee that it works as all text is out of the answering this myself since only evan appeared to understand the the answers regarding what unicode is and how to use are not relevant for this problem as this is not about nor a misunderstanding of character i appreciate your attempt to help apologies if i clear problem is that i have source files that need to be under a variety of platforms and the program does it care about any other i want to have string literals in like currently works with gcc and how do i do it with backward compatible is what i have literals are used as is encoded source files must not have a literals are used as is encoded source files may or may not have a bom literals are massaged by the compiler raw string literals are to a specified is not supported as a target files must have a the simple answer is that for this particular is broken and does not supply a backward compatible compile the only way to get unicode strings into the compiled program is via bom wchar which means that i need to convert all strings back to at time of any simple method of converting wchar to for what size and encoding is the wchar on on other it see the for some the end i decided that i will avoid the conversion cost on all compilers other than with source like the visual 2005 and later require the source files in and all strings to be encoded as otherwise the strings will be converted into the local multibyte encoding and cause to use a as these strings then need to be convert back to this function is just a rough example of how to do define char static char return visual 2003 and gcc will use the string literals as so the files should be saved as gcc requires the files to not have a define that this code is just a simplified production use would need to clean it up in a variety of ways error buffer size is used like the following it compiles cleanly and works correctly in my tests on and

depends on what kind of project working and what if need to interact with your for often uses capistrano to and capistrano makes certain assumptions about what your directory structure will look like relative to the root of your in this if you have several interrelated rails you need to use each app gets its own and then you have a larger repository that manages each of the independent repositories as if you have tools that make these kind of good repository design requires that you break things up a bit if even the slightest possibility that some day you might want to use a subsection of a larger project or reuse some large swath of code within some independent out some subsection of a repository as its own separate entity while maintaining version history is difficult in and so a good idea to plan for your specific call that a perfect example of where a couple submodules would be with regard to sharing if for some reason actually an issue that proves you can always use a

depends what you are my blog uses blosxom in perl but a similar thing could be done for where each individual entry is a separate text the first line is plain text and the rest is unrestricted following a few simple these are rendered to form a simple but effective blogging does have drawbacks but it also means that each post is a discrete which works well for updating on a local machine and then publishing to a remote web this is limited when it comes to efficient querying so certainly not a good choice if you want control and interaction with your	
	
depends what you want to remoting is falling out of favor for true in for communication systems it would be preferable to use a service such as via is still valuable for communicating between appdomains in a that remoting available for all frameworks for silverlight support but wcf and things like http are you look toward if wcf an look at regular problems with ties client and server to ties client and server to the same binary tends to lead to poorly considered boundaries is very easy to leak the wrong objects over the which can lead to big latency remoting uses binary which is useful in some bur problematic in others above tend to be xml based other formats and are based than implementation meaning client and server can have different types representing the as long as they are similar is also possible to use binary on for provides a wcf hook to use binary format over a wcf service this is then a bespoke and need the tool at both are also other ways of talking between all of them arguably preferable over remoting if they are less versatile minimalist is a pox messages

develop and operate a blogging application in which user data a scattered across many 50 other are able to close their and their must disappear from the site right we also must be able to undelete their for a given and also to make those data available for juridic authorities for another the years and different we used different flag everywhere each table has a which is updated when data is very nasty because it slows down every list generation creates a lot of updates upon it does not handle the two stage deletion described in fact we never used this but worth it for each we create a second table with the same schema plus two extra fields the extra fields are used to know if the data is still accessible for when to delete and it was deleted in the first this version is just a bit better than the previous but can be very nasty performance wise too when tables are you have to change the schema of some tables remove unique which makes the system harder to for new administrators and mentally healthy people in same approach as but we move data on a different database which allows to browse those data without impacting the for this the uniqueness constraint is done at the java so all the schemas are the the double data retention constraint is done by having a dedicated db for each which makes things have to admit that none of those approaches satisfies even if they can work up to a certain amount of i have also imagined that we could just delete some key rows in the and let the rest inconsistent scheduled for a more controlled deletion but it scares me you know other ways of doing the same keeping the same level of features could align the two durations to simplify the not looking a solution for my existing but would like to improve the next input will be highly appreciated to efficiently unpublish all datas from a particular user on a blogging

do writing your own crypto system can easily lead to making best to use an existing or if get someone who knows cryptography to do if you have to do it read already have enough insecure do things correct and worry about performance if you are stuck on using aes to roll your here are a few is a block given a key and a block of it converts it to a specific the problem with this is that the same blocks of data will generate the same ciphertext with the same every so suppose you send data like two separate and the userroles encryption will have the same ciphertext each regardless of the all i need is the ciphertext for an and i can drop it right in with my there are operation the main idea is that take the ciphertext of one and xor it into the ciphertext of the next that way do and the username ciphertext is affected by the problem is that the first block is still vulnerable just by seeing i might know their enter the the iv the cipher and ensures it has random data to encrypt the rest of the so now the userroles ciphertext has the ciphertext of the random iv problem make sure you generate a random iv for each the iv is not sensitive and can be sent plaintext with the use an iv large enough the size of the block should be fine for many provide integrity anyone can modify your and the decrypt will still unlikely be data in but it might be hard to know what valid data for if transmitting a guid be easy to modify some bits and generate a completely different that could lead to application errors and so fix there is to run a hash algorithm sha256 or on the and include that in the data you so if my message is send now if someone tampers with the ciphertext by flipping a the hash will no longer compute and you can reject the you need to generate a key from a use the this provides salting and which can improve the strength of derived keys and reduce the chance of discovering the password if the key is sorry for not mentioning this earlier you also need to make sure you have an if you simply encrypt the message and pass it anyone who gets the message can just resend to avoid you should add a timestamp to the if the timestamp is different by a certain reject the you may also want to include a id with it could be the and reject messages that come from other ips using the same important to make sure you do the hash verification when you include the timing someone could tamper with a bit of the ciphertext and potentially generate a valid timestamp if you detect such brute force apparently using an iv correctly is controversial for some some code generate random ivs and add them to your output for also perform the authentication making sure the encrypted data aesdemo const int encryption with random iv to and includes hash of plaintext for public static construct message with var msg new var hash using aes using enc var encbytes prepend iv to var res new return public static using aes var iv new probably could copy right to the byte but not using dec var decbytes verify var hash var existinghash new if throw new hash hash is var res new return static bool if return for i i if return return static aes salt may not be needed if password is if throw new must be at least 8 if throw new must be at least 8 var pdb new var key var aes return static int int using sha return public static void var password var salt new 0 var ct1 var ct2 var pt1 var pt2 now check try tamper detection catch tampering performact1 performact2 tampering message hash 46 at removing the random iv and the the type of how the first corresponding to is the without a simple example of passing a just encrypt and open to in the attack is easily even with cbc static void var buff new new var v var aes var encbytes var dec for i i for x x try catch 6598637501946607785 if the kind of id it could quite easily be changed to another you need to authenticate outside of your the message structure is unlikely to fall into place and can sorta act as a but why rely on something that could possibly you need to be able to rely on your crypto working correctly regardless of the

does sounds like fragmentation is caused by you allocating objects on the then deleting some now have a hole in the memory that is if you allocate another object too big for the the hole will remain eventually with enough memory you can end up with so many holes that they waste you way around this is to try and decide your memory requirements up if got particular objects that you know you are creating many try and ensure the same can use a pool to make the allocations more efficient for a particular or at least let you track it better so you can understand going on and come up with a good way of doing this is to create a single bool byte need to tune the value 20 to what your program need to pick a good pool size the pool up front when your program starts and it so that it is as big as the maximum requirements for your you may want to heapalloc it the equivalent in your os so that you can control when it appears from somewhere in you application override the new and delete operators for a suspect class so that they return slots from this your objects will be stored in this can override new and delete for classes of the same size to be put in this pools of different sizes for different go for the worst offenders at done something like this before and it solved my problem on an embedded i also was using a lot of so i created a custom allocator for stl custom allocator there are loads of this was useful for records stored in a my program

enables us to also configure file thus besides iis also invokes when requests have the following file extension is used to request user user controls be accessed how and why would anyone send a request to a user this extension is used for http but why would you want to request an page directly instead of registering this handler inside configuration file and enable it to be called when files with certain non ashx extensions are since there can be several http handlers how will know which handler to invoke if they all use ashx what does the requested ashx file perhaps a definition of a http handler i know how we register http handlers to be invoked when pages are but how do we register http handler for ashx this extension is used to request a global application why would we ever want to call i assume that when request is made for an object derived from httpapplication class is except this time no web page processing takes besides being able to request for is there any other reason why i would choose to request file with extension ashx files have to be they are basically a simpler for when you need the entire page life a common use is for retrieving dynamic images from a if i write a http i should put it in a file with extension and will build an httphandler object similarly to how it builds a page instance from if a hacker did try to make a request for one of these what would you want to you certainly want iis to treat it like a text file and send the source for your app down to the could do the same it does with file it registers these file types with iis so that it can explicitly prevent users from accessing these because you expect requests from the browser for a it mean you want that resource handled by the these extensions are also how picks up files to compile for the web site model then why also allow files to be directly and as far as i am these are not exposed to process any external book claims the two are mapped in appreciate your the extention is defined in a config file just not the its in the use the difference is that the class that handles a reads the page directive in the file to map the request to a class specified in that this saves you from having to put an explicit path in the for every handler that you which could result in a very long thought http handler class was defined inside but instead file with extension only contains page not sure if i understand this say we have ten http handlers we want to invoke by making a request to i assume for each http handler there will be specific file thus if request is made for then handler specified inside that file will be another must confess that still a bit unsure about ashx realize that by using it we can for example create where page directive will tell which class http to invoke when request is made for thus no need to register http handler in if you use http handlers that then they will only get invoked when requests are made for files with if i want http handler to be invoked for files with other such as then i will still need to register http handler in file mappings

experience is that in situations where you need a of the and types of fields are so flexible and likely to change throughout the lifetime of your project that you would likely need some sort of map instead of example have an attribute map from keys to public calls for getting and setting the but let everybody use them make sure they create classes to represent each attribute you are interested and that class provides all the functions for manipulating that for if you have you could have a class that is initialized to a specific player and then provides setters with appropriate validation and and perhaps things like calculating strength with advantage of this is that you decouple the use of your attributes from your player so if you now add an intelligence you have to deal and recompile everything that manipulates only for accessing fields a bad when you access a field in vb least in old you usually call a property getter and setter and vb simply hides the call for my view is that you have to adapt to the conventions of the language that you are in java and the like you have fields and you have calling a method should always have the to make it clear that it is a call and other things may happen you could get an either one of the benefits of java is its more precise syntax and to java or is like texting to graduate school scientific some usability research shows that better to not have parameters to constructors and rather construct and call all the setters if you need

expressions allow you to write a custom machine in a compact to process a string of there are at least two reasons why using regular expressions is software development involves a lot of paper and careful regular expressions fit into this model very because to write an effective expression properly involves a lot of staring at visualizing the paths of the software developers would much rather hammer out and use a debugger to step through to see if the code is regular expressions do not support this working style very one of a regular expression is effectively an atomic hard to observe stepwise execution in a too easy to write a regular expression that accidentally accepts more input than you the value of a regular expression really to match valid to to match invalid techniques to do for regular expressions are not very or at least not widely goes to the point of regular expressions being hard to just by looking at a regular it takes a lot of concentration to visualize all possible inputs that should be but are mistakenly ever try to debug someone regular expression a resistance to using regular expressions among software developers i think chiefly due to these two

feminella got it but i think there is more to entropy is based on and probability is always in the eye of the said that 1 and 0 were equally likely if that is then the string of 100 1s followed by 100 0s has a probability of of which is 200 as you the entropy of that string shannon is its information content times its or 200 still a really small is important because if you do coding to compress the in the case of this string it will get a small but averaged over all it will not do with it will average out to about but not the other if you look at your original string and say it is so striking that whoever generated it is likely to generate more like then you are really saying its probability is larger than so you are making a different assumptions about the original probability structure of the generator of the namely that it has lower entropy than 200 i find this subject really especially when you look into kolmogorov in that you define the information content of a string as the length of the smallest program that could generate this leads to all sorts of insights into software engineering and language hope that and thanks for your

file with a other answers have the easiest method is to create a lock file in the same directory as the you want to be able to access the same file over multiple pc the best solution i can think of is to just include the identifier of the machine currently writing to the data the sequence for writing to the data file would if there is a lock file present there is a lock see if the one owning it by checking that its content has my the just write to the data file then delete the lock not the just wait a second or a small random length of time and try the whole cycle there is no lock create one with my identifier and try the whole cycle again to avoid race condition that the lock file is really with the i would record a timestamp in the lock file and check whether older than a given timeout the timestamp is too then assume that the lock file is stale and just delete it as it would mea one of the pc writing to the data file may have crashed or its connection may have been you are in control the format of the data could be to reserve a structure at the beginning of the file to record whether it is locked or you just reserve a byte for this you could for that would mean the data file and that other values would represent the identifier of the machine currently writing to with adding a few things because jiri klouda correctly pointed out that uses that will result in the actual lock file being in an undetermined few ways to solve this the nfs directory with the or this is easy but completely guarantee data consistency between client and server though so there may still be issues although in your case it may be the lock file or data file using the the or this is supposed to disable caching will lower performance but will ensure be able to use to lock the data file but its implementation is spotty and you will need to check if your particular os actually uses the nfs locking it may do nothing at all the data file is then another client opening it for writing will and it seem to work on smb so probably best to just forget about use nfs and just use samba there is a article on the and why nfs is probably not the best answer to your usage will also find in this article various methods for locking solution is also a good if you want to keep things use nfs for files that are shared amongst multiple a small database server to save your data into and bypass the locking issues altogether or keep your current multiple data files system and just write a small utility to concatenate the may still be the safest and simplest solution to your

for know that a ref parameter in passes a to a allowing the external variable itself to be changed within a called but is the reference handled much like a c pointer the current contents of the original variable with every access to that parameter and changing the original variable with every modification to the or can the called method rely on a consistent reference for the duration of the the former brings up some thread safety in written a static method in which passes an object by static void definition caller provides a completed but and after some consistency checking we the definition they if there is already a definition with the same it register the new one and instead their reference is updated to the for that want this to be rigorously but a pathological scenario comes to suppose the client our shares the reference in an such as using a static member rather than a local static definition riskyreference one thread sets new fills out the and calls our while another thread also decides to set new are we guaranteed that in our register method the reference handling will not be modified on us by other threads the reference to the object was copied in and will be copied out when we or can that other thread replace the object on us in the middle of our execution referencing a pointer to the original storage and thus break our that this is different from changes to the underlying object which are of course possible for a reference type but can be easily guarded against by appropriate locking within that we guard changes to an external variable space we would have to make our own copy of the parameter at the top of the method and overwrite the parameter at the bottom but that would seem to make more sense for the compiler to do for us given the insanity of handling an unsafe tend to think that the reference may be copied in and copied out by the compiler so that the method is handling a consistent reference to the original object it changes its own reference when it wants regardless of what might be happening to the original location on other but having trouble finding a definitive answer on that point in documenation and discussion of ref anyone assuage my concern with a definitive for confirmed it with a code example and thinking about it it makes sense that it is indeed the behavior which i was worred one point of is to pass large structs by reference rather than copy another reason is that you might to set up a monitoring of a variable and need to pass a reference to it which will see changes to the variable changing between null and a live which an automatic would not allow to make our method robust against client we could implement it static void definition definition thedefinition copy sanity actual changing thedefinition to a new definition newdefinition copy still have their own threading issues as far as what they end up but at least their insanity break our own process and possibly slip a bad state past our ref parameters or vulnerable to unsafe multithreaded

functor approach is the nicest one to my mind just a shame that java have a nicer way of representing closures or basically what and in many other it would be can cut down on the physical bloat somewhat by using something functors new new public void new public void whitespace collapsing here may well be against the style guide but i think it makes the code easier to actually in that you can see the meat more start lobbying for closures in java 8	
	
future to the blog post i sent how mysql works with key you provide algorithm just creates a 16 buffer set to all then loops through all the characters of string you provide and does an assignment with bitwise or between two if we iterate until hit the end of the 16 byte just start over from the doing for strings shorter than we stop at the end of know if you can read but the mentioned this set initial key sptr if just loop over until we used all key i came up with this method a help from rob from ruby do given a string returns the key mysql uses when encrypting and so all you need now use openssl built into and then you can make the two complete code can be found in this	
	
gac is really just a directory on your machine like any the typical maybe some each of those find subfolders where the actual are first need to write a recursive method to get you all the found under can find these online easily if not comfortable doing it once you have that list of you can proceed to use to load up the assembly and check all the types to see if they implement a given only suggestion would be to load up these in a seperate appdomain so that not allowing any potential harmful to get loaded into your assemblies and checking for a given new

gc is incredibly an unpredictable gc is not suitable for certain one such example would be hard real time in a hard real time system a single unexpected delay can result in mission of such hard real time system would fly by wire systems on a fighter navigation systems on a robotic arms that perform getting killed in a real time video game is also a mission you want to gc right at the moment the player pressed the the giant fireball that will kill my character and force me to redo the 20 minute long that is a very important it has been noted that in os you cannot control the task priority which could easily be worse than a large gc static static polymorphism could go beyond and it is a very useful generics as implemented in java is still dynamic and it loses that opportunity to eliminate type checking where compile time type checking would is of course is possible for increased code size to reduce performance more so than dynamic types as with all optimizations it should be is in a nit there are times when you just want a currently in java you must put such functions in a class as a static a better solution would be a function in a while a class can work like a classes cannot span multiple files and

general the copyright owner can choose how work is the copyright owner of the work can choose to release it under a commercial license then open source it the copyright owner may take an apache licensed work and it under gpl v3 without any what they do however is prevent people who obtained the work under apache license terms from forking the code and continuing to use an apache licensed version same applies for the question then you your own the copyright on the apache licensed there are a number of possible hold copyright on the entire then you may freely relicense the hold copyright on parts of the work and the other copyright holders are willing assign their copyright to if all of the copyright holders assign their rights to you then own the entire work and free to relicense hold copyright on parts of the work and the other copyright holders are willing to allow if all of the other copyright holders then collectively you can relicense the entire hold copyright on parts of the work and the other copyright holders are not willing to assign their copyright or in this you may remove the portions of the work you own and replace with a fresh implementation that you hold copyright do not own copyright on the entire the apache v2 license does not require you to assign copyright to a third party and explicitly states that it does not limit your ability to distribute the work under additional or different license so this is work completed under a contributor license agreement may result in this the apache v2 license does not forbid relicensing of a work by if you own the work in its entirety nothing to stop you from relicensing if you only partially own the you will need to seek agreement from the other copyright holders before you can relicense	
	
generally only refactor if i see a immediate problem with the when i need to implement a new feature or fix a i find that the current structure of the code makes this such many places to change because of data hardcoded that need to too big to i will sometimes see code that seems problematic and which like to but i resist the urge if the area is not currently being worked see refactoring as a balance between the and doing things which do not really generate any immediate therefore i would not normally refactor unless i see a concrete like to hear about experiences from people who refactor as a matter of how do you stop yourself from polishing so much you lose time for important

go two links trying to explain you how things i will try to explain it as shortly as i most of what happens inside a windows forms application happens in a single usually the same thread runs if you open you will see that has a line that looks like the you debug the application at any moment and examine the call you will see it will trace back to that run this means that a windows forms application is in fact a continuous run of the run what is run run is eating a message queue through which windows sends messages to run then dispatches those messages to the correct which themselves do things like add text which corresponds to the key being redraw notice that all this happens during and endless loop running alongside a single so weather you are typing or simply moving the window loads of those messages are being passed onto the which in turn is processing them and reacting all in that single controls can also send messages to themselves through the queue and even you can place messages in the pump via one of the things those controls do is to raise events according to what if you click a the code written to handle that click will ultimately and indirectly be run by the what is happening with your code is that even though you are changing the visible status of your progress bar to visible and then updating its you are then changing its visibility to all in the same this means that only after you leave the will be able to continue iterating and consuming the message effectively asking the progress bar to update its when that already left the progress visibility to the last thing you did before exiting the is a quick and dirty workaround to your problem as it reads the messages in the queue and processes i really feel comfortable using it as it can bring reentrancy threads is a good but i would recommend using a threadpool thread instead of a custom thread in this kind of as i tend to use custom threads only in cases where i have a limited number of long lived threads and i need to control their life the easiest and most practical way to use threads is to use the backgroundworker even though i would recommend going through the pains of understanding how to do windows forms multithreading with delegates if you want to really understand what is going

going to have to give us some more detail about the exact structure of your data and filters to really be able to help you are the filters being used to select a subset of or to modify the what are the filters there are a few general less is there some way you can limit the amount of data working some that can run quickly and cut it down before you do your main out of the inner loop as soon as if one of the filters rejects a then break out of the inner loop and move on to the next if this is then you should also try to make the most selective filters come is assuming that your filters are being used to reject items out of the rather than modify for in the computation the filters if each of them performs some complicated calculations that share some then perhaps or may be used to avoid redundant it all boils down to the first less at all three levels of your can you do less work by limiting the items in the outer do less work by stopping after a particular filter and doing the most selective filters do less work by not doing any redundant computation inside of each

goodness not the only know of a library that handles but i can personally vouch for your profiling i once implemented a progress bar which was used to report the progress of a complicated file operation small files were being and then combined into a larger i had the software keep track of the time it took for writes and and then adjusted the progress bar after the program had been run a couple of the progress bar would move as smooth as no pauses and no fast works as long as the time taken for your operations are easily i would be leery of using this method on something like a download progress since the speed of the network is completely

great about mvc is that is try to hide how http to fully understand mvc you need to understand the technologies of the webforms are adequate as long as you work to their ultimately a very leaky abstraction when you while the drawbacks of viewstate have been well discussed by this point i think the extremely unwise attempt to mimic the behaviour of winforms that is the underlying flaw viewstate is merely a product of web controls which ship with also leave a of lot to be desired as anyone who has tried to build an accessible website can attest the web controls show a total lack of understanding for how frontend development is and frankly are a mvc all that nonsense is done away not shielded from or javascript if you come to the party with those technologies the framework gets out of the way and lets you leverage if then thankfully it try to help you to pretend they

guess is that have a binary which is output by a fortran these can look like compressed files because they are not readable in a text allows you to write the data out to a file without formatting so that you can reload it later without having to parse the is that you need that original source code in order to see what types of variables are written in the you have no access to the fortran source but a of time to you could write some simple fortran program and guess what types of variables are being i advise as fortran is not very you want some simple source code to look at which details binary read and write in and includes a code just start by replacing with for a double precision

guido himself announced that the reverse domain convention ought to be it be unless there were significant changes to the implementation of in python searches an import path at with a java searches a path with an exhaustive algorithm both at and go try arranging your directories like import import one of those statements will because either or comes higher on the search when python sees it grabs the first package it if that happens to contain then the first will if it throws an and gives because must occur at potentially at any point in the flow of the code most often at the nobody wants an exhaustive at that point to verify that no possible it assumes that if it finds a package named it is python distinguish between the following com import import import concept of verifying that is is going to be different in each in you really only have to deal with the second and that can be accomplished by walking through the file system guess an advantage of naming classes and files the in if you tried to accomplish import with nothing but file system the first case could be transparently the same the second case could be but you would lose the initial running of but the third case is entirely the code has to execute for to be and this is another main does more than resolve it executes you get away with this if every python package ever distributed required an installation process that searched for the and then the and so on and so but this makes packaging considerably destroys and makes packaging and

had a geek fight with someone over what the strategy pattern really is and i need a little expert help definitive both agree that the strategy pattern allows for the guts of a class the to be swapped out at runtime while maintaining the same her contention is that to be a you would have to get the same my contention is that swapping an or logic of a class could mean that the results of the overridden operation are but that it still meets the intent of the strategy code example with your any subclasses of a class would be a they have the same method definitions and are therefore a int int temp i temp b int int temp i temp c int int temp i temp a one is not first two are because for any input they will give you the exact same the last one is just because it gives you an int does not make it a they have to the same use a abstraction term just to make them a all do but they are not all doing the thing in a different that is the essence of a the real strategy design pattern please stand

had a who was trying to outwit our c optimizer and routine rewrote code that only he could one of his favorite tricks was changing a readable method like up some int int if return if return a long expression here return return 0 input 1 a long expression a long expression a long expression the first line of a method would become and all other logic would be replace by deeply nested terniary when you tried to argue about how this was he would point to the fact that the assembly output of his method was three or four assembly instructions it necessarily any but it was always a bit this was an embedded system where memory usage occasionally did but there were far easier optimizations that could have been made than this that would have left the code after for some reason he decided that was too so he started changing all of these into on the theory that it was more readable and faster as readable code into unreadable code for at the most a and sometimes actually slower

had network issues causing corruption in an access database on our shared drive and i spent a lot of time cleaning up corrupted rows from a couple specific memo fields in particular were a good indication of corruption because they are not stored inline like the rest of the data but are kept in a separate i could open up the corrupted table in datasheet mode and try to determine which rows were corrupted by putting the focus on a corrupted memo there was corruption then i would immediately get an int and date columns would have odd values but would not actually throw any errors when i read their is why cycling through all records and fields in the database as shown in the vba from a previous answer makes some sense but will perform most reliably only if you have memo field	
	
had similar problem with much more tables we can indeed avoid making cursor for each rows to be the only cursor is for looping the list of the table names we are also going to need dynamic sql for the whole operation is extremely compared to the traditional cursor loop trick is to insert the relevant rows into the same and then update its fk column to its how we can collect the mass is by making use of keyword during the and save them into a temporary table later we join with the tables involved for updating the their know table tbl id refid invoicedetail into price from invoicedetail custid 808 denormalized original populate temporary table with a list of newly created auto running our job is just to make this insert query as only drawback of this method is that we need on each table we must key of its own by the name of in this case we need to to become to become and a new column int primary in denormalized for tables listed with the table will require the current front end application to populate this new helper an will make our work a bit more column called defined int this column is for making the relationship of rows belong to as a copy of list all table names into table tbl sysname primary fktbl fkcol depth select select select love to go abstract as to just populating column during insertion and dynamically populate the rest of the columns by updating them with the result of recursive cte of however that could be beside the assume we have a table with the list of table names ordered by the way it should be loop the table in a int 808 original custid to copy tbl from where fktbl is dbcursor cursor local for select depth from order by dbcursor next from dbcursor into 0 set case when 0 then else end as set set set into from where print remap if third level set set from join as rf on and where as print if 0 select id from fetch next from dbcursor into from order by from table the content of function declare set select from where and non return am sure we can further improve these scripts to be far more but for the sake of solving the this would be the minimum

happening here is indeed a lets ignore the ternary for a second and pretend that numcmp is always for the purpose of this functions can act as function pointers in so if you look at the type of numeric it is actually order for this to be properly used in qsort it needs to have void because the types here all have the same size with respect to parameters and return possible to substitute on for the all needed is a cast to make the compiler

hard to say exactly what this without more i presume working on someone code and the lines showing appear scattered across a number of best guess as to the code intent is that this is a mechanism to deal with it is common in to use libraries with your own if those libraries need to temporarily hold data that you created and you need a way to give the library access to your data even though the library know about your one example is a if a library will asynchronously notify you when an event you need to give it a function pointer and also data so that when the function is you know what to do with libraries commonly take a pointer for this it is common in to just pass in an object instance for the data and then delegate to that object to handle the what the code would look library void user ptr do something with myclass new the callback is now armed with all the data it libraries accomplish this by declaring this is a raw pointer to some memory anything could be at that an a class a the library holds onto that pointer and returns it back to your code at some 3rd line of your example code is taking the pointer and casting it to a reference to a class references are like pointers except they cannot be null and they use value syntax the operator instead of the for the 4th line of your example code then uses a method on the class if all 4 lines of code are consecutive in the code base dealing that code means that ignorant of a more compact way to do the same code in one if you prefer value	
	
hard to say without actually knowing more about your current this is what your situation sounds already have an app ready to go with all of the business logic sounds like its written in already have the services written and exposed through a rest api using some other standalone meaning that if you wanted you could access the data right now with the browser without any extra have not yet built the web but when you it will get all of its content from the rest api using xhr and i say because i would think that you would already be using some kind of framework to generate the other i am correct in my then i would say that you have no need for an additional framework springmvc my use and aid in exposing rest but the bulk of what they provide is an easy way to make an application that must generate html on the deal with form and handle sessions in a it really sound like be doing any of and it will likely make your app more you did at some point need the things that rails i would say that you may not need to use rails to expose the rest apis you have you could use rails just for what you and continue to use what you have for the rest

have a application written in a small but growing amount of it has evolved over the years with many features you would expect in a large files that make it hard to isolate testable that are too complex to be easily this code is targeted for embedded a lot of overhead to run it on the actual so we would like to do more of our development and testing in quick on a local but we would like to avoid the classic strategy of into a file on your fix if developers are going to to go the trouble to do like to be able to recreate the same tests and run in an automated our in order to refactor the code to be more we need it to be more but in order to introduce automated unit we need it to be more problem is that since our files are so we might have a function inside a file that calls a function the same that we need to stub out to make a good unit it seems like this would be less of a problem as our code gets more but that is a long way thing we thought about doing was tagging to be source code with then we could write a script scan source files for testable compile it in a separate and link it with the unit we could slowly introduce the unit tests as we fix defects and add more there is concern that maintaining this scheme with all the required stub will become too much of a and developers will stop maintaining the unit so another approach is to use a tool that automatically generates stubs for all the and link the file with only tool we have found that will do this is an expensive commercial but this approach seems to that all our code be more modular before we can even since only the external calls can be stubbed i would rather have developers think about their external dependencies and intelligently write their own but this could be overwhelming to stub out all the dependencies for a horribly line it might be difficult to convince developers that they need to maintain stubs for all their external but is that the right way to do other argument heard is that the maintainer of a subsystem should maintain the stubs for their but i wonder if developers to write their own stubs would lead to better unit of add another whole dimension to the have looked at several based unit test and there are a lot of options that look but we have not found anything to ease the transition from of code with no unit to here are my questions to anyone else who has been through is a good starting are we going in the right or are we missing something tools might be useful to help with the since our budget right now is roughly our build environment is so we use any do you introduce unit testing into a legacy

have a nsis installer that we previously built using nant scripts that copy some files around and run via a exec task to build the installer after the nant script i have the compelte structure for our cd and also our was just doing a get from sourcesafe onto an unused desktop and using it as a build compiling sometimes we would have a couple of files checked in that fix something in those cases i would go to the build and very selectively get only those to avoid getting other changed files that we ready to release basically i am able to allow development to continue and selectively include certain changed files into the installer for we no longer have a free and need to build from our so i am setting up ci factory so that the developer can kick the build off without remoting into the the one issue i am struggling is the best way to continue to allow this selective change control to the default concept of ci that ci factory implements is fine for internal development i also want to setup a ccnet project that is run only on demand via a force build for this type of is what brain stormed so without being sure how well this will if at figuring out what ccnet and ci factory are all the ccnet project would be setup such that it would get modifications would trigger a since the other ccnet project that is using the default ci call it the of getting latest when changes are then these two projects share the same working so the would need a different working so that its files get updated when the ci build is the developer would need to remote into the one selectively do a get into the working and then force a build through ci i see with this having to remote in to selectively do i have no idea how to allow a single ci factory project to have two different working copies of the product so that each project configuration block has afraid of what kind of strangeness this might not quite sure yet how to specify a source control block in ccnet project config but prevent it from doing a get latest when it still gradually figuring out what things are in scripts and can be easily taken out without breaking other versus what is not meant to be mucked around with is not would really like to hear about how others deal with this issue of selectively releasing if you have a similar i am constrained to so my immediate need is to solve this with that in but at the same time be interested in hearing how you manage this with other source control i guess you would probably have a branch that is your latest developments and then merge changes into the trunk whenever you want to release i really trust vss for and i think the branching concepts might be a little too much overhead and learning curve for this like i said stories with other source control systems would be useful future knowledge for in integration of changes with continuous

have a repository data access pattern like query members void void void the scenario where i have a repository of users have a user name which is if i create a new user with a username that exists i have a dumb ui layer that when i add it to the all is when i hit my repository attempts to save the item to the my database is enforcing these rules luckily and throws me back an aborted exception due to a unique key seems to me generally this validation is done at the layer above the the layers that call it know they should ensure this and will and execute in some kind of transaction scope to avoid but always seem possible with the medium ignorance that my repository be enforcing these what happens if my medium is such as a flat database without any integrity if the repository is validating these kind of how would they inform callers about the violation in a way that the caller can accurately identify what went exceptions seem like a poor way to handle this because their relatively expensive and are hard to specialize down to a specific been playing around with a for canadd with add will call canadd and throw an invalid operation exception if can returns a canadd also returns a list of violations about what went this way i can start to stack these routines through the for the service layer above would also have a method that would return the repositories report any additional violations it wanted to check as more complicated business such as which users can invoke specific of data is such a fundamental yet i feel there is no real guidance for how to handle more advanced validation requirements additionally in this how do you handle validation of entities that are in the repository and are updated via change for repo var user you could this will cause an going deeper down the rabbit imagine got a validation system in place when i add the and i do something like repo var newuser new so far so var otheruser this validating when adding the user was as actions could screw us up the add validation rule would need to check the actual persistence storage and any items queued up to still stop the previous change tracking so now do i start to validate the save changes it seems like there would be a huge amount of violations that could happen from aparently unrelated asking for an perfect safety in my repository enforce validity of if where and

have a robot that uses an optical mouse as a position as the robot moves it is able to track change in x and y directions using the the mouse also tracks which direction you are moving ie negative x or positive these values are summed into separate x and y the robot rotates in place and moves forward so the movement of the robot is ideally in straight lines the mouse tracking can pickup deviations if you veer at particular a particular set of movements of the robot would be rotate 45 move 3 inches rotate 90 move 10 inches rotate move 5 inches rotate 10 move 1 inch each time the mouse x and mouse y registers give the real distances you moved in each if i want to repeat the movement set going from a to d how can i do this using the information i have already i know i can basically sum all the angles and distances i feed into it but this would prove to be inaccurate if there were large errors in each movement how can i use the raw information from my a friend provided an idea that i could continuously sine and cosine the mouse values and calculate the final vector but not really sure how this would problem is that the mouse only gives relative readings so rotating or moving you are potentially erasing so what i am wondering is how you can implement the algorithm so it can continually track changes to give you a shortest path if you moved in zigzags to get there algorithm for

have a situation where my xslt files should display prices alongwith decimals depending on whether the input xml contains decimals or i can receive xml files with two types of values xml will contain all prices formatted with decimals upto two places call this one or the prices will be rounded off to the nearest integer call this one problem is that i need to refactor as little as possible in the xslt files and yet allow them to apply the transformation to xhtml in the same format as the xml in order to accomplish i implemented and suggested three guidelines to my all function calls when the value is being computed for calculations or stored in a use certain conditions apply to this rule the value is to be use the this should ensure that integer or decimal values will be displayed as originally present in the optional tags as use the function even if the value is only being this is necessary because if the tag is trying to obtain a value will give an is a illustrative example of the works for but values in rendered upto 14 decimal even though shows it correctly in the debugger in i cannot figure out special about the error works same as the above works for but values in are rendered with decimal works for but some values in rendered for is rendered as is rendered as 95 the html comments it works in most cases but not would like to use a single expression to format all prices same as the rather than applying constructs everywhere which would additionally require a boolean parameter passed to the xslt to determine the display the present state of the xslt is that all numbers are rounded off regardless of the using do i accomplish after i decided to create a sample xml the xslt so the experts can try it out xml one contains decimal formatting based on input

have a three question i have is for when the user is entering data into the formatting code when the row gets the focus changes the value field to a dropdown combobox if the testcode is of type the drop down has a list of all the system codes that have a parentsyscodeid of the when the user chooses a value in the list it translates into a number which goes into the value datatype of the field is i made it an integer instead of a string because when reporting it is easier to do calculations and sorting if it is a there are issues if you are putting value into a string as when the system was being designed they only wanted numbers in users now want to put strings into the value field as well as from a list and wondering what the best way of doing that would it be bad practice to convert the field over to a string and then store both strings and integers in the same there are different issues related to this one but not sure if any are a really big i add another column into the table of string datatype and if the test is a string type then put the data the user enters into the different option would be to create a relationship to another table and if the user types in a string into the value field it adds it into the new table with a key of a have any interesting of storing a number and text in same sql

have a web project which is migrating from classic asp to and would like to redirect requests from the old such the new a fairly long there will be classic asp pages running in parallel with with individual pages being replaced by their versions over where i want to redirect from the old pages to the new ones to keep users from receiving 404 and also to keep the accumulated pagerank on the question how would you do the redirection logic from the classic asp to the new the obvious solution is to replace with some simple vbscript that redirects to but in the long run i want to get rid of the old so i would like to implement the redirection in such a way that they will exist also after the site is completely running in option would be to map the extension to and implement the redirection as an but i guess there is no way of making the classic asp engine run after the request has been passed to to deal with link redirects when migrating from classic asp to

have a whole lot to add to the great answers so but here are a few things to consider and to make this is the catch all it is easy to assume things that are region or language specific and it is hard to notice these very careful with string there are some such as which have letters that are similar to others visually but which are pseudo translation as a smoke if you read your translated strings from a resource create a pseudo translated version of the file that is still understandable to you but which stresses the capacity and capability of every translatable string in the for pad out a string like with something like so that it is as wide as your allowance for translated then you can test to verify that every string will display extra credit for also sticking in the most complex character likely to be rendered to verify that it displays correctly in all make assumptions about keyboard may be a great control set of directional keys for qwerty but hard coding that makes it if not to use for people with other keyboard various date then test them i have seen issues due to something as small as a different format for in regional the also comes up a but every setting here can various number then test them you do not want to depend on decimal or thousands for with and without a user logged in to the this may be more windows but it is very easy to get a component on the server configured such that it uses the logged in regional settings while a user is logged in and a default regional setting when the user is not logged this can cause intermittent with various regional and language as an not only does windows have regional and language but ie has its own language the behavior of an ie client with listed first may not always be the same as one with listed for sure your translator understands the business and the then cross check with someone be very careful any time you use application specific if your program uses specific words to mean something special in the make sure they are translated in a similar way in every including in the help if you have specific language you might even go so far as to translate such words ahead of time and make sure they translate poorly in the target this is more of a product research but it can make a difference in what words are used in the and it is easier on everyone if those words are in place from the you also want to avoid idioms that may not translate i had more to say than i

have an application that implements by using a hidden iframe with a refresh header meta refresh tag in the many but not all instances of internet explorer so far on ie7 and ie8 beta but not for if you move between two secure pages that both contain this you get something like this sequence of load includes schedules a refresh at click the page2 load includes schedules a refresh at refresh of frame on page1 mixed content error box this point the error page contains both secure and is displayed in the is page to page 2 is the same but says page and links to page is the keep all the browsers i have tested this in i have ensured that the internet zone has permission to do a meta refresh and is set to prompt when displaying mixed i have read all the pages suggesting that you need to have a tag on your iframe or ie will consider it insecure by design it has to have a src which is that of the you sit on page 1 the iframe refreshes the error only shows up the first time after you change to page am looking for a way to fix this with minimal a better method for would be to use a which i will investigate for future a possible workaround i have in mind is having contents of the iframe be a regular xmlhttprequest to the instead of a meta a simpler bugfix would be even i have marked grant answer as correct because it lead me to the actual the lenovo password manager causes this this neatly explains why some people see this problem and not others most of the people i asked have disabling the extension makes the refresh problem go we cause everyone who might use the application to fix this we are going to go with a javascript timer and refreshing the window updating the page to look like is the keep settimeout 15000 function meta refresh inside an https iframe causes mixed content

have an application that runs multiple threads which are sometimes these threads may call into another object that internally accesses a resources to prevent the resource to be accessed there is a critical section to get some order in the when cancelling the it happens that the thread is just within that code that is blocked by the critical the critical section is locked using an object and i was hoping that upon cancellation of the thread this object would be destructed and consequently release the however this does not seem to be the so that at thread destruction this resource object is permanently the resource object is probably not an option party plus it makes sense to prevent simultaneous access to a resource that can not be used in have experimented with preventing the thread to be cancelled using when the section is however this does feel a bit dirty and would not be a final solution for other situations aquired know that a prefered solution would be to not use but instead set a flag in the thread and it would cancel itself when it is ready a clean however as i want to cancel the thread i was wondering out of academic if there would be other options to do a in a critical

have done this trie in c with 8 bit and simply used the array version alluded to by the i am guessing that you want full unicode support a char is among other assuming you have to have support for the lookup is probably your best as a 64k entry array in each node really work very the only hack up i could think of on this is to store entire strings or possibly on branches that do not yet depending on how sparse the that adds a lot of logic to detect the and to split them up when an alternate path is is the read vs update update jul 2013 strings have a function like java to get the bytes for a string then having an array in each node to represent the current byte value is probably a good way to you could even make the arrays variable with bounds indicators in each since many nodes will have only lower case ascii letters or only upper case letters or the digits in some

have found that one of the best investments i ever made in avoiding deadlocks was to use a object relational mapper that could order database the exact order is not as long as every transaction writes in the same order deletes in exactly the reverse reason that this avoids most deadlocks out of the box is that your operations are table a then table then table c perhaps depends on table can achieve a similar result as long as you exercise care in your stored procedures or data access the only problem is that it requires care to do it by whereas a orm with a unit of work concept can automate most a delete should run forward to verify that everything is the version you expect still need record version numbers or and then delete backwards once everything as this should all happen in one the possibility of something changing out from under you the only reason for the orm doing it backwards is to obey the key but if you do your check you will have all the locks you need already in

have this big graph of edges and vertices in 2d the big graph is returned by a function computed in a i am reading this graph and using it to compute all the intersections of its edges lines i use sweep for detecting the intersection of two edges i have though some i have 4 different methods according to which i test if two edges intersect and if affirmative i compute and retain their which test if the two edges are the diagonals of a that coordinates of the edges of one line inserted into the equation other line have different which computes the intersection each time and check whether intersection is between the endpoints of both which is the code from implemented in which implements the first method proposed by jason cohen problem reduces to this do two lines from a to b and from c to d then you can ask it four times the line and each of the four sides of the the vector math for doing assuming the line from a to b is the line in question and the line from c to d is one of the rectangle my notation is that ax is the of and cy is the of and means so ex p f p h number is the if h is between 0 and the lines otherwise they if is of course you cannot make the but in this case the lines are parallel and therefore only intersect in the obvious exact point of intersection is c h is exactly 0 or 1 the lines touch at an you can consider this an or not as you see data that i created data with double i obtained good results with all the 4 implemented when i use anyone of these methods implemented in on the data from the big graph i get different results each time and not good returns much more intersections that i need the points are on the but i get too many always obtain 0 intersections no matter get a lot more intersection than in some example i get points which are not on the graph not even the but for some examples i get the intersection points plus some other have no idea where the problem can any suggestion or any other idea on how to compute the intersection and test it moreover are ore than thank intersection of two

having trouble covering all the issues with doing software configuration management on a cms writing custom of but also custom modules and these websites and apps are for not want to actually version the configuration of the not just the code of its templates and because i want it to be ready to for or transfer to someone as quickly as right that means storing a full install for each site in including the installed versions of components and and storing actual database for i also keep the version of the code i usually bother for the since you can just drop it into the install and it problem with this that currently debating is in custom component in most other extensions are typically deployed using a web installer you least just drop the files in a certain since db changes are the installer system provides for db and file migration with install and uninstall so a pretty reasonable system for i work directly on the installed adding and changing files and then manually copying them to the packaged version of the work on the packaged component and use the installer to actually view the this option just takes too long but it does have the advantage of keeping the code especially in regard to db either the changes are duplicated to both versions of the files before and the duplication seems like a smell to does anyone else do are there better for

hope is not lost it possible to raise an event on a com object from outside of the this functionality is actually provided by com although in an indirect events work on a a com object that has events publishes and one or more other com objects subscribe to the event by attaching an event handler to the source object handlers are called the source object raises an event by simply looping through all the event sinks and calling the appropriate handler how does this help it just so happens that com lets you query an event source for a list of all the event sink objects currently subscribed to the source once you have a list of event sink you can simulate raising an event by invoking each of the sink event the details and being liberal with some of the but the short somewhat politically version of how events work in can take advantage of this knowledge to raise events on a com object from external in it is possible to do all of this in with the help of the com interop support in the and wrote a utility class that will allow you to raise events on a com object from pretty easy to here is an example using the event interface from your legacycomobject new the following code assumes other com objects have already subscribed to the myobj message event at this vb6 objects have two hidden interfaces for classes that raise one the default two the event we want the second because it gives us a that we can use to raise the the method is a convenience that returns all the objects listening to events from the legacy com set up the params for the messagedata cancel raise the event by invoking the event delegate for each connected sink in raise the event via the event ref do cancel processing an is the code for the class well as helper because paranoid and wanted a nice way to deal with the needed by the thoroughly tested the code the code performs manual memory management in a few and therefore there is the possibility that it could introduce memory leaks into your i add to the because this is only an use with com a utility class for dealing with com needs and could potentially be into a regular i extensively tested this there may be a memory leak somewhere due to the stuff going on in the but i think i covered static class get a list of all objects implementing an event sink interface that are listening for events on a specified com event sink com object whose event sinks you want to list of objects that implement the given event sink interface and are actively listening for events from the specified com public static sinks new connectionpoints loop through the source connection find the objects that are listening for events at each connection and add the objects we are interested in to the connectionpoint in connections foreach connection in object candidate i tried to avoid relying on for but returning an empty catch need to release the interface pointer in each connectdata because getconnectiondata implicitly foreach connection in return get all the event connection points for a given com com object that raises list of iconnectionpoint instances for the com private static connectionpointcontainer oneconnectionpoint new connectionpoints new int fetchcount safeintptr pfetchcount new if fetchcount if while return returns a list of connectdata instances representing the event sink connections to the given iconnectionpoint to return connection data list of connectdata instances representing all the current event sink connections to the given connection private static oneconnectdata new connectdataobjects new int fetchcount safeintptr pfetchcount new if fetchcount if while return class a simple wrapper class around an intptr manages its own class safeintptr private bool private intptr allocates storage for an int and assigns it to this the value defaults to public allocates storage for an assigns it to this and initializes the memory to known value this that this points to public gets or sets the value this pointer is pointing public int get if throw new pointer has been return set if throw new pointer has been returns an intptr representation of this public intptr return deallocates the memory for this public void if if class namespace

human being is a machine that writes code and charges you money to do the advantage of a different machine might be that you have to pay it so the development costs of that machine will be so vast that it will be a long time yet before the price comes down low enough to compete with billions of cheap none of the other problems associated with software development will be made any easier by such a change of how does the customer explain what they and how does the coding machine understand their likely way we will produce such a machine is by copying the human brain genome far easier than attempting to millions of years of unfortunately this will give such as grouchiness and a desire to be taken seriously as a and before long there will be campaigns for to be properly this will push the price especially when they start going on people seem to want is a button they can labeled my mind and make me it would probably be easier to develop a button that when you press it modifies your mind so you become happy with with your present

i assume that by pl you mean presentation not persistence implementing a layered application the main question should always can i replace the implementation of a lower layer without impacting the implementation of the is usually best illustrated by the persistence if you switch from sql server 2008 to mysql for the persistence layer changes but are changes in the business layer also for does the business layer catch sqlexception instances that are only thrown by in a good the business layer needs no changes at same principle should apply to the separation between business layer and presentation your i would say that the should not be in the presentation it has nothing to do with the implementation of processing a request is not a concern for the presentation compare it with a web presenting a to a client is the concern of the web retrieving an instance of is the concern of a layer below the presentation whether to have a facade between your business layer and persistence layer is i usually do not implement a facade because it adds an extra layer of i do not see a problem in calling persistence layer methods directly from business layer if only you take the same principle into can you change the persistence layer implementation without affecting the business layer

i believe the answer i was trying to use prototype and yui at the same in theory i think that is possible but you need to pick one or the other when it comes to doing things on the if you know what i i know what was but it was some sort of and once i picked a single mechanism for doing things when the dom was everything is working	
	
i call does it call and do the same if implemented it is just a naming it sounds more plain to close a file than to dispose see finalize and dispose to clean up unmanaged esspecialy a dispose method i want to use an object but then use it again in another should i not call which also means to omit the using because the object gets disposed on exiting the using to if a filestream is wrapping a streamwriter and i call dispose on the this will call and on whether calls on the if i call close on the this will only call and on the is the other a streamwriter is based on an underlying stream an closing the streamwriter closes the underlying stream that may be a see the for hence a single using statement for the streamwriter is	
	
i call from a event it work with the mouse the selection disappears as soon as mouse is people are liking try to explain why i did not like it as much as the accepted is more while the accepted answer does the same thing in a simpler usability of accepted answer is when you click in the middle of the text gets unselected when you release the mouse allowing you to start editing and if you still want to select just press the button again and this time it will not unselect on following if i click in the middle of i have to click second time to be able to if i click somewhere within the text versus outside of the this most probably means i want to start editing instead of overwriting this blog post has some theory on what is going is focus in wpf so to automatically select all text on focus in wpf

i create an abstract property in my base and then a subclass implements is it possible to then reference and use that property in one of my base methods later on once the subclass sets that want to sort of pass a value from my subclass to base class so that in my base class i can perform some logic using it in that base class even not a property but an field i would need to require that field to be set in a subclass if the think even i really need a property if i can set some sort of flag in my subclass via an abstract field so that the base class can use that flag for some logic that my subclass is going to depend on such as sending an i want to be able to set a flag in any subclasses using this base to say true or false so that the base sendrequest method knows whether to chose from a couple of uris that i have set in my base that flag will determine which format to use in the base sendrequest method since each subclass will vary in terms of what uri format the base class should use for that subclass in order to send the httprequest on behalf of the to use abstract property value in a base

i had the need for a matrix type in a trivial answer to this need would be to use but the additional issue i have is that i would like a matrix to store arbitrary values with mixed similarly to a does not perform an example you can the must be homogeneous in if a string value is present in my every value gets implicitly stored as a this is also confirmed by accessing the single the python list type can instead accept mixed you can have a list containing an integer and a both conserving their what i would need is something similar to a but operating in a i had to implement my own i had two choices for the internal list containing and both solutions have of lists require careful synchronization of the various swapping two rows is swapping two columns is less removing a row is easy as a tuple as a are slightly but you have to define the limits of your key you cannot insert element if your matrix is and they are more complex to use to or swap columns or the concrete reason on why i need this functionality is because i am reading csv once i collect the values from a csv file that can be i would like to perform insertion and other operations for this reason i need a curiosities you know if a python data type providing this service already exists in a library out is this data type not provided in the standard too restricted interest would you have solved this or another smarter in

i have a number of related classes that all have a method like override type of may change may also be a and the specific property will certainly but the type of the property will always be further that decided silly to have 8 different classes that all do the exact same thing on an implementation toggle a bool especially when all related on a semantic level also all derive from the same abstract base which is where comes to i parameterize the property that i want to toggle without parameterizing the actual toggle operation for i know i can do something like this class action doexecute public protected override b new how i can i capture the toggling behavior in the while still accepting the writable property as a i pass the toggling in as a then just making an just pass the property in is a value so just be toggling a i pass it in by of properties be passed by i feel like got to be something stupid and obvious that just really missing reason doing such a simple thing in an indirect manner is actually due to the use of the gof command pattern in the core functionality are more but this small subset of essentially just toggles a property that will raise propertychanged events instead of having all these commands in separate i wanted to fold them into one because so do i refactor multiple similar methods of this sort into a single

i have summed up what you need to do when implementing iequatable and provided the justification from the various msdn documentation testing for value equality is desired as when using objects in you should implement the iequatable override and gethashcode for your testing for reference equality is desired you should use and should only override and for and immutable reference interface is used to compare two instances of an object for the objects are compared based on the logic implemented in the the comparison results in a boolean value indicating if the objects are this is in contrast to the which return an integer indicating how the object values are iequatable interface declares two methods that must be the equals method contains the implementation to perform the actual comparison and return true if the object values are or false if they are the gethashcode method should return a unique hash value that may be used to uniquely identify identical objects that contain different the type of hashing algorithm used is should implement iequatable for your objects to handle the possibility that they will be stored in an array or generic you implement iequatable you should also override the base class implementations of and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the for overriding and operator programming returns returns the same value as returns then returns invocations of equals return the same value as long as the objects referenced by x and y are not equals returns false value types for more see types programming new implementation of equals should not throw is recommended that any class that overrides equals also override is recommended that in addition to implementing any class also implement for their own to enhance the operator tests for reference equality by determining whether two references indicate the same reference types do not have to implement operator in order to gain this when a type is that the data that is contained in the instance cannot be overloading operator to compare value equality instead of reference equality can be useful as immutable they can be considered the same as long as they have the same is not a good idea to override operator in operator implementations should not throw type that overloads operator should also overload operator operator predefined value the equality operator returns true if the values of its operands are false reference types other than returns true if its two operands refer to the same the string compares the values of the testing for null using comparisons within your make sure you use the base object class if you infinite recursion will occur resulting in a method your programming language supports operator overloading and if you choose to overload the equality operator for a given that type must override the equals such implementations of the equals method must return the same results as the equality following guidelines are for implementing a overriding equals to gain increased performance over that provided by the default implementation of equals on you override equals and the language supports operator you must overload the equality operator for your value following guidelines are for implementing a overriding equals on a reference type if the semantics of the type are based on the fact that the type represents some reference types must not overload the equality even if they override if you are implementing a reference type that is intended to have value such as a complex number you must override the equality overriding make sure you test reference types for null before using them in the hash ran into a problem with programming and operator overloading described

i have time to address all your questions at the moment may come back to this tomorrow but i can quickly answer the first it ok to use one file for all of my technically as in the language will allow you to do but you beyond the benefits of improving the organization of your it also lets you use a nice feature of php known as you follow the example that page you can define the function as makes it so that you have to explicity include all the files with your class as long as you put them in files named the same as the class autoloading will automatically include files as they are that in your code you show that you have a class named if you save this definition to a file named when you have a line of code new will automatically include at that this is very and is definitely good motivation to keep each class in its own

i know this is a common question but there just seem to be any good answers for have a bucket with gobs have no clue how number of files in they are all within 2k a how do i figure out how many of these files i have used the and jets3t stuff and the best i can find is a command to count the first 1000 records performing gets on been using applet as well cause really nice to work with but even that i list all my objects cause i run out of heap cause it is peforming gets on all of them and keeping them in how can i just delete a the best thing seen is a paralleized delete loop and that has problems cause sometimes it tries to delete the same this is what all the commands that ran across do you guys do who have boasted about hosting millions of what happens when you want to remove are there alternate answers to all of these files are files so not even sure s3 is such a concern maybe i should move this to a document database of it boils down to is that the amazon s3 api is just straight out missing 2 very important operations count and there is a delete bucket command but it only works when the bucket is if someone comes up with a method that does not suck to do these two operations gladly give up lots of to answer a few the reason i ask this was i have been for the past year or so been storing hundreds of more like millions of 2k txt and xml the last a couple of months i wished to delete the bucket it literally took days to do so because the bucket has to be empty before you can delete this was such a pain in the ass i am fearing ever having to do this again without api support for rocks the a good couple gigs worth of files within you steve do i objects in a s3

i like what apps a hybrid of your two proposed i they have an that lives in the install i assume that means that the install directory is made writable during install so that they can run the update having never deployed a application in this i tell you how much of a headache it alternative which you and may not know is using the download when you attempt to load an assembly you can give it a code base to load if you set the codebase to a web url will download the assembly from that url if not found in the download it will also grab the latest version of the assembly from the web url if there is approach can be a pain as likely have to deal with cas security issues if your app needs elevated it is nice not having to write code to download the latest versions of your assemblies for if you want more i can find some resources and give more detailed

i suffered a lot with the same dilemma when i moved to it really depends on your from the java ee world so i would recommend to have as little business logic in your backing beans as if the logic is purely related to the presentation of your then it is fine to have it in the backing believe one of the strengths of jsf is actually the fact that you can expose domain objects directly on the managed i would therefore strongly recommend the otherwise you end up making too much work for yourself in manually exposing each furthermore it would be a bit of a mess when inserting or updating data if you encapsulated all the there are situations where a single domain object may not be in those cases i prepare a before exposing it on the if you are going to encapsulate every object property that you want to i would recommend that you instead bind ui components to the backing bean and then inject the content directly into the value of the terms of bean structure the turning point for me was when i forcefully ignored all the stuff i knew about building web applications and started treating it as a gui application jsf mimics swing a lot and therefore the best practices for developing swing applications would mostly also apply to building jsf

i was hooking into but this took too long as it fire until firefox has loaded the dom tree for the page and any of its was similarly slow because it requires the page to fully load as well as all its after going through as well as setting up xpcom for and a few i ultimately settled on as that seems to fire even when the html page has no or has an equivalent to the previous remember why i settled on but i believe it was because it was the best fit for my needs which the quickest way to get the navigated url without waiting for anything to load while simultaneously firing on every conceivable way a new page is new page and all only catch is that you will need to add code to manually look up the url in your overlay startup as unless you before ff starts loading the first page on new you will have added your event listener too late to reliably catch that initial page is because a isolated instance of your is loaded every time firefox opens a new

i worked out where i was going the image scan data is saved in but the actual important info is encoded as variable length bit this means that the end of the actual image data does not necessarily fall on a byte when the jpeg encoder needs to pad out the number of bits to make the byte boundary it simply adds a series of the way the actual pixel info is stored is a little too complicated least for to but basically everything is encoded within minimal coding units or these vary in size depending on the chroma horizontal and vertical sizes being either 8 or 16 for each there are dc and ac parts that make up a single component of or cb and the problem was that the dc components are stored as values in relation to the relevant dc value of the previous so when i added the new image data from jpg it had stored its dc values in relation to 0 there were no previous but it needed to take into account the final dc values of the last mcu from jpg that makes need to do an initial decode of the image data to find out exactly where the image data ends and then strip the trailing you also need to change the initial dc values in the second jpg you then need to reencode the appropriate add 1s to fit to a byte et you want to append in the its a little more you have to rearrange the mcus so that they scan in the right jpgs scan from left to then top to bottom and then adjust the dc values far only tested this on single mcu but theoretically it should work with bigger ones i only worked this out thanks to the owner of this jpg related

id attribute is only to be used once within each the difference is that you then have a unique id for a specific element within the which is handy when or in fact even for css when you need to style specifically only one is more of a you can specify that an element should have one or more which describe properties about only have one header on a given alternate have multiple and this item is one of the alternate it is also the last you could even give it the id if you know for sure that there is always only one last item in the

implementation is for a few your method should have a single purpose to call right you are putting far too much logic in and not actually of the single idisposable resource you you do not need a finalizer at since you do not directly own or allocate any unmanaged the only resource that you are disposing of is a which is and will implement its own finalizer as if you want to trap and find the cases where a connection was not disposed i would set up a finalizer to warn of that the finalizer in idisposable is meant to handle the case where the gc must do the cleanup because the caller forgot to call in your the finalizer will take care of that for part of the idisposable pattern as suggested in the design guidelines from microsoft states that the client should be able to call multiple times with no there should be nothing using the socket directly after the first call to in i would suggest that should call or as and immediately set to prevent this from being a with your current it is very possible to have the calls in cause the socket to throw an exception on subsequent calls to which should be a strong suggestion to have a method on all resources that use a or other should call there should be checks for use of the any method on the connection used after disposal should throw an

implementing constraints that simply call a clr function for each constrained clr function is one or two lines of code that attempts to construct an instance of the data class associated with that for a class has a constructor which throws a meaningful error message when construction fails when the score is outside a valid what do you think of that for it centralizes my data types in making them available throughout my while also enforcing the same constraints within the so it prevents invalid manual edits in management studio that may try to working well so although updating the assembly causes constraints to be requiring a recheck of all constraints is perfectly i use checkconstraints with to make sure the data in all tables is still valid for enabled and disabled making corrections as until there are no then i the constraints on all the tables via table with check check constraint there a statement to with check all check constraints on all or do i have to them table by for the clr functions used in the check i can a in each function to catch data construction returning false on and true on so that the clr raise an error in the database out the just construct the instance and return allowing that aforementioned error message to be raised in the database prefer because my functions are simpler without the error and when someone using management studio makes an invalid column get the meaningful message from the clr like for type x match regular expression instead of some generic sql error like there any severe negative consequences of allowing clr errors through to sql or is it just like any other failure resulting from a constraint on implementing check constraints with sql clr	
	
implementing idisposable most including the framework suggest including a bool member in order to safely allow multiple calls to as well as to throw when works fine for a single when you subclass from your disposable and a subclass contains its own native resources and unique things get a little bit most samples show how to override but do not go beyond that to handling are two questions that i have in this subclass and the base class both need to be able to track the state of there are a couple of main options i know of declare private bool in both each class tracks its own and throws as use protected bool disposed private instead of a this would let the subclass check the disposed provide some protected helper method to check the disposed and throw by pulling the current type name via reflection if the object is advantages as disadvantages i see to each by option this to me since it contains duplicated but seems to work i often use this when subclassing other this takes out the duplicated but is not the way the design guidelines books are this is what i typically since it keeps it a single point for this seems like the cleanest option to but appear in standard it may be a little less expected of an approach than others from users of the at one point or have tried using all three of these i would like to know advantages and disadvantages to the three as well as any other ideas for a better way to handle what choice would you make in handling and throwing the what do you use for the name i know the method call new is a comment this from a microsoft employee suggesting that implementing the concrete full name is the appropriate the third option this would be the only meaningful if the class implements the throwing you could potentially return the name of the class that defines the method that was the base class could return the base not the concrete think this is a good idea but i ran into this on some code written by somebody are there advantages or disadvantages to having the name of the class implementing the method objectdisposedexception correctly in an idisposable class

in any practical understand why helpful to compare drm with encryption is a mechanism to share secrets with trusted second parties without the possibility of a untrusted party receiving the secret encryption is built upon a very solid background of and works because the second party is considered to be trustworthy of the key to unlock the secret on the other assigns no trust to any party except the original the assumption is that the second party has a revocable right to the secret and is not to pass the message to any other even if they want the problem with that is the second party must somehow still decrypt the even though they are not trusted with the ability to do this is the basic conceptual challenge of accomplishes this using two first is the algorithms and keys used to encrypt or decrypt the managed message are themselves kept patent encumbrance is used on some usually the decoding so that the parties that do know that part are prevented legally from disclosing it to other or using it at all without proper of these features are in opposition to open by its very open source discloses any bit of code released under supposedly open source that happens to also be patent encumbered fails to in fact be free

in the code example below runtime converts a value between void sqldatasourceselectingeventargs i failed when converting the nvarchar value type the above exception suggests that runtime did manage to convert of type string into a value of type and thus happened on since string and int32 are incompatible why did conversion from string to int32 in the first the fact that dealing with incompatible type that app most likely has a similary to the that dealing in the code below with s i void int employeeid name for whatever reason employeeid parameter is convert null to zero and passed it as argument to does runtime make such a throwing made more the convertemptystringtonull property to specify whether string value is automatically converted to null when the is updated in the data quite understand the usefulness of this why string indicate that we want null to be inserted into assume that this data field is of type not also have convertzeroint32tonull city from employees where i assume that when you specify of which type it is automatically of type which means later be assigned value of any thus if is later event handler assigned a value wrong this wrong assignment will only be detected on and not before of course sql server will report that to web server if we create a sqlparameter instance of type and pass this parameter to a stored will pass to procedure just the value of this or will it inform the procedure the exact type of this parameter source controls and parameter type

in the process of adding mvc to a webforms one of the neat features of an mvc solution that you create from scratch is that a right click on the solution explorer and add new will give a list of templates which include the mvc in a webforms app these templates thought that there might be a setting in the solution file that indicated that one was an mvc app but i find anything that that stuck to expand the how does visual studio know to add a menu item on to the menu when you right click on the controllers folder in the solution explorer of an mvc likewise it adds a menu item to the menu when you right click on the views where does visual studio get this info from and how can i add those 2 folders to another web app and get the same do you activate the mvc templates in vs2008 from a webforms

is a good it turns out that the option to web does not exist for the option to web does exist only for the to do you need a new to your vs 2008 solution you copy all the files in the old to your created override any files created in it next step is the most you need to add the in your to the new i thought the vs powercommands toy would do this for as it does copy references from project but it you to do it by you have to be cautious in this if you have multiple versions of same assembly ajaxtoolkit in or assemblies that have both and local versions or repeating the last step and trying to build the keep getting errors like is unknown are missing an assembly sure you have none of those except ones where is replaced by ids of the server controls you other keep adding and building the project until the errors that exist because missing or go to the root project node in 2008 solution and click then you will find option to web what this option does is making small changes to the and directives of pages and creating the or building the if you get see references may be missing click the to web if any other than those caused of designer not all will have designer files created for fixing the non designer problem clicking to web again should do the job for you are done successful vs you should be ready to start testing your web you can right click root project node vs 2008 solution explorer and then go to the tab to set the to virtual folder in iis can new virtual directory from there if you want to use the virtual directory that the you need to that from iis when testing your pay most attention to classes especially with no those can be a we had a problem with extension method overloads in the static class that had no extends and calls another overload extends datetime calling other overload as extension passed vs 2008 compilation and gave a compilation error only in changing the call to other overload from calling it extension method to calling it normal static method the call in the same calls other classes remained method did solve this not as safe as it to be in vs especially classes with no during the vs 2008 renames your this new name but do not rename it the all will be in one in the web server does not know what project type you are it take all code in folder create a new assembly for if you have code in folder end up with compilation errors that the same exist in two the created by and the one created iis development avoid leave the with the same or rename it anything do place any code in such folder and prefereably do not have folder with such name in your at know this since before but forgot now as i have not used for long

is definitely measurable overhead when calling a virtual function the call must use the vtable to resolve the address of the function for that type of the extra instructions are the least of your not only do vtables prevent many potential compiler optimizations the type is polymorphic the they can also thrash your course whether these penalties are significant or not depends on your how often those code paths are and your inheritance my opinion having everything as virtual by default is a blanket solution to a problem you could solve in other you could look at how classes are generally the header for a class should make quite clear which functions can be overridden by derived classes and how they are having programmers write this documentation is helpful in ensuring they are marked correctly as would also say that declaring every function as virtual could lead to more bugs than just forgetting to mark something as if all functions are virtual everything can be replaced by base classes private everything becomes fair by accident or intention subclasses could then change the behavior of functions that then cause problems when used in the base	
	
is definitely not a good choice for because requires and friends are also no good because an position cannot be that the position of an element in a map cannot be enforced by the user with insertion into a particular position or a among the standard containers down to and is like other standard algorithms in that it only acts by swapping values around so even if list would magically support access the links be reorganized but rather their values would be change the size it should make no difference in runtime performance whether you use or primitive arrays should be also fast to probably even faster than the standard containers but i expect the difference in speed to be significant enough to justify using

is the correct way to represent a value such the dom level 2 call is the null value is is also used to indicate a valid element with no content even if that elements content type normally allow empty an empty tag is returns the empty string the tag is then no author tag is even this may be semantically different than setting it to setting to nil may be that the book belongs to no while omitting series could mean that series is an inapplicable element to the current structures introduces mechanism for signaling that element should be accepted as when it has no content despite content type which does not require even necessarily allow empty an element may be content if it has the with the value element so labeled must be can carry attributes if permitted the corresponding complex you have a book xml element and one of the child elements is you have several options when filling it the element entirely this can be done when you wish to indicate that series does not apply to this book or that book is not part of a in this case xsl transforms other event based that have a template that matches will never be for if your xsl turns the book element into table row you may get the incorrect number of table cells using this the element empty this could indicate that the series is or is or that the book is not part of a any xsl transform other evernt based that matches will be the value of will be you will get the same number of tags using this method as with the next described this signifies that the element is not just your xsl transform other event based that have a template matching will be the value of will be empty empty the main difference between this method and is that the schema type of does not need to allow the empty string as a valid this makes no real sense for a series but for a language element that is defined as an enumerated type in the allows the element to have no another example would be elements of type if you want them to be empty you can union an enumerated string that only allows and a or use a decimal that is

is the knapsack problem if you can either pick a product or if you can pick fractional values of products then you could solve this with the simplex but the fractional knapsack problem has a simple the items by picking of the highest ones until you run out of then pick a fractional value of the highest remaining example if prices are and energies are the ordering you would pick items 4 and 2 which would cost with the remaining you would buy of the first item for a price of and an energy of would give a total energy of that allowing fractional values will give you a higher objective value than only allowing or so no integer solution will do any better than 14 for that matter since the objective value has to be an solve the original knapsack you can use a which should work just fine in assume that you have a current candidate solution with an objective value of the relaxed where you allow the fractional if the value is less than discard this a new value z which is the solution found without the last fractional if this value is greater than replace with your new one item the first in the the most profitable and form two one where you include it in the solution and one where you include it in the solution is the branching long as you have subproblems left to pick one and go back to step that when you create the subproblem where you must pick an just subtract its price from the budget and add the value to the now you have a smaller problem to a more detailed description look at and on

is very but it looks like reading value types from a can restrict generics to be reference types or value and you can initialise an empty variable with the t stream input where t to be a value t returnvalue a return int index conversion return also better off passing your stream in as a bear in mind that in these are templates you will get a copy of the code compiled for each type this rules out referencing the library from as when the is compiled it necessarily have the type that the code is asking for there is only one class and it can be referenced

is what we not have all the hardware and software components we need right now to do amazing things for years to believe there is a disease in the where ever participant is always trying to invent something new to distinguish themselves from this is in contrast to doing some of the messy work of cataloging or teaching older who build things are generally considered of a higher pedigree than people who reuse existing and something almost ancient to say a 20 year old to whom something like say lisp was made more than double their life time in the old ideas need to be resurrected and propagated far and and we need to stop trying to build businesses or programmer movements that effectively trample old works and systems in to be the next new in fact most things are just aspects of old ideas	
	
is when the existence of a row in a child table depends on a row in a parent this may be confusing because common practice these days to create a pseudokey for a child but make the foreign key to the parent part of the primary the way to do this is to make the foreign key part of the primary but the logical relationship is that the child cannot exist without the a has one or more phone if they had just one phone we could simply store it in a column of since we want to support multiple phone we make a second table whose primary key includes the referencing the may think of the phone as belonging to a even though they are modeled as attributes of a separate this is a strong clue that this is an identifying relationship if we literally include in the primary key of is when the primary key attributes of the parent become primary key attributes of the a good example of this is a lookup such as a foreign key on referencing the primary key of is a child table with respect to but a row in is not identified by its is not part of the primary key of relationship can be or which means the foreign key column allows null or disallows also my answer to confused about identifying

judicious use of another tool freely available on the following two scripts do the job you get password with no set in do set this just to prove we have the get password with no echo then echo oscriptpw simply uses the password object to input the password from the user and then print it to standard output paragraph will explain why that show up in the is a bit trickier command scripts usually set command simply outputs the prompt with no trailing a sneaky way to emulate it sets to an empty string as a side effect and wait for input since taking its input from the in do set statement is the trickiest it runs the vbscript with no microsoft advertising so that the only line output is the password the vbscript the delimiters to nothing is required to capture input lines with otherwise you just get the first the do set sets to be the actual password output from the we echo a blank line terminate the and echo the password so you can verify it is my is available with xp and 2k3 but not necessarily later for vista and presumably win7 are give them a mask the the script takes advantage of the scriptpw com scriptpw is loaded by default on windows xp and windows if running windows 2000 or windows you will need to copy the file from the folder of an xp or windows 2003 system to the or folder on your windows 2000 or vista once the dll has been you will need to register it by running the successfully register the dll on a vista you will need to open the command prompt as to do click start all programs then on the command prompt shortcut and select as once at the command prompt as be able to successfully run the command to register the

keeping track of what were the offsets marking the beginning of your segments and each segment length you want to compute that upon which would involve sort the offset list and calculate the distance between two of you will want to check the header of the http response sent by the server to make sure it supports the usage of the range the best way to specify the range is and the range you request includes both and byte thus consisting of micro chunks is something advise against as you might be blacklisted by a firewall rule to block http in suggest you make chunks smaller than 1mb and make more than 10 on what control you plan to have on your if got control you can consider writing only once every 32k at or writing data comment on the mmf but if the downloaded file is large not going to be a good idea as eat up a lot of ram and eventually even cause the system to which is handling the you could just create several files one per optionally preallocate the disk space filling up the file with as many as the size of the chunk might save you sometime while you write during the but will make starting the download and then finally just write all of the chunks sequentially into the final thing you should beware of is that several servers have a concurrent connections and you get to know it in so you should be prepared to handle http and to change the size of the chunks or to create a queue of the chunks in case you created more chunks than

key is in understanding how the line b given how your code is this line is the equivalent of b that is the order it will execute the assignment happens before the the first effect of this line is that and both refer to the original object the portion will be inside of the operator we increment the of the original at this point and are both pointing at the with a of and will continue to do created a new object inside the operator method and returned it as the output of the will now be updated to point at the newly created now points to a new while continues to point to the why the writeline output appears pointed the operator is meant to do by generating a new breaking that operator overloading on objects is a tricky and this is an excellent example of why better avoided in most for the assignment does not actually happen before the increment when dealing with operators on but the end result is the same in this the original object reference is the operation is carried out on the and then the copied reference is assigned to the just easier to explain if you pretend that assignment happens really happening is that b in due to how the operator works on copy x new original balance is a now points to the new copy still points to the b b and copy now point at the

key pair is not used to encrypt the whole instead it is used to the a to sign a file such as an assembly you take a hash of the file and then ecrypt that hash with your private someone using the file verifies your signature by making a hash of the file themselves and then decrypting your encrypted hash using your public key and confirming these two hashes are the this proves two assembly is from who is claims to be from you as it has been produced with your private assembly been altered by someone else as the hash you made when you released the assembly is the same as the current can alter the signed assembly since they would also have to make corresponding changes to the encrypted hash which requires your private is a lot more detail about digital signatures in wikipedia great thing about key pairs is that they work either way so something encrypted with your private key can be only decrypted with your public key but also something encrypted with your public key can be decrypted with your private this latter use means that if someone wants to send something to you and only you then then can encrypt it with your freely available public key but they know only you with your private key can decrypt the keys only work as a pair making the someone else simply reverse the encryption done with the public key to get the message to	
	
key parameters of the api you cited are the picture the and the the tag can be either the user id of a facebook or it can be text the case when the tagged subject is not a facebook facebook uses just one coordinate because it uses regions to denote a tagged the idea is that you click on the center of a and facebook just stores that you display a picture in a control the obvious first after you can detect mouse clicks with the and event is but tell you the once acquired a prompt for a label to accompany that you can use predetermined like user or just use ordinary or use something of your own the question of what you use to represent a tag value is orthogonal to whatever other questions asked so other half of photo tagging is that moving the mouse over the image displays the tag text over the and moving the mouse over the labels below highlight the associated handle events and write some code to display or hide labels and shapes as if you use and you might not even have to modify the but showing those controls on top of the image might interfere with further events for the it take too long to try some experiments and see what works for

know at so anything i say about should be taken with a grain of i will try to explain what goes on in that piece of ruby has something called these have nothing to do with the singleton software design they are just methods that are defined for one and only one you can have two instances of the same and add methods to one of those two are two different syntaxes for singleton one is to just prefix the name of the method with the so would define a method only for object the other method is called up the singleton and it looks syntactically similar to defining a because also what happens singleton methods actually live in an invisible class that gets inserted between the object and its actual class in the class syntax looks like this opens up the singleton class of object and every method defined inside of that class body becomes a singleton method of object is this used ruby is a pure which means that including classes is an if methods can be added to individual and classes are this means that methods can be added to individual in other ruby has no need for the artificial distinction between regular methods and static methods are a they really just glorified what is a static method in is just a regular method on a class singleton of this is just a longwinded way of explaining that everything defined between and its corresponding becomes every variable that starts with a capital is actually a in this case we translate these as but rather an because how they are caches data received from a the difference between this method and usual is this method caches data and allows to data when it is expired data generation code more than once so bring our servers def ttl method has three parameters we will see exactly two of them are optional and both of them have a default in the case of the default value really it serves more as a marker to find out whether the argument was passed in or is an extension that the library adds to the it actually do it just returns it is used in this case just to make the method definition more are other methods which do something more which returns and and so we will use this as an that the type of the parameter should not be but rather fallback to default caching approach if no ttl return yield unless contains several complex ruby start with the easiest trailing conditional if a conditional body contains only one then the conditional can be appended to the end of the instead of saying a b then foo you can also say if a the above is equivalent to ttl then return yield next one is also is just syntactic sugar for we are now at not ttl then return yield is truth in truth is pretty falseness is pretty and truth falls out the special keyword is and the special keyword is everything else is in this case the conditional will be if is either or a terrible sensible value for a so the only interesting one is the snippet would have been more clearly written like then return yield since the default value for the parameter is this conditional is if no argument was passed in for the conditional is used to figure out with how many arguments the method was which means that we are not going to translate it as a conditional but rather as a method on to the in every method can accept an implicit code block as an why i wrote above that the method actually takes not a code block is just an anonymous piece of code that can be passed stored in a and invoked later ruby inherits blocks from but the concept dates all the way back to to lambda at the mention of anonymous code but at the very least at the mention of lambda you should know how to represent this implicit fourth method a delegate more a it transfers control to the basically just a very convenient way of invoking a without having to explicitly store it in a variable and then calling create window for data ttl syntax is called it means the token inside the string with whatever the result of evaluating the expression between the just a very concise version of which is exactly what we are going to translate it try to get data from value stale if stale key has it is time to our unless value nil force data if no data retrieved or data data and reset stale unless value return is my feeble attempt at translating the ruby version to class static const enum stale created caches data received from a the difference between this method and usual is this method caches data and allows to data when it is expired data generation code more than once so bring our servers public static tvalue timespan timespan create window for data var realttl ttl generationtime var stalekey try to get data from var value var stale if stale key has it is time to our if is value force data if no data retrieved or data data and reset stale if is value return fallback to default caching approach if no ttl public static tvalue return simulate default argument for has default so this be public static tvalue timespan return new convenience overloads to allow calling it the same way as in by just passing in the timespans as integers in public static tvalue int int return new new public static tvalue int return new note that i do not know i do not know i have not tested i even know if it is syntactically hope it helps

know for a fact php itself work with unicode because i have tried using unicode page names in mediawiki also runs and it does urls such as so php can handle but it may be a problem with apache finding a file where the source file has a setting for character encoding should not be affecting it is the job of the web server to find a specific resource and then call php once determined to be a php it will mean that the web and the underlying file system have to be able to deal with it work without the if you disable the rewrite engine with rewriteengine off and then request if then it may be a config issue or a problem with the in urls may not be properly supported in some browsers when you just type an address such as older older browsers may skip the encoding this should not prevent it from working if you are following a link on a where that page is

know how authoritative this is but i found it seem good to have a lot of connections to this seems to be bad for the web and most applications that have more than a few having a hard time thinking of what sqlite would be used for when you need that many every program i can think of needs lots of them so what would i use a database for that allow that many i thought about prototypes but why would i use that when i can just connect to a larger embedded apps thanks i look at the page recommended below but an confused about appropriate uses for sqlite it where sqlite works usually will work great as the database engine for low to medium traffic websites is to of all the amount of web traffic that sqlite can handle of on how heavily the website uses its generally any site that gets fewer than 100k should work fine with the 100k figure is a conservative not a hard upper sqlite has been demonstrated to work with 10 times that amount of where another rdbms may work you have many client programs accessing a common database over a you should consider using a database engine instead of sqlite will work over a network but because of the latency associated with most network performance will not be the file locking logic of many network filesystems implementation contains bugs both unix and if file locking does not work like it it might be possible for two or more client programs to modify the same part of the same database at the same resulting in database because this problem results from bugs in the underlying filesystem there is nothing sqlite can do to prevent good rule of thumb is that you should avoid using sqlite in situations where the same database will be accessed simultaneously from many computers over a network going to show my ignorance here but what is the difference between these is sqlite used	
	
know how to to use the default platform ui they know what they look how they and the platform ones work really know how to use your and even if you try and copy the platform one except for your widget will behave as a cheap it will be missing features the user your scroll thumb to show the length of the with a minimum size such that its always but only on platforms where that is scroll to the position scroll down and scroll up and each in proportion to where clicked on the scrollbar on the platform where this is clicking in the blank space between the thumb and up or down arrow does it scroll by the amount the user is which varies by scrolling go at the speed the user expects when the scroll buttons are held is the user dragging the thumb handled when the mouse goes outside the or on the your custom scroll bar follow the visual theme the user selected because he needs widgets due to answer to most of those is probably at been my experience with web sites where the designer decided the platform scroll bars cute

know the difference between smalldatetime and right now i am using smalldatetime because the precision is good enough for my but the problem is that i still need to keep inserted items in order and smalldatetime is mixing things up if the inserts come too close to each it an acceptable practice to use both a smalldatetime and a timestamp i would use the smalldatetime to know when the item was inserted and the timestamp field to order things i do not consider using datetime a valid solution since it will have the same problem with keeping things ordered if the inserts are made fast way to keep track of an ordered smalldatetime

know this is normally rather but shoot me before reading the i promise i have a good reason for needing to do this possible to modify regular private fields in java using however java throws a security exception when trying to do the same for assume this is strictly but figured ask anyway just in case someone had figured out a hack to do just say i have an external library with a class class someclass private static final someclass instance new public static someclass return public object do some stuff here essentially want to someclass so that i can execute my own version of since there my any way to really do that in my only solution here is to alter the value of so it returns my version of the class with the modified i just want to wrap the call with a security check and then call the original external library always uses to get an instance of this class a just to is called by the external not my so just subclassing solve the i do that the only other solution i can think of is to entire class and modify the this ideal as have to keep my fork up to date with changes to the if someone has something a little more maintainable open to there any way to modify the value of a static field in java from outside the i need to monkey patch an external

like you hit on a hot as a designer i think the best way to improve your ability in that regard is to look at a lot of good actively seek them pixeline not a lot of objective knowledge to be learned there is more about improving your aesthetic if you look at high quality designs all the then your tastes will become more refined and your web designs will naturally conform to your acclimated i work at an indie metal so from time to time called upon to work on band album magazine so always flipping through metal magazines and looking at ads designed by other or admiring the merch designs of other or checking out the sites of other not only serves as a source of inspiration when helps me to gauge my own abilities and find areas for but it also helps me track the trends and fashions in my particular sphere of as we all fashion is and tastes are always a good designer knows how to stay just ahead of the curve all the this means that your designs deviate too drastically from accepted aesthetics your designs will be rejected by but you also want to employ design elements that are overused and played you can ride the edge and innovate enough to stand but not so much that the audience is unable to accept then you will have mastered the art of web a good designer can identify emerging trends and capitalize on while making it their own by adding their own twist to just starting to venture into be afraid to emulate others and steal good and give credit where credit is but just as making copies of famous is an essential training technique in figure drawing so too is emulating quality designs an effective tool in learning graphic like web and are excellent places to immerse oneself in quality designs and i would highly recommend scanning through these sites in your free time to flood your mind with examples of good i also want to emphasize that talent is not as much of a factor as most people would more is what people confuse as if you truly have an interest in you will be motivated to immerse yourself in it and practice this in turn leads to better and if started at a young age builds which leads to an ability which leads to more confidence and more which in turn leads to more consider myself a decent graphic designer can check out my portfolio via my profile and an alright and people often comment on how talented i but they realize that i have literally spent thousands of hours honing my while other kids were out playing with their i was in my room the only reason i excelled in and when i first started building they looked just as hideous as most myspace so get discouraged when you see the work of they all started from humble beginnings as

look at simply putting everything in this is and above drawbacks include the fact that have to read everything into memory at startup the user a pretty loading bar and they even and perhaps have to do a little extra work to ensure everything is reflected to disk when the user thinks it so that data this analysis making some generic assumptions about i really know that much so hopefully somewhat accurate remember the g1 has 192mb of your assumption above was a max around 1000 superclass 8 pointer 4 8 interned string avg 32 64 point 4 point 4 92 bytes possible memory alignment fudge factor 128 items items i realize that while a child can only have one a parent can have multiple the number of pointers is so the average cost of pointer is 1 element or 4 this assumes a child structure that allocate unused such as a linkedlist opposed to an the nerd in me says that this would be a fun place to profile a but i think overkill for what you want at the moment whatever solution you end up if you are not holding everything in you will definitely want to cache as much of the top levels of the tree in memory as you this may cut down on the amount of disk activity if you want to go all another possible solution might be as bill karwin suggests a rather elegant structure called a closure for optimizing tree based while making writes more combining this with top level cache may give you performance although i would test this before taking my word on evaluating a use whatever you have in memory to evaluate as many children as you for those children that do not use an sql join between the closure table and the flat table with an appropriate where clause to find out if there are any matching if be displaying that node on your result this all makes sense and seems like it would work for what you	
	
look into protocol or like another poster you want to roll your please do it you use types from and make sure every variable has address is divisible evenly by size are are on even are on addresses divisble by you have to worry about alignment or a previous job we had all structures sent over our databus or canbus or byteflight or serial defined in there was a parser that would validate alignment on the variables within the structures you if someone wrote bad and then generate header files for various platforms and languages to send and receive the this worked well for we had to worry about code to do message parsing or and it was guaranteed that all platforms have stupid little coding some of our datalink layers were pretty bandwidth so we implemented things like with the parser generating the proper code for each we also had which was very nice be surprised how easy it is for a human to screw up coding bitfields on enumerations by you need to worry about it running on 8051s and hc11s with or over data link layers that are very bandwidth you are not going to come up with something better than protocol just spend a lot of time trying to be on par with

looking at improving the performance of page load and render time of a rather complex to the use of a lot of controls that themselves include javascript files simply using the certain pages load the same javascript up to 10 some javascript must be loaded early in the while others is better included at the some i would like to dynamically load after the onload event instead of explicitly include in the way thinking about is to let all the different controls register their need of a particular javascript file in a central place that in turn controls the generation of avoiding and where they are inserted into the generated this would also make it easy to dynamically switch between minified and full javascript files appending to the query string would make files load by instead of this solution it would also be possible for it to basically generate a javascript array of filenames that are used by a custom onload javascript function to dynamically load the is the best way to accomplish use or extend something like make a custom override the page to best control loading of multiple javascript files in

looking for tips on the best way to reconfigure the log4net logging level dynamically in my i generally use a simple configuration where the root logger defines the default logging etc there may be several each with filters to define the logging levels they first thing like to be able to do would be to allow administrators to connect to an admin page that enables them to view the current level for the root logger and dynamically change i want to use and write to the configuration file on disk because i want these changes to persist when the application is like to go and on an admin page be able to display a treeview with all current loggers that exist in the and their current logging and allow the administrator to be able to change the logging level selectively at any level of the idea is to to create a generic admin page that i can put into all my apps that allows administrators to selectively enable logging dynamically for troubleshooting find the log4net apis a bit can anyone point to samples or show the best way to achieve answers are equally good so accepted the first to i can get all current loggers as log in logger parent level effectivelevel null is the effective level same as level if the latter is not otherwise inherited from the least one of the loggers returned above will have the root logger as which enables me to get a reference to the root the above it should be possible to reconstruct the logger implemented an server control that displays the logger hierarchy in a treeview with and allows the user to dynamically change the logging level at any node in the works great and be putting it on admin page in all my web and web service reconfigure

looking to create a application using a using wcf as a possible communications will host the in a windows service with wcf using i suppose i could define every service operation into a single service but there could be quite a few operations and rather divide them into several cohesive service splitting my operations into a set of service contracts mean that i would have to host each service on a separate be ideal as prefer to run it on one design tips regarding this thanks for any confusion it my intention to host each service operation in a different only to group them my problem stems from the fact that i thought that it possible to host multiple servicehosts on one says that it is possible to simply host multiple service hosts on one i think i must have misunderstood an exception message when i was trying this out if i can get this to work then i think it will be my favoured think that and approach of implementing each interface on a single concrete object and hosting it in a single servicehost is also a good pragmatic solution to my especially if you treat that single concrete object as a sort of one downside i can think of is that you be able to have different servicebehaviors depending on the i do agree with logic of when appropriate to implement multiple service contracts on one concrete

main difference as i understand is that in debug mode the whole symbol information which is used by the debugger is stored along with the so that if a developer wants to debug the application before releasing he may do by attaching to any you noticed the files in the debug also the size of the executable is fairly however in release the debugger symbol information is omitted assuming that the end user is going to use the application so he must not be provided with the application can think of the symbols as the information proivided to the debugger to understand what local what where breakpoints are set and all sorts of information so that it can precisely tell you what part of code is being executed

main problem i see here is one of you say you want your ann to take the current board position and evaluate how good it is for a assume you will take every possible move for a apply it to the current board evaluate via the ann and then take the one with the highest output hill options as i see them some heuristic function to evaluate the board state and train the network off but that begs the question of why use an ann at when you could just use your some statistical measure such as many games were won by white or black from this board which would give you a fitness value between white or the difficulty with that is the amount of training data required for the size of your problem the second option you could always feed it board sequences from grandmaster games and hope there is enough coverage for the ann to develop a to the complexity of the problem want to throw the largest network lots of internal at it as i could without slowing down the training too	
	
main sources of memory leaks i can think of references to objects you need any more in some sort of so here you need to remember that all things that you add to a collection that you have reference too will stay in circular having delegates registered with an so even though you explicitly reference an it get garbage collected because one of its methods is registered as a delegate with an in these cases you need to remember to remove the delegate before discarding the with native code and failing to free even if you use managed wrappers that implement often the clr clean them fast because it understand the memory you should use the

making a distinction between member and free functions when i was thinking about the but i now see that this was a it now seems to me that structs should only rarely have member it is pretty clear that everything in a struct should be there is generally no point in having struct member functions because any function can change the data in the a member function on a struct would be a convenience rather than a only exceptions would be things required to be member functions for some other purpose constructors for initialising comparisons for use with a things used by class and struct should be seen as opposites a class exposes functions and hides whereas a struct exposes data and allows you to hide back to the byte swapping int void int void i swap void s s makes sense when the data and some functions do not always strongly belong byte swapping would only be of interest to the network system but higher level functions can still use the struct without even knowing about low level stuff like byte benefit in this case is that the related byte swapping operations are all kept together in the same	
	
making many websites i found myself reusing the same scripts over and and i found some things tremendously tedious because i never bothered to abstract them away before for if you have any experience making you should have a pretty good feel for what your framework should if i would probably start by thinking of an mvc file get your framework to first work with then then then make sure each of those is easily extendable because no matter how hard you there will always be things and then just start slapping on utilities as you need them model in other come up with a project for which you would like to use the and build the framework and website

may be others with different but in mine checking in code is a horrible are the principles i have learned and try to in often at least but preferably many times per check in complete the first and second conflict it takes more than a day to make the functionality then the task is too large break it into smaller completable code should never be checked in since it is not is not a valid archival so whether code or code being commenting and checking in make any in if the code is not ready to go to the next stage that is for it should not be committed to a trunk or after reading the other answers and add that i think necessarily a good idea to commented code sure how enforce that what i will say is that you should get everyone on your team to buy in to the philosophy i described the team i work on embraces it as a source control is a frictonless one that helps us get our job who embrace that philosophy usually cause and are often frustrated by source they see it as a necessary evil at and something to avoid at which leads to infrequent which means changesets are huge and hard to which compounds makes checkins something to avoid even this is ultimately an attitude not really a process easy to put up mental barriers against easy to find reasons why it just like easy to find reasons not to diet if you really want but when people want to do it and are committed to changing their the results are the burden is on you to sell it

maybe one of the few people here old enough to remember one of the big reasons why one return was pushed so so the compiler can emit more efficient for each function the compiler typically pushes some registers on the stack to preserve their this the function can use those registers for temporary when the function those saved registers have to be popped off the stack and back into the one pop mov instruction per if you have a bunch of return then either each one has to pop all the registers makes the compiled code or the compiler has to keep track of which registers might have been modified and only pop those code but increasing compilation reason why it still makes sense today to try to stick with one return statement is ease of automated if your ide supports refactoring a range of lines and turning them into a very difficult to do this if the lines you want to extract have a return statement in especially if returning a

method is not stored in the serialized as simple as as for objects in the vm during the size should be regardless of how many methods the class of the object	
	
method is one of the most usefull methods in programming and many other such as have the exact same method implemented at the can define your own and the signature in must always be override string means this method will override the one define in the and returns a you manipulate your string in whichever way you want and then return the the specific reason you can use tostring on that integer is because within integers are all instances of the struct seeing as is at the same level of a it can have its own one of which is	
	
method is one that can be called without having an instance of the that has nothing to deal wtih the lifetime of the newly created you could use a method with the same the factory method usually need any data from an existing object of the same class and therefor need an existing instance and this is why factorey methods are usually will use to create the object that the factory will usual to return them by this shows explicitly that a new object ant the caller must take care of its	
	
method looks like it should though passing in n as a parameter makes it using the input length field would be and you could even handle jagged arrays that a copy of the contents is not since strings cannot be changed which leads to the main what kind of changes are you making that seem to be reflected in the show us the code that does	
	
method might be faster than comparing a string to its version as it requires only 1 static boolean c return return note that there might be some localization issues with different character i have any first hand experience but i think there are some languages where different lower case letters can map to the same upper case

methods that be static be were discussing this today and kind of on the imagine you have a long method that you refactor a few lines out the new method probably takes a few local variables from the parent method and returns a this means it be question it be not static by design or simply by its nature in that it reference any instance methods that be static be

might be out of the scope of a java in global keyboard hooks are definitely out of the scope of simply using but i can help you get moving in the right you have some point you into the direction of native which will allow you to use native since you want to stay in the java i suggest not directly using jni because have to write some confusing native code there are several wrappers for jni that allow you to use the functions but the native implementations are abstracted but a lot of these cost the best solution for i is native this allows you to directly call native libraries from within the implementation not will be cross you have to make separate implementations for a good example for windows keyboard hooks in the examples on the project for opening own window not in a do you want the applet to not run within the browser but in its own separate or just be in a separate window and still rely on the browser window being you want to simply launch a new window and still require the browser to be then a good frame window new is the title is the public void you want the applet to spawn a new process and run without the need of the look into

most important point is that heap and stack are generic terms for ways in which memory can be they can be implemented in many different and the terms apply to the basic a stack of items sit one on top of the other in the order they were placed and you can only remove the top one toppling the whole thing like a stack of a there is no particular order to the way items are you can reach in and remove items in any order because there is no clear like a heap of licorice does a fairly good job of describing the two ways of allocating and freeing memory in a stack and a what extent are they controlled by the os or language heap and stack are general and can be implemented in many computer programs typically have a stack called a which stores information relevant to the current function such as a pointer to whichever function it was called and any local because functions call other functions and then the stack grows and shrinks to hold information from the functions further down the call a program really have runtime control over determined by the programming os and even the system heap is a general term used for any memory that is allocated dynamically and out of the memory is typically allocated by the with the application calling api functions to do this there is a fair bit of overhead required in managing dynamically allocated which is usually handled by the is their call stack is such a low level concept that it relate to in the sense of if you disassemble some code see relative pointer style references to portions of the but as far as a higher level language is the language imposes its own rules of one important aspect of a is that once a function anything local to that function is immediately freed from the that works the way expect it to work given how your programming languages in a also difficult to the scope is whatever is exposed by the but your programming language probably adds its rules about what a is in your the processor architecture and the os use virtual which the processor translates to physical addresses and there are page they keep track of what pages belong to which you never really need to worry about because you just use whatever method your programming language uses to allocate and free and check for errors the fails for any determines the size of each of it depends on the operating system and a stack is usually because by definition it must be contiguous memory on that in the last the language compiler or the os determine its you store huge chunks of data on the so be big enough that it should never be fully except in cases of unwanted endless recursion or other unusual programming heap is a general term for anything that can be dynamically depending on which way you look at it is constantly changing in modern processors and operating systems the exact way it works is very abstracted so you normally need to worry much about how it works deep except that languages where it lets you use memory that you allocated yet or memory that you have makes one stack is faster because all free memory is always no list needs to be maintained of all the segments of free just a single pointer to the current top of the compilers usually store this pointer in a fast for this subsequent operations on a stack are usually concentrated within very nearby areas of which at a very low level is good for optimization by the processor

most my answer is is the purpose of your software if it is an application aimed at a specific set of users with specific needs then you need to make sure you meet enough of those needs to make it worthwhile for people to use your system most people believe once twice shy you get a second would you buy a car that turn left your application is more and aiming at a particular slice of users from a wider base techie to help evolve your app along agile then release early and many of these types of system plan releases based on but on version will be released when all the tickets assigned to are marked as or

my opinion exception handling is not something generally acceptable for embedded gcc nor microsoft have exception both compilers insert prologue and epilogue statements into each function that track the scope of this leads to a measurable increase in performance and memory performance difference is something like in my which for my area of work is a huge the memory overhead was far less but still significant i remember the figure but with easy to compile your program both ways and measure the seen some people talk about exception handling as an if you use based on what observed this just when you enable exception handling it affects all whether a code path can throw exceptions or not makes total sense when you consider how a compiler would also stay away from rtti for embedded although we do use it in debug builds to sanity check downcasting

my predecessor know something i or am i right to be saying when i look at this your predecessor you are see note at the seems like insanely inefficient and difficult to maintain like and it makes running reports extra difficult because the data i need could be contained in text fields or it might be in one of a dozen tables that have similar information and are used in different parts of the insanely see note at the column should always be an indivisible attribute of the i see two copies of three attributes in this column be description color would have been better designed code primary desc txnid something primary txnid something txnseq int primary quantity code foreign key price possible that this was done to preserve historical information in the face of changing values elsewhere in the for if the description of a stock item changes or the item is not the right way to handle in that foreign key constraints would have stopped the item code from being deleted and processes should have been in place to prevent the description from being updated as versioning the stock item if going to search on any of the items within that this is perfectly though unwise in terms of possible future functionality to search on the only thing ever searched on in this table is the customer code then a text field is still do it that way but a yagni argument can be made that it would be better to change the db schema in the if and when that search functionality needs to be

my understanding of your have a point on the specified as direction is the direction that a person at that point would travel to reach the north pole by the most direct possible that the north is tangent to the surface at your chosen point and points directly parallel to a line of direction of the motion will be tangent to the surface at your chosen have an angle in degrees from true north which specifies the heading at which this point is going to angle is the angle between the north and the direction of motion of the want to calculate a vector that is tangent to the surface at that point but perpendicular to the direction of motion of the understood all that you can do it as north at latitude longitude is given by vector perpendicular to the north which points along a line of latitude the is given by these two vectors identify the plane tangent to the and the vector specifying the direction of motion of your point is also in that your motion vector is a linear combination of the previous where is your heading find a vector perpendicular to that motion you can just take the cross product of the radius vector the vector pointing from the center of the earth to your with the motion math would be best to let the computer handle

my we also use i installed but had already used and it really offers many great refactoring and supporting renaming methods and reordering i really like is that according to your corporate code you can configure resharper to give you hints on style violations in different severity levels quickly apply according like ms but much easier to configure and more absolute favorite feature is by entering only the you type tshwlov and resharper will know that you mean the class from some referenced library named year i have tried the devexpress after i was quite impressed by the things that oliver sturm did with it on basta spring interface catchier and more impressive than there are huge arrows flipping around your ide and things like though the core functionality is rather had the feeling that coderush is more focussed on code creation than on more shortcuts for tasks like creating variables favorite feature there was a which always shows you all available in your current this makes you learn those commands where in resharper you have to look up most of them in nested suites are really powerful and it after months of using them you will probably still discover new which you have always needed without knowing i decided in favor of resharper mostly because of i was more familiar with it and devexpress was using much resources on my notebook and occasionally even slowed it by i use a much more powerful machine maybe i will give it another try

never had a problem with interpreting oracle error part of the reason is that every interactive tool seen for developing sql for oracle helpfully points to the location the query went that includes as others have and the perl dbi from prepare table or view does not exist error possibly near indicator at char 14 in from statement from at line that a bit hard to read since all squished on one but a gui tool would be able to point to the token where oracle started having problems with the and given a bit of work on a you could write a tool to pick out the offending answer the underlying oracle errors seem to be designed to work the way you as far as i can none of the the error messages in oracle support variable oracle returns two bits of an error number and a location where the error if you have proper pretty easy to diagnose an error with those pieces of it can be argued that system is nicer to tool creators than one which provides variable amounts of diagnostic data depending on the imagine having to write a custom parser for all of error messages future to highlight the offending including the table name would be just knowing where things went wrong can be a huge select from where dummy from where dummy at line invalid table for why oracle chose to do thing this i have some used this style of error message for system which larry bob miner and ed oates copied to build oracle number and location are the smallest possible representation of diagnostic i indicated to simplify the creation of tools that connect to any i think you need to be a dba to figure out which table you just need to use the proper adjust your i

new to and development on but hopefully i can frame this question in an understandable way regardless want to parse an xml feed for my iphone and i decided instead of shoving all of the delegation methods from an instance of nsxmlparser into my view wrap this up inside of a feedparser after reading a few docs and example what i came up feedparserdelegate feedparser nsobject id id delegates of my feedparser object just have to implement as i started actually making my class use i realized that i have to specify that implements a protocol for i could just implement the delegate methods that i wanted to do something i think noticed this with other classes that follow the delegate but not why i too just not bother with specifying a formal protocol for my it would cut away some perhaps unnecessary i guess the question why would i to create a formal protocol instead of just doing something like just checking to see if the method is implemented on the delegate with is it only so that the compiler will issue nice warnings if a required delegate method i have to specify a protocol if i want my class to have a	
	
new to but my impression good jvm integration will be the driving jruby can call java and java can call jruby but explicitly calling into another not the clean integration of so you can use java and even mix and match in the same started looking at scala when i had a realization that the thing which will drive the next great language is easy the jvm has good concurrency from a performance sure someone will say that erlang is but scala is actually usable by normal java falls down is that just so painfully it takes way too many characters to create and pass a scala allows passing functions as possible in java to create a union or to apply an interface to an existing these are both easy in typing usually has a big penalty of scala eliminates this downside while still giving the upside of static which is compile time type and it makes code assist in editors ability to extend the this has been the thing that has kept lisp going for and that allowed ruby on

no way to get a single sequential series without it matter what mechanism using to assign the next value a performance a static whatever when two threads both need the next value at the same one has to wait on the first thing do is write a test program that spawned a large number of threads which each repeatedly called a locking increment function such as the one daniel schaffer that will let you find the threshold where your application starts to thrash where spending more time waiting on than doing anything that turns out to be a problem and bet that if the volumes talking about are it will then you should make each thread maintain its own sequential which you can do by marking the counter field with the you can then generate unique identifiers off of a combination of the id and the approach work if not using a thread pool the counter dies when the thread it belongs to and you probably also want to make the startup count part of the compound so that you have to write the thread counters to durable you do when you restarted the server the threads would start generating counters at zero and if your application created a thread with the same id as an earlier get duplicate is obviously not trivial to write more so definitely recommend proving that necessary

not specific to new programming the book open source by karl fogel to read may be contain some hints to the issue of making a community around your new programming terms of adoption of programming languages in it seems like the trend lately has been to have a rich library to make development times there much detail on what your language is hard to determine whether adoption of the language is going to depend on the availability of a rich perhaps your language will be able to fill a niche that has been overlooked by other languages and be able to gain or perhaps it has a slick name that will draw people in there are many factors which can affect the adoption of a are some factors that come to mind when thinking about recent successful to leverage existing libraries in the new an adapter to external libraries written in other allows access to code written in c through the a platform which already has plenty of libraries available for and target the java therefore allowing the use of and interoperation between existing java design and syntax to allow increased languages have gained such as and python to name a concise and clear code can be written in languages such as as opposed to verbose languages such as features such as as and which offered in more languages such as c and community of dedicated users who also are willing to teach newcomers on the benefits of a human factor is going to be big in support for a language if people never start using your it gain more another suggestion that i could add is to make the development of your language open keep your users posted on developments in your and allow people to give you better let your users take part in the if you feel that is believe that by offering ways to participate in the bringing up of a the more people will feel that they have a stake in the success of the new so the more likely it will gain more

not sure how literal that code is intended to be so some of these observations may not be truly numers like this i think it is poor style and you should look into using an you are simply returning something and there is no additional logic in a subset of the you might consider putting the in an array or dictionary and simply addressing them by their index rather than using a switch	
	
not sure how photoshop implements but the paint node within compositing application is pretty easy to stoke is stored as a series of along with some information like you draw a the changes are made on the current strokes i the current image is cached into you it redraws the last stokes on the previous cached are two problems with you undo more than 10 it has to recalculate the whole with thousands of strokes this can cause a several second you save the setup containing the stroke information not the actual pixel then means you have to recalculate the whole image whenever you reopen the paint or render the image nearly as big a problem as the undo there is a third that being shake is horribly buggy and poorly implemented in many the paint node beign one of them so not sure how good an implementation this but i imagine photoshop being too dissimilar better

not sure i fully understand the question but i think you are wanting to create a collection of polymorphic when accessing a polymorphic you must always refer to it by a is an first you need to set up a base class to derive your objects virtual void create the array of i use an stl set because that makes it easy to add and remove members at add an create a derived class and instantiate enemy public virtual void rendering code goes to access just iterate through it it create different types of just derive more classes from class forget to delete the objects when you remove them from the

not sure if i should my own or use a comment for but here understanding is that volatile prevents optimizations from moving the accesses to my result variables the completed such that the the thread that reads the result will see want the boolean made visible to all threads the due to compiler or emmpry you want the writes to the results being seen after the further on the in regards to items mentioned by matt i should point out whenever a thread calls an the cpu forces so if you are variables via interlocked do not have to worry about all of memory model thread synchronization locks call interlocked it would seem as pointed that the result do not require the volatile keyword the example as shown since manualresetevent ensures you are both in agreement that such an operation takes care of caching between processors or in registers does it prevent reording to guarantee such that both the results are assigned the completed and that the completed flag is assigned true the manualresetevent is my initial assumption was the background thread potentially run multiple obviously overlooked the name of class given it is only run it is not to me why the calls in the manner that what is the point of initialwaitms milliseconds if background thread may or may not done at the time why not just kickoff background thread and use a lock synchronize access to the variables or simply execute contents of the function part of the thread that is there a reason to do concept of the sample is to execute a if the task can be completed within an exceptable amount of then the calling thread will get access to the result and continue with normal but sometime a task can take quite a long time and the claiing thread cannot be blocked for that period and can take reasonable steps to deal with that can include checking back later on the operation using the completed concrete a dns resolve is often very quick and worth waiting for even from a but sometimes it can take many many so by using a utility class like the one could gets a result easily from the of the caller of the time and not lock up the gui the other one could use a background but that can be overkill for an operation that the vast majority of the time need all that it seems to me that not some kind of locking mechanism on results variables is still a it is not needed the code as result completed data is meant to be if i added a lock to assign the results and also have to lock in my result and i never liked seeing getters lock just to return a data from my such locking is not if an operation has 5 or 6 the caller has to take and release the lock 5 or 6 times at some down the another thread may along and try to access the would be better in my mind to for this possibility now rather try to track down mysterious anomalies i have a volatile completed flag that is guarenteed to be set the volatile results and the only access to the results is through the and as mentioned in the an exception is thrown if the getter is called and the operation is not yet expect that the completed and result getters can be invoked by a thread other than the one that called my hope i believe this to be true with the volatiles

noting that the reason actually that the size of the enum is not yet known after forward you use forward declaration of a struct to be able to pass a pointer around or refer to an object from a place refered to in the forward declared struct definition itself declaring an enum would not be too because one would wish to be able to pass around the enum you even have a pointer to because i recently got told some platforms use pointers of different size for char than for int or so it all depends on the content of the current standard explicitly disallows doing something like but the next standard due to next year allows the which convinced me the problem actually to do with the underlying x known as a enum you can even use x in the following and its enumerators can later be defined in a later redeclaration of the see in the current working

now that we know a little i think the whole question may be from a little good friday fooling that you should be able to extract the data you need in a matter of probably need a couple of to get yourself set figure out exactly what you need to how to store it and what to do with it when got but the fun part how i think you could approach the know the file a large be xml i see about structurally pretty simple you need from which you need to extract some basic text at least the links within and maybe a pretty simple parsing job no need for xml libraries or a simple string matching algorithm should for use to find the open and close tags and extract the bit for the first link in the text a bit because you have to determine the first real link according to the 21gb of text into memory would be a good but of course you have to do you just need a chunk to work a megabyte would seem or maybe not a big deal chop off a gb or so to experiment have a script that extracts and writes to a text file about pairs a it ignores pages processing many more and ignores links with a smart enough by but i wanted to put some processing in no no about 30 lines of not very terse it found about million titles think there are more projects and and wrote a rather more focused and manageable of output in about 20 ruby windows 2ghz core 2 and they say first 3 development

object is a local variable with type that variable likely gets allocated on the stack for the just like any other local but the stored in is a null it point there is no instance of type represented call a virtual the caller needs to know which object the function is being called because the object itself is what tells which function should really be frequently implemented by giving the object a pointer to a a list of and the caller just knows supposed to call the first function on the without knowing in advance where that pointer to call a the caller need to know all the compiler knows exactly which function will get so it can generate a instruction to go directly to the desired it simply passes a pointer to the object the function was called on as a hidden parameter to the in other the compiler translates your function call into since the implementation of that function never makes reference to any members of the object pointed to by its you effectively dodge the bullet of dereferencing a null pointer because you never dereference calling function even a one on a null pointer is undefined one of the allowed results of undefined behavior is that your code appears to run exactly as you rely on although you will sometimes find libraries from your compiler vendor that rely on but the compiler vendor has the advantage of being able to add further definition to what would otherwise be undefined do it

of them can be complicated and complex in their own can do in the grand scheme of it might not matter which you what does matter is how well you do what you are most experienced if your leading a do what the team is most experienced have done a lot of threaded and i enjoy parts of and parts of it i do not learned a and now can usually write a application without too much but it does have to be written in a very specific it has to be written with very clearly defined data boundaries that are thread whatever condition that can will and it might not be when you have a debugger laying plus debugging threaded code is like peering into by looking in other threads may or may not have had time to process it has to be written with test code that stresses the many systems only show their bugs when the machines are heavily there has to be some very smart person who owns the data exchanging if there is any way for a shortcut to be some developer will probably make and you will have an errant there has to be situations that will reset the application with a minimum of this is for the production code that breaks because of some threading in the show must go have less experience with but have recently been doing some stuff in windows the ipc is web service and it is relatively clean and but i follow some rules here as by and interprocess communication will be much more error free because programs receive input from the outside world very and those transport mechanisms are usually define clear process boundaries and communication oh tcp or web services or pipes or whatever is as long as the borders are and there is a lot of validation and error checking code at those be prepared for code forgiveness is very by this i sometimes you be able to write to that you have to be able to requeue and retry those messages without the application locking an there will be a lot more code in because transporting data across process boundaries means you have to serialize it in some this can be a source of especially when you start maintaining and changing that this

ok to require if to have an else if it makes it easier for scheme supports returning multiple values from a so if you were to implement the return values as a you could have an empty list signify that no return value was make sure eval returns a important distinction not returning an empty list if there was no else the empty list signifies that there was no return if there were one return value from an expression it was you would have as the return from the eval behind the returning multiple values from an expression would cause the eval return list to have multiple in all you could really return if the condition fails and no because it would be an error in a program to attempt to capture the value of a function that return as it would be the job of the not the to catch this

on march two years after i originally answered this question i come back to see that it has pretty much turned into a big i feel about time i come back to it and make my answer truly correct since it is the most upvoted the answer is wrong as it is not what the original poster asked for it is correct that it is possible to reset a form using the native but this question is trying to clear a form off of remembered values that would remain in the form if you reset it this this is why a reset is i assume most people ended up in this question from a google search and are truly looking for the but it does not work for the specific case the op is talking answer was not use answer might work for a lot of including for the but as pointed out in the comments and in other will clear elements from any value more answer not to by by the selectors by themselves is considered bad practice by jquery as they end up evaluating to which makes it take much longer than it i do prefer the whitelist approach and wish i had used it in my original by specifying the part of the plus the cache of the form this should make it the best performing answer answer might still have some flaws if default for select elements is not an option that has a blank but it is certainly as generic as it is going to get and this would need to be handled on a

original question seem to recall reading that the cost of a virtual call in is not as as in the in other the question might be rephrased seem to recall reading that in virtual and calls are equally whereas in a virtual call is slower than the questioner is not claiming that is faster than under any a useless but this sparked my curiosity concerning with using no the compiler produces il that gets converted to native code by the although it is pure so here we have a way of seeing what a standard implementation does if running on the same platform as a void new causes the opcode to be emitted with the specific method passing bar an implicit void with an inheritance virtual void derived void if we new emits the opcode which jumps to a computed address so a lot of il before the by turning it back in to we can see what is going other cast the address of to a pointer to int happens to be the same size as a and take the value at that which is the address of the and then take the first item in the which is the address to jump dereference it and call passing it the implicit can tweak the virtual example to use struct virtual void struct derived virtual void override gcnew generates the exactly as it would in instance void when compiling to target the current compiler have the same possibilities for optimization as does when using the standard features of each for a standard class the compiler generates code that contains logic for traversing the whereas for a ref class it leaves it to the jit to figure out the optimal

orm compared with stored procedures it except your concern is speed think the problem is many people think of orm as a object to to code less or simplify sql while in reality is well an object to relational db is used to persist your objects to a relational database manager and not just to substitute or make sql easier although it make a good job at that too you have a good object or using to make or even if just trying to get some orm is not worth in the other hand you have a complex system modeled through objects were each one have different rules and they interact dynamically and you your concern is persist that information into the database rather than substitute some existing sql scripts then go for	
	
orm will always add some overhead because of the layers of abstraction but unless it is a poorly designed orm that should be the time to actually query the database will be many times more than the additional overhead of the orm infrastructure if you are doing it for example not loading the full object graph when not a good orm will also give you many options for the queries run against the database so you can optimise as required as

other answers are good either hashing you are comparing the file to multiple or a comparison comparing two single are a couple of additional check the file sizes if they are then waste time comparing these are quick to try searching from the end or the middle of the file using a binary chop suppose you have a file like it is modified to the file size to remain the and content to have been the other bytes will be so a binary chop approach might pick this up with less reads in seek to and read bytes to from both and could try to combine the if you do it over a good enough sample of the data you deal you might find that of all the different files you compare were found because the file size was different per were found due to binary chop per were found due to linear byte comparisons per a binary chop over the whole file be so since i expect the hard disk will be faster if reading linearly rather than seeking to random but if you check then then for say 5 you might find most of the differences without having to do a bytewise some instead of reading from the front of the perhaps try reading from the end of the file again you might be trading off seek time for but in the assuming a change is made halfway into the probably find this faster by starting from the end than from the

pointers is connected with two orthogonal in you should allocate when the object is intended to live longer that the scope in which such an object is a resource which owner have to be clearly specified commonly some sort of smart by of how the object was in this context pointer mean such accessing could be needed already existing interface requires which could be null should be of large objects should be avoided or copying is impossible at but the reference be used stl and can occur in different for example you can imagine dynamically allocated object accessed by but such the object could also by passed by reference to some you also can get pointer to some object which is created on the

possibly a little off there is actually a wm6 feature for allowing calls to be routed either over the cell network or over sip using the if sip calling as the ui has is enabled and there is a wifi connection the call will be routed over if not it will route over gsm in the normal there is actually also a registry setting that enables the calls to routed over sip if there is a connection available manufacturers do not ship the part of the wm6 os that enables this functionality on their device roms mindful of their call however it can easily be installed on most wm6 if this is not what you are after you want to use sip but use a calling card or need to have the choice after you place the i can tell you it must be possible to do what you want to do because this app does it one way i can think of doing this is to get notification of the immedialety end wipe it from the put up your pbx or cell and then place the call again in the way the user this has the disadvantage that if the original call was started programmatically the app that did so will think the call was ended it may also be possible using another but that is where my knowledge runs	
	
possibly because not waiting for the socket to be connected before sending you have two the data asynchronously from your callback the data synchronously by blocking this thread until accomplish by combining the data to send and the socket into a new then passing that as in your call to then move your send code to the callback accomplish by setting up a and calling after then call in your callback followed by a on your then proceed to send as you have also probably learn more if you find out what kind of the msdn you receive a use the property to obtain the specific after you have obtained refer to the windows version 2 api error code in the msdn library for a description of the

pretty clear that the two functions being called in the same mentioned in another alert the value to see what really getting in the function itself looks so the only conclusion is that they are not working from the same data or they are called in different recommend posting a little more of the code in the call	
	
pretty easy to do i would encourage you to do it unobtrusively via the pattern explained is a solution that follow the encouragement i just gave the sake of not changing to much of your code and allowing you to easy see what its return might be better is adding a class to this something like and then all links with an xhr class and observe for a click and then fire off the xhr here is how do in your change the link element somewhere your script area wait for the dom to be loaded use utility method to find all the with class xhr iterate through each of these links and attach the following will cancel the from anything happens is after the dom loads before the page is your will be attached to all with the class it captures the click fires off an xhr and prevents the event from preforming the default action this case following the link to another by calling the

pretty new to jquery as and i actually used its ajax functionalities so please pardon my but are you sure you need quotes around and in the pairs sent as data parameters in the because i see quotes being used around variable names in the jquery reference manual i nor in other code samples it seems to me that you would only use quotes around literal like if you were trying to actually post something something like this might work i might be totally

previous solutions for two sets see edit history for is a way to do it recursively for an arbitrary number of static if throw new have a product of fewer than two sets return static ret new if else for obj for set return that it is impossible to keep any generic type information with the returned if you knew in advance how many sets you wanted to take the product you could define a generic tuple to hold that many elements instance but there is no way to have an arbitrary number of generic parameters in	
	
previously done the same as long as you store the customer type then not difficult to get the correct may consider 2 tables and use views to union them if there is going to be one table that is much larger than the although an index on the customer type will do much the same by the same i mean make data of one type quick to nice thing about putting all the data in one table is you have to do any joins to get to the which helps with the speed of the query and ease of	
	
previously used a not in the xp but in the sense that every task has a coder and a reviewer nominated before the coding the coder and reviewer work together identifying the correct solution so the reviewer knows what is meant to be done to perform the work is done in a branch by a single coder trunk and check in until the work has passed and a diff is generated for the whole if using something brain dead like a checkout per task is needed so changes for each task are if using something less brain dead not strictly the branch method works best because then the reviewer can generate their own diffs off the branch and no need to email them around you can check in works in progress without destroying the main a required state to your work flow in the issue tracker called one called when the dev has finished reviewing the code they can add their comments to the issue tracker and forward the ticket back to the developer for rework or merging depending on whether it worked if it worked well set it to the integration state and if it was bad put it back to process has worked reasonably well in all the places seen it	
	
price is a factor you could have a look at which is a pretty decent vb styled ide for it costs but there is a freeware version which includes an unobtrusive on compiled	
	
primary benefit of is that you have to write any nearly glue code to get remote processes to there are a wide variety of client libraries available for many in the case that you have a rich api of can be a very easy way connect remote processes to that performing the same task with a plain post will require you to convert an api to a form and dispatch requests into api there are a few systems that can help with but it is certain to be more difficult than just exposing the api through the other if it you already have a rich api exposed through plain form encoded hard to justify the work of porting both client and server to another

private methods that reference anything would seem to be a concern to i agree with the earlier responses that these could be good private static may want to look and see if these are being called from more than one if only one method calls them then you may want to refactor and replace that code in the method that was calling methods are what you as you want as few ways into the class as so that the class is more	
	
probably already read this section of docs about memory but point you to the section about the ownership just in you are only responsible for managing the memory of objects you to quote the own any object you an object using a method whose name begins with or or contains or you own an you are responsible for relinquishing ownership when you have finished with you do not own an you must not release section of those docs provide good but to put the points above in the context of your specific am i supposed to memory manage these good news you ignore the the memory management aspect of the objects in your they just created or did they always may have always or they may have just been the beauty of is that as a consumer of those have to i retain and if i release the object that created will they be released as need to retain them if just passing them on to some other or using them as intermediate values yourself in your own calculations within the for that returning the from your example function to someone no point in retaining it just to return you do happen to retain then you are responsible for issuing a corresponding release message as some you for retain the from your example if you want to hold on to that value as a property in your own uses reference if you need that object to stick around for a long you must retain it so that someone release message cause it to vanish if the retain count falls to they say you ask for a string from if has to create that string just special for you order to service your but otherwise care about that then probably put that string into the autorelease if the string was already a property of and it was just sending it to you in response to your then it probably the beauty you know and need to since created the it is responsible for managing you can ignore the memory management unless you add to the string by sending it a retain if i run a million times in a can i dispose of all those nsstrings as yours to manage because you create as a technical if really did have to create 1 million copies of to service your 1 million it probably put them all in an autorelease which would be drained at the end of the current cocoa event unless you send each of those objects a retain you can gleefully ignore the memory management question	
	
probably depends how dynamic your web site i used wiki software once that used rcs to check in and out text i recommend that solution for something that gets as many updates as stackoverflow or the thing about database is that they scale and the database engine writers have figured out all the fiddly little details of simultaneous load

probably not interested in participating in it the google summer of code has a of that are a project participating generally means that it wants more it has mentors who are willing to help new and it has an ideas list with tasks that are good for someone just getting started on the code base they are generally designed to be a full summer long they do range in through this list can definitely help you find things to do more easily than trawling through every open source project available on or github is nice because you can so easily hack away with as many patches and throwaway branches as you and then request that your code be merged in once its

probably worth noting that you should step back and ask yourself if you really need the items stored in a list with random indexed or if you just need to enumerate each of the keys or values from time to can easily iterate over the icollection of item in if you actually need to store it as an nothing particularly inefficient about copying all the items just an if you need to do it that why if annoyed by writing the code to do wraps the code that write into a copy constructor that already implements the code you were planning to which is probably what you actually care no more efficient than what

problem is likely to be that your code is running on assuming that doing this using the standard jquery method of running code on and not using the onload in any even using jquerys will be too slow if you have a lot of other javascript files to as the event fired on the document until all javascript includes have should be able to work around the issue by including your code that modifies the table just after the html for the table in your page and not running it on load make sure you wrap it in this approach to you will need to have all javascript required by the code which is modifying the table included earlier in the you have other javascript files you should try to include them later in the not sure how being inside an update panel will affect it you will need to make sure that your code is being when the updatepanel but i believe this should all happen

problem is that it gives the wrong impression it makes it look like the value when actually only the value that rather than the i think the code analysis is being overly cautious here there are plenty of places where you might want a mutable type stored in a readonly particularly if initialized in a static initializer and then never mutated within your the field is more of a risk of derived classes abusing personally i like all my fields to be on the other i know your code it could be that weighed that up against the possibilities and decided the right thing to really is less to worry other than the general impression of immutability given by the fact that the field is disable the warning for that and add a comment to emphasize that the object is mutable even though the field is	
	
problem is that regexes are potentially so powerful that you can do things with them that you should use something different good programmer should know where to use and where the typical example is parsing languages whether a language is think that you go wrong if you at first restrict yourself to regular expressions some extensions can make your life a bit but if you find something hard to express as a this may well be an indication that a regex is not the right	
	
problem is that this is a fairly complex animation that requires one part of the control to be inverted and squished while the remaining are of the control is so this be answered with a simple scale or stretch you might be able to use multiple animations on visualbrushes that point at your user but it does get complex to swap these things in and out at like to recommend you check out the transitionals project on includes many different kinds of animations and one may be close enough for if you can look at how the transitions are built and see if you can tweak one to meet your the most performant way to do this is with shaders require some and are written in hlsl if interested in learning more i highly recommend you check out the following custom effects for

problem we have now in your development is that there are a few who make team more sometimes this people can become a bottleneck for some parts of the like using for the shared knowledge they post enough comments to their tickets in issue tracker of this our management sometimes can not fire some if they want it very because without him we will spend so much time to understand what he has that this problem be solved with just because sometimes it is impossible to that there enough documentation produced for the until you will face the be applied in our because the team is talked a lot about this problem at our but it seems more like conceptual we change this this problem can be to make team more

problem with pointers is not the the execution and language additional confusion results when teachers assume that the concept of pointers and not the or the convoluted mess c and makes of the so vast amounts of effort are poored into explaining the concept in the accepted answer for this and pretty much just wasted on someone like because i already understand all of just explaining the wrong part of the give you an idea of where coming someone who understands pointers perfectly and i can use them competently in assembler because in assembler language they are not referred to as they are referred to as when it comes to programming and using pointers in i make a lot of mistakes and get really i still have not sorted this let me give you an an api is a pointer to the does it could number representing an address to a give it do i say or number representing the address to an address to a that or or number representing the address to the address to the address to the or is it or even so and the language involved make it as clear because it involves the words and that hold as much meaning and clarity to me as holds the address to and function requires an address to the answer additionally depends on just what the heck is to begin and what doit intends to do with the language support the levels of nesting that are encountered in like when i have to hand a in to a function that creates a new and it modifies the pointer to point at the new location of the does it really want the or a pointer to the so it knows where to go to modify the contents of the most of the time i just have to guess what is meant by and most of the time regardless of how much experience i get at is just too is a pointer an address to a or is it a variable that holds an address to a when a function wants a does it want the address that the pointer variable or does it want the address to the pointer

processing xml by means of standard attribute order is not guaranteed after you serialize at last that is what i just realized when using standard java xml transform api to serialize the i do need to keep an i would like to know if there is any posibility on java to keep the original order of attributes of an xml file processed by means of dom or any way to force the order by using an alternative serialization api that lets you set this kind of in my case processing reduces to alter the value of some attributes of a sequence of the same elements with a bunch of and maybe insert a few more there any way or do i have to define my own xslt transformation stylesheet to specify the output and altering the whole input xml i must thank all your the answer seems now more obvious than i i never paid any attention to attribute since i had never needed it main reason to require an attribute order is that the resulting xml file just the target is a configuration file that holds hundreds of alarms alarm is defined by a set of this file usually has little modifications over but it is convenient to keep it since when we need to modify something it is edited by now and then some projects need light modifications of this such as setting one of the attributes to a customer specific just developed a little application to merge original file to all with specific parts of each project the value of some so file gets the updates of the base one alarm definitions or some attribute values my main motivation to require ordered attributes is to be able to check the output of the application againts the original file by means of a text comparation tool as if the format attribute remains the the differences can be easily really thought this was since xml handling such as xml lets you edit xml files and apply some ordering maybe my only choice is to use one of these programs to modify the output of xml attributes after dom

programming can be amazingly however you be hiring programmers in you force developers to pair it only works when two developers click and decide they can learn from each other and build something awesome my advice is to hire as many of the smartest developers you can find and put them in a setting that naturally lends itself to encouraging pair developers need to be able to code but also talk to others on the team about the right mix that works for you and your company will be more art than and certainly not something you can do by blindly following the demands of some published the more bugs you squash before they ever get checked the more you save in the long having another developer looking on as you architect something will always be more effective than having a tester it call it money well	
	
programming language has specific ways of handling relies a lot on so you might wanna check everything you learn about concurrency should apply whatever the os or language there are roughly 4 problems you must learn to directly related to your questions but these are subjects you should learn in parallel to learning a particular syntax in a given java is of course quite easy while might be a little your are also a number of known for synchronizing threads such list goes on and but are basically helping or variables that will help you solve the 4 problems

proja depends on projb and projb depends on proja then i am surprised you can build it at this sort of circular build dependency normally kills clean you often get away with it on dev machines where an old proja is still lying around when you build projb and but on a clean machine then this kind of dependency often breaks what the dependencies it might be simplest to move the common dependencies to a new assembly that has no dependencioes of its but which both proja and projb depend this means you can then build then proja and projb in any order this kind of refactoring is often simplest when you are only depending on interfaces from projc rather than concrete sure this entirely answers your but it might give you an alternative way to fixing

question is a bit as it sounds like you want to get all of the original sequence but then you have both 4 and 8 mapping to and nothing mapping to you actually meant that to be a then what you are looking for is a random permutation of the original there are ways to do this with or without collecting up the set first need something that generates or keep track of where you note that n is not you can always use and then add n to everything if interpreted this correctly and you are actually looking for a shuffle algorithm random called shuffles by analogy to shuffling a deck of have a look at based on your the problem you face is you want to encode the permutation but you must encode it somehow in order to construct the easiest way is just to actually store the permuted indices in an but if you want to do that for some reason too you can encode it in various there is no free lunch as there are information theoretic limits on how simple this can you can get some ideas from looking up work on for example something like

real consideration between separate date and time fields or 1 datetime field is you do not want to do from where a datetime field because it use an mysql will convert the startat data to a date in order to compare which means it use the want to do from where startat between and problem with a datetime field is that you really use it a compound index since the value is fairly for a compound index on going to allow you to search on only if you split the data between date and time you can index and search on it just an example for discussion you could obviously index on instead and it would but you may find yourself wanting to based on date plus another creating a compound index on that data would make it very

real problem is that documentation right not even close to how it is really through logging and looking through the code in the jmsreplication i was able to get it thing that tripped me up was once i realized it you have to implement your own key generator to ensure that ehcache saves the objects with the same keys on each that makes perfect when you think about you have to put in the loader queue information into the that is if you start up a process after one has been the new process can the cache from the existing configure the loader requester with the exact same	
	
really a hard and fast rule for this type of thing most experiments like to use at least 200 members in a population at the barest scaling up to millions or the number of generations is usually in the 100 to in to answer your final better to have lots of members in the population so that genes stay in a population long enough to and then use a smaller number of these the important most critical part of any ga is the fitness if you have a decent fitness function that accurately evaluates what you consider to be a level or a not going to end up with interesting results no matter how many generations you or how big your population is	
	
really an answer to you but you also instead of this is most often easier to write and makes the compiler look for in the right	
	
really are a couple things going on first thing you should look at is something like a compilers there are several old like the famous that are very i just discovered another one from the same guy who wrote the of assembly language on to write great only read the sample chapters so but it looks good and also seems to address just what you want without dropping immediately into the wonders of grammars and so is more programming in a systems programming you learn about using various system calls and other stuff to build useful you need to know that but a different track than it computer organization like the one aaronis refers is more about how the program gets from the assembly language level to actual gates and also called as the phrase was used when and brooks invented the instruction how and how you make quantitative choices in the design of the	
	
really be storing the age within the database as it is easily calculated and changes on a daily would suggest that you keep the date of birth field and just calculate the age as you need if you wish to have the age selected along with the other attributes then consider a perhaps with a user defined function to calculate the following is an example udf that you could function age declare select from where userid return within your queries you can do something similar to the as answer to your question on sorting then you could create a view on the data and use that to show the data so something like this view as can then use this view to perform your there could be a performance hit for filtering and sorting based on the age and if you regularly based upon the age field then you may want to create an indexed

really do because arrays in c are stored such that the elements of each row are stored that means a row of an array is a continuous block of and as far as c is concerned it might as well be an independent array it work the same way with columns because the elements of a column are not continuous in rather they are spaced at intervals of where each row is bytes this means that you could efficiently access the various of a column of a 2d array by using pointer but no way to actually make a column into an array itself other than by copying the elements over into a new	
	
really do it for all modes as there are indentation but you can set it it for all of the languages you care for something akin to the following in your should work for what you will set up tab stops at 4 characters and make 4 the default indentation level for all for other languages and their respective you have to look up their indentation variables and set them accordingly in that common some examples include and the easiest way to figure out what needs to be set is to should send you down the rabbit

really is a loaded the biggest issue you are probably facing is that has a terrible separation of concerns regarding backend and another thing that i would not be suprised to hear is that your html developers cringe when they see server control generated really does have some interesting this suggestion then may offer you no but this is what our company has and we were in the same boat as switched to an mvc your best choices in are of course the new mvc and mvc web frameworks allow a loose coupling between server logic and which allows you to create less standards because have much less crosstalk in your html developers will simply receive the data the page requires and then will be able to frame their markup around making it entirely possible that they not need to write any server and your server side developers will not need to create the biggest reason for diving into others code is to do something you need to do but as if you simplify your connection to be simple classes passed to the markup this crosstalk should be we as a company realized a much higher productivity level by switching to

really not sure how to approach but i am subscribing to events fired within a custom class and ideally i wish to queue them and handle them first in first out as they come i am aware of and i think i should use but my question is in the event handler when my message is would i simply to the queue and if then how can the queue be crunched through as new items are was considering calling a method in the constructor which performs something like on to your foreach item in there must be a more elegant way to do this should effectively hit myqueue and iterate as it contains elements and do what i want what would performance be i can spawn this on a separate thread to avoid any thread i just really have a had time accepting through list in a thread continually as it receives new	
	
really only one best be aware that strings and bytes are two fundamentally different and that whenever you convert between you are using a character encoding implicitly or which you need to pay attention problematic spots in the java api of these implicitly use the platform default which depends on the os and the locale a good idea to avoid this and explicitly declare an encoding in the above cases unfortunately so you have to use an your problems with the quotation marks and your use of a template engine may have a much simpler what program are you using to write your it sounds like one that inserts which are part of the cp1251 encoding but exist in the more global you probably need to do is to be aware which encoding your templates are saved and configure your template engine to use that encoding when reading in the also be aware that some texxt specifically explicitly declare the encoding in a and if that header disagrees with the actual encoding used by the invariable run into	
	
really ought to get a framework in place via a repository and identifying your dependencies up using the system scope is a common mistake people because they care about the dependency the trouble is that doing this you end up with a perverted maven build that will not show maven in a normal you would be better off following an approach like

really understand what conflict asking nor the problem with the fine to have two independent handles to the same thing i know that i learned in response to your question it that there is a new method on raises a new exception inside the generator to terminate the on receiving this the code must either raise or is called when a generator is so this means the code gets one last chance to run before the generator is this last chance means that statements in generators can now be guaranteed to the clause will now always get a chance to this seems like a minor bit of language but using generators and is actually necessary in order to implement the statement described by pep that handles the situation where a statement is used in a but it yields in the middle but never context method will be called when the generator is regards to the file handle i sometimes forget that there exist platforms that far as locks i think dowgird hits the head on the nail he just have to be aware that the generator is just like any other object that holds i think the statement is really that relevant since this function suffers from the same deadlock yield yield	
	
really want to learn c planning on joining an open source gnome what would be a good c

reason so hard to understand is not because a difficult concept but because syntax is int are first learned that the leftmost part of a variable creation defines the type of the pointer declaration does not work like this in c and instead they say that the variable is pointing on the type to the in this on an fully grasp pointers until i tried using them in they work in exact same way but with logical and consistent the pointer is a type here a pointer to an even get me started on function	
	
reason that does not allow you to rebind references is given in and evolution of is not possible to change what a reference refers to after that once a reference is initialized it cannot be made to refer to a different object it cannot be i had in the past been bitten by algol68 references where can either assign through to the object referred to or assign a new reference value to depending on the type of i wanted to avoid such problems in	
	
reason this is happening is that when an image is specified in a css and that image is missing the routing framework tries to map the url to a ignoring the routes as listed below will prevent the error from but i decided not to implement it because a nice way of being notified that you have a missing can see a detailed explanation along with examples of setting up dependency injection using structure map was having the same issue and i think i figured it for whatever reason whenever you try to provide your own controller factory you need to add a couple of additional ignoreroute the first thing i would do is add this line to your getcontrollerinstance return will at least give you more information in the error message as to what the request is that is causing the controllertype to be in my particular case i had a background image in my css file set like what happens is the routing is looking for a controller called and an action that takes or something along those obviously not the correct some digging i realized i needed to add an ignoreroute definition to my file that would ignore anything in the directory of my site like still not sure why you need to do this with the default but nonetheless it probably run into the same issue with particularly if you using google need to add this as new	
	
reason why your code work is due to how php handles indexed arrays inside you what php wanted to see single quotes this you only omit those single quotes if you are referencing a variable directly inside a that string such as can work with simple arrays but not with arrays of arrays unless you use curly braces note the single quotes in the curly exactly like normal string but rather more like referencing a variable elsewhere in	
	
reason you get for is probably because compiles in mode by default on mac os even on the easiest way to handle this is probably to push it off on the if they want a they can pass in to

recently had to update a relatively large control library that uses ninject to ninject to help resolve some issues i had with the update has gone well and i think ninject is a lot to try and avoid this problem in the future i have created my own interface for injecting fields and properties will essentially call methods on the ioc container i wish to use within the current web so now my control library is independant of any particular ioc container which will speed up any changes in that area in the was wondering has anyone else has done the same happy with what it has achieved but ideally i would like to update in my controls i create these injected fields often as protected and set them in the constructor for that problem i have with the above is that i have to use on all objects to actually set the property and i cannot use that on properties would prefer to do something along these lines but i think it is anyone got any ideas of how to neaten the code up or make it work in a cleaner i also would want to avoid attributes so it forces the developer to make a decision to inject the variable at a certain point within the thoughts and feelings are of control for your inversion of control

recently upgraded to vs 2008 on our users are still running the framework on and a upgrade is not in our near what we find out until already upgraded from 2005 to 2008 is that the crystal reports redistributables that come with vs 2008 only work on xp or now unable to edit our old reports because cr will automatically update it to the new i wound up doing is using our existing building a class that holds the report data of string and and serializing it to an xml insert an xsl stylesheet declaration that transforms it to and open it in wound up being quite a bit faster than crystal particularly for and i can typically have them just give me a word document of whatever the hell they want the report to look export it as clean it and then use that as a template for what the xsl nowhere near as as crystal but for what we need and lab reports and work	
	
recently was making a change to to our codebase from float to long for some and discovered that there were no error messages generated by the compiler in areas i knew were still this led me to add to the compiler this leads to some spurious error in the snippet i get errors as what can i do to supress this message on a or coax gcc into being smarter about the flag generates thousands of warnings in our code am i going to have to examine them float hello char float exit in function passing arg 1 of as rather than due to gcc specs from version 20060404 hat pointed out by john the flag is working had thought it was about but it turns out about converting really old programs to a reading of the gcc page for my version of gcc give me but in any what i really want is some other warning flag to enable that will warn correctly in the folowing and not give spurious long float char float long no warnings warnings exit real solution is to upgrade my not something the company is willing to do for complicated reasons do i turn off erroneous error messages from

reference to which was excellent only described the when and where to use the another part of the answer is why are they needed many languages get along just fine without when designing aspects of the delphi object pascal oop oriented had been in the mainstream for several during this time it was observed that using many of the languages that had adopted those concepts to develop application frameworks suffered from what i called the you developed an awesome framework using language x and released it as version your users raved at all it could do and it became heavily flush with you decide to release version 2 with even more you specifically made sure it was fully backward you users started reporting strange their own virtual methods were being called at strange many reported that their old code would not compile with the new all the same and functionality still all you did was add a few virtual methods to some base some new object and some new optional what override and reintroduce directives serve to eliminate this problem by requiring that in order to actually a virtual method you must use the override directive in place of the virtual if you happen to introduce your own virtual method that has the same name as one of your virtual the compiler now warns but will still do the right in this using not only suppresses that it also serves to document in the source you intended to do the override and reintroduce you would not be able to continually evolve your framework without fear of breaking all your and if your users had to make massive modifications every time a new version is then they would be loathe to adopt the new using also allows the framework designer to change the type of virtual in the ancestors without breaking user for in delphi many methods are marked which is a runtime method lookup form of perform quite as fast as a regular virtual so it is usually used for methods that are rarely overridden are responses to user actions where the extra overhead is never suppose in v1 of the framework a method was marked but in practice it ended up being overridden and called more than you in you could change it to without fear of code being object pascal language the only language to recognize this requires the use of an directive for the exact same the standards committee is finally recognizing the problem and are modifying the language to support sort in if a name and parameter list matches an then it is an override if you say on the for the upcoming new if you specify and the signatures match then it is a new virtual method introduced on current if there is a signature match with the ancestor and the writer intend to then the keyword is used to tell the compiler that this is a virtual for this	
	
references represent the variable you make a reference to a you thinking of it as way of accessing the you should think of it as being the variable would you reset a and what use would it the problem is in your point to the same do not they just so happens they are implemented using for op missing the point of did you read a reference is an just another way of accessing the same a main have a class that takes up 500 mb of so copying this class is too which means a not an since the original class will be copied onto the stack and the function so in we did is the class is not copied and we can still access but the problem is if we check for doing lots of functions return if function was passed the the point of references you need to copy the but you also can have a you need to check for null because it cannot yet got the you have an to the not a copy or reseating them would be how would the syntax references are not like they point to an there anything to change about a reference because a reference a the reference itself takes no the address of the reference is the address of the along with the just another way of getting some sure what else to when people do strange like another answer but if something does that they deserve a

relational database paradigm makes some assumptions about usage of relation consists of an unordered set of rows in a relation have the same set of column has a fixed name and data type and semantic meaning on all in a relation are identified by unique values in primary key assumptions support simplicity and at the cost of some not all data management tasks fit into this kind of entities with complex attributes or variable attributes do for if you need flexibility in areas where a relational database solution support you need to use a different kind of are other solutions for managing data with different semantic web for allows each entity to define its own attributes and to be by treating metadata as attributes just like this is more flexible than the structure imposed by a relational but that flexibility comes with a cost of its you should use the right tool for each also my other answer to

run a run a start an executable is any file with executable you just specify it by its make a script give it the necessary a file is the is responsible for figuring out how to execte for this is done by looking at the first line of the it should contain a hashbang tells the kernel what program to run this case the command is ran with the argument the script is passed to the program second along with all the arguments you gave the script as subsequent means script that is executable should have a if it not telling the kernel what it and therefore the kernel know what program to use to interprete it could be or something the kernel will often use the default shell to interprete the which is very dangerous because it might not be the right interpreter at all or it might be able to parse some of it but with subtle behavioural differences such as is the case between and note on see hash bangs like result is that the kernel will run the program to interpret the is not always shipped by and it is not always available in while on linux machines it usually there are a range of other posix machines where ships in various such as or write a portable bash we can therefore not rely on the location of the posix already has a mechanism for dealing with the idea is that you install your programs in one of the directories that are in and the system should be able to find your program when you want to run it by you just do kernel do a search for there is a program that can do a search for called nearly all systems have an program installed in so we start using a hardcoded which then does a search for and runs it so that it can interpret your approach has one according to the hashbang can have in this we use as the argument to the that means we have no space left to pass arguments to so no way to convert something like to this have to put after the hashbang approach also has another some systems may ship with a but the user may not like may find buggy or and may have installed his own somewhere this is often the case on os x where apple ships an outdated and users install an using something like when you use the approach which does a you take the preference into account and use his preferred bash over the one his system shipped

schemas are often identified with a uri and while they may be formatted similarly there is no guarantee that there is anything there because it is not a ability to identify the correct xml schema is necessary if you must validate an xml a means of identification must be shared between the content and the schema authors before successful validation can mean anything uris fill this need as good as anything keep in mind that the schema is not necessarily needed in order to make use of the xml therefore it does not need to be universal locatable or it simply needs to be the semantics of a uri avoid the implication that the resource must be located as would be the case with a and with good such a detail is irrelevant to the task of publishers will often base the uri off of a url which they i can imagine there are many reason for doing but for it helps avoid naming conflicts without an when using such a convention it is hard to resist hosting the definition at the location the uri would point to if it where a while by know means i believe doing so marks an appreciated and is an example of good information but this fact remains unrelated to needs filled by a

second part of the question is the most interesting one to i prefer to put within the classes that use when a logical place for even if used in other but that causes some problems with forward declarations we use heavily for in one recent project we had a class called with an embedded typedef called which made for very readable code an is very clear and but whenever we wanted to use the we had to include the declaration of the even if all we needed was the declaration of since no way i know to a type within a that we ended up doing it both we created a global and then to it that our code have to be not the prettiest but it got the job for the other use any special convention for the for we often use unlikely that ever change from a map to some other container but if is descriptive enough and conflict with an existing often use it generally bother creating typedefs for the since easy very to simply use or that we sometimes typedef them if the type name is so long that makes the code look too know of any better way to say but you probably know what i create different typedefs for each even if two of them define exactly the same they can change independent of one so having different type names for them simplifies any later it also makes for more readable in many

short answer is you can play a if you can always do something like enum enum a b c it work all that great because can always do something like static class public static t consume where t return order to cross between base and could also cast the values of the enums as and compare them as ints instead of but that kind of sucks extension method return should type cast it type

short answer unless you manually write such a routine is often not a bad but it has the usual problems of getting out of sync with the class if you are members this is unavoidable because lacks any form of introspection into you decide to go that the best thing to do is to write an overload for myclass which will enable your class to be printed to any iostreams output

simplest and safest option is to include the generation in the build as fionn code is always slow as this will mean at each compile that you the source and then rebuild all as the generated code as option is to manually regenerate the code and if you have a build integration rebuild the code files each faster if there are few changes out of date generated and hours of wasted debugging trying to solve the project it seems that you need a plugin that provides the custom tool action you but in projects you can define your own custom step so you could develop a visualstudio plugin find or add a project to your and add a custom build step to that and then include the output in your normal first google for studio custom tool code has a write your own custom which would be a good starting

so a array is just a grouping of useful if got a lot of and you like to save time and the same as now the computer knows what talking about and you can write something to n a two dimensional array is somewhat more but can be thought of as an array of so we could have something like of of of equivalent declaration in pascal to the above a array is a so for if arraya contains the grades of a student in 50 then arrayb represents the grades of a bunch of would be the grade of the third student on class number easy to expand the same logic to add another dimension to the of could say that c represents a so is the grade of the second schools fourth student in class what are arrays used storing groups of similar or information need to be processed in in mostly be using a at most dimensional if you can imagine your data as a almost definitely want an for how else would you represent a chess if you had arrays tend to be used but what if you had to save some sort of state for each of your table something of the third value is 1 if some condition is true for a given and 0 of a trivial but another way of understand arrays more

so the short answer is the longer answer is you kind with a bit of hosting this outside of iis actually reasonable to load the configuration section itself and parse as you can cast it to the wcf configuration servicemodelgroup as messy but it does the problem comes with iis iis hosted services inherit their address from iis and will ignore fully qualified addresses in any configuration you can you could use a custom service host this does mean changing your service startup in either code or the file for a custom service host factory deriveds from and overrides override servicehost you can see getting one or more uri objects containing the addresses of your at this point you can store them somewhere lookup table against the service type and then query that in your file you need to change it just a for

solution is to override those styles with another named the new style would need to appear after the style for the table noted within the file of precedence for css is where it appears in the having a specific style for that control would prevent other styles from doing the same thing in the wrote this placed it at the end of the file and wrapped my entire fieldtemplate contorl in nowrap solid 0 0 0 0 0 table tr solid 0 0 0 to the to everything not be the default file will be updated in subsequent

some internal about instead doing some kind encryption passwords first thing we need to address is data in transit data at from the op it sounds like the big concern is in the clear over the you really care about data in https via ssl is a tested method of doing this a pretty easy if you really want to roll your own for data at rest a on a file a different but the existing methods for data encryption are going to be better than a roll your on the client side for your security is in a corporate you can somewhat rely on a standard users are dumb and you may run into someone disabling javascript or whatever client based solution you roll so they end up sending the in plain text anyway if your servers know what to do with it because not in the expected is not going to be subject to the scrutiny that an existing solution you could end up adding additional security issues into the mix because of the

some languages chars just other languages chars exist and have distinct like or has mostly been on the side of but at times has seemed to not be entirely sure of this if you want chars as a data ruby already assigns meaning to and so seems about as reasonable as any other option for char simply a matter of saying what you you could just as well say but using an integer when you really mean a using a string when you mean a character looks equally strange to the set of operations they support is almost completely one is a sequence of the you make take a list of and just happen to only look at the first you omit from a language just because you already support of lisp did just that church numerals for but performance was so this was one of the huge advances of lisp that made it usable as a real back in

sounds like working within a framework that was designed by someone else where you have services and a and now that you have all this stuff looking at the big pile of code and asking there an easier the short answer is there is always an easier there are as many different ways of doing data access as there are the model using is fairly complex and sounds like it follows the principles of domain driven ddd is a great methodology and it provides excellent separation of concerns and high but it also requires a lot of plumbing code and not well understood by most programmers so getting help can be i do think the best way to build enterprise but not the best model for you to follow if new to doing a small project you might want to consider bypassing the bll no services no just have a common that contains your entity classes and build a dll that contains data access methods that directly populate and save your even simpler approach is to do away with the entity classes and just have your dll return datatables that contain your entity this approach looses the strong typing of an entity class but it is much easier to approach is to use entity ef will do all of this for you and it will generate strongly typed entity it does take a little while to get used to ef but once you understand how to work with it can drastically reduce the time it takes you to write persistence for some good tutorials on check out blog

sounds like you might be trying to describe a message authentication code takes a message a and the secret and data are hashed and the result is included with the message recipient who knows the secret can perform the same digest and compare his mac to the one that accompanied the received if they are he can trust that the message was not your i understand now that you are working with asymmetric rather than a secret which would be used in a still a little a private signature key is kept secret by its which in this case seems to be the a client can cryptographically prove that they possess a private key that corresponds to a public key without disclosing the private digital you can do something like is the private is its public the parameter is the data that gets if i understand your application i should be the client then is a message format that bundles and its signature your question is confusing because is used both generating and verifying a shared nothing in this scheme in the mac to stop one client from using value of all you can do with such a technique is to ensure that the message content has not been for if the message is something like you can make sure that mallory substitute his own ip address for if the message is just you stop alice from giving bob her message return for splitting the cost of a and you control whether mallory hacks into box and steals the the if message integrity really is all you and you can easily share a secret between the sender and a macs have some nice advantages over such as much smaller message size and faster the threats you are trying to defend cryptography is devising untried schemes usually ends

sounds like you want to have the delegate methods received by multiple on mac os the solution is to use the notification i looked at the but it looks like it only supports a delegate out of the are great because they let an object broadcast information to any other objects that are interested in receiving objects register themselves with the notification center to be notified when particular notifications are you could very easily add this capability by implementing your own class to wrap what write your own class that has an as an instance you would set this class as the delegate for the when the delegate methods get you would post notifications to the probably need to stuff the parameters from the delegate methods into the the flip your view controllers would sign up with the as observers for the notifications your custom class every time the delegate methods each view controller will receive a notification of that some nsstring mysocketwrapper nsobject give this class a better name asyncsocket the asyncsocketdidreaddata if return socket initialize this however you return nsdictionary in your various view you can write code like if return do any initalization you need note that if you specify for be sent notifications for every mysocketwrapper return asyncsocket nsdata long tag do what you want with the data this code entirely and i may have gotten some method names wrong doing this from but this is a solution that should work for

standard does not define there are a number of ways to invoke undefined behavior in a program all of which may corrupt your stack after the short answer is your question is too vague to have a meaningful	
	
standard interfaces provide an update you have use a custom type that implements although the complexity of algorithms that use a heap change when you remove and replace the top of the their actual run time can nearly like to see better support for a and style of heap	
	
standard is there in the open so that the browsers who do not confirm to the standard may look and the standard is important because it is the only way by which you can hope to make a webpage that will display correctly on all remember that a standard that is developed is never for the it is only for the if in the past some browsers did not confirm to the standard it mean that we should not have fact the standard is born because the browsers were all doing their own thingie and there was then a need for the you code to the standard the browsers will confirm to a hope	
	
standard know this thingy used by but it says the type should have the natural size for a execution but even for 64 bit int is usually only 32 so in standard terms has pretty much no common meaning for the common english of size is the size of a depends on what character you talk character types are unsigned char and signed also is used to store characters that can have any size by the implementation but must use one of the integer types as its underlying much like while char or unsigned char has to have one that means that one byte has as much bits as one char if an implementation says one object of type char has 16 then a byte has 16 bits a byte is the size that one char a not some specific there is not much more about just that it is the unit that you can access you do not have pointer access to but you have access to units starting at one now is pretty what do you all of long and their unsinged counterparts are their range is what i would call and it is documented in the c standard taken over by the for signed char the range is from for short and int it is the same and is and for long it is their unsigned counterparts range from 0 up to and those are however minimal that an int may not have maximal size on any because that is less than of it follows for those values that a minimum of bits is for char that is for that is 16 and for long that is representation for negative numbers is not which is why the negative value is not instead of for example for signed

standard mechanism use to represent the data is a data transfer i would never return a linq to sql or entity framework object across a service and i would hesitate to return it across a layer boundary of any this is because these objects will serialize

standard way to write test scenarios is probably in use case or user story google should give you plenty of links to choose from if you want to know more about just provide some more leads for you to investigate your question is kind of java and there is it allows you to write test scenarios in a sort of and the tests can be could look into driven which has caused development of some frameworks to write executable user for example for ruby seems to be very is a list of such frameworks for many other

starting a process from a java i hold onto it and at later points in the program i may send it some signals as in unix signals a different to tell it to clean itself up and shut which is the proper way of terminating this i may later restart and hold onto the process and stop it again an arbitrary number of like my when it to signal the process to terminate and make sure it since java starts the process up it persists and continues to run after my program thought i would do this in the destructor for the object that contains the process but it seems that java does not have a it has a method for freeing memory allocated through but this is not such a and apparently you guarantee that will be it is only called when the object is garbage and the program might run through to termination without ever calling garbage in which case everything is freed at once and no garbage collection and no the best way to make sure that when my program exits this cleanup code gets called see that java has introduced a but i am currently stuck on java do i cleanup an opened process in

suspicion is that you are trees is a local variable in a function you do not have to retain in that case if spritewithfile is returning a sprite with an section on delay release in the documentation discusses this the long and short of it is that the receiver of the autorelease is guaranteed to have the object be valid for the duration of its if you need the object beyond the scope of the function trees is a property of a then in that case you need a retain just synthesize a property configured to issuing the extra it is likely that your retain count is always too high reaches and hence your object is not garbage good suggest this paragraph as well that talks about the validity of

terms of memory these two classes are virtually several other responders have suggested that there is a difference between the two in that one is allocating storage on the stack and other on the but not necessarily and even in the cases where it is terribly in all different is where the for the is the actual underlying storage in the is allocated from the heap a little bit tricky to see this because using so the specific implementation details are but is implemented like vector if int int t you can the class itself only has a few members size and a pointer to a dynamically allocated block of memory that will store the actual contents of the your the only difference is where the storage for those few fields comes in the first the storage is allocated from whatever storage you use for your containing class if it is heap so too will be those few bits of the if your container is stack so too will be those few bits of the the second those bits of the are always heap both the actual of the the contents of it are allocated from the and you cannot change else has pointed out already that you have a memory leak in your second and that is also make sure to delete the vector in the destructor of your container

that comparable is also a generic parameterized by what type it is comparable the most way to declare your mergesort function above extends super enforces that the type compareto method can accept an argument of type a type could implement but not be comparable to like implements so it is important to have the requirement on the type parameter of in any comparable class should be comparable to at least require that extends super instead of just extends because it is okay if a type method accepts a more general type than because it would still be able to accept an argument of type this is important if you have a class which implements and then you have a subclass b which extends b cannot implement because b already implements inherited from and a class cannot implement an interface so if we required extends b would not satisfy and we would not be able to sort

the an inline box contains an the inline box its inline ancestors within the same line are broken around the box any siblings that are consecutive or separated only by collapsible whitespace splitting the inline box into two boxes if either side is one on each side of the the line boxes before the break and after the break are enclosed in anonymous block and the box becomes a sibling of those anonymous when such an inline box is affected by relative any resulting translation also affects the box contained in the inline model would apply in the following example if the following inline block used with this html html public html text interrupted by a this is anonymous text before the is the content of this is anonymous text after the p element contains a chunk of anonymous text followed by a element followed by another chunk of anonymous the resulting boxes would be a block box representing the containing an anonymous block box around the span block and another anonymous block box around properties of anonymous boxes are inherited from the enclosing box in the example just below the subsection heading block the one for properties have their initial for the font of the anonymous box is inherited from the but the margins will be set on elements that cause anonymous block boxes to be generated still apply to the boxes and content of that for if a border had been set on the p element in the above the border would be drawn around c1 at the end of the and c2 at the start of the user agents have implemented borders on inlines containing blocks in other by wrapping such nested blocks inside line and thus drawing inline borders around such as css1 and css2 did not define this and user agents may implement this alternative model and still claim conformance to this part of css this does not apply to uas developed after this specification was of that what you clearly the behaviour is specified in although whether it covers all or is implemented consistently across browsers is

the answer you get will be off by a certain i have never heard of a timer function compensating for the average return because such a thing is nearly impossible to predict such things are usually implemented by simply reading a register in the hardware and returning the or a version of it scaled to the appropriate i lose sleep over the accepted way of keeping this overhead from affecting your measurements in any significant way is to use these timers for short you will time several or million executions of the same and divide by the number of executions to estimate the average such a thing is usually more useful than timing a single as it takes into account average cache os and so

the getting of the controllers and actions seems to me to be the relatively trivial the hard part is being able to get all the possible parameter values that you might want to show in the urls of your if you have a url pattern like then not going to be able to determine through reflection what the meaning of or the possible the best you can do is determine the system occurred to me as i was looking at this is that a sitemap is really just another view of your so one random thought i had was that if you inherit from a base controller in your and you have a method on that base controller that has to be actionresult you could create a which calls each of the other controllers in the solution and asks them for their and then renders them all together in one final sort of a composite though not a concept been added to this framework

the sense that a code smell is an indicator of a potential need for refactoring are private methods a code was looking at some of my own code and it dawned on me that many of my public methods actually do anything other than consolidate private methods of the same none of the private methods relied on any member got me thinking and i started looking through other everywhere i looked was the same private methods with little or no dependence on data in the class they were defined struck me that these private methods really belong to the classes they were of course extracting them to new classes would mean making them public so there was no point to them being private in the first this universal to all private methods or have i just not looked long enough to find private methods that look like they belong in the class their from the responses the general consensus on this site seems to be that they are i was curious if there were some who i stumbled across a on that brings up some interesting any case it seems that by themselves private methods really indicate any particular opportunity for thanks for all the private methods in general a code

the solution looking foos bars for x in recommend using a list comprehension for x in over using map as it avoids the overhead of a function call on every iteration can be very if just going to use it in a for get better speeds by using a generator y for x in for z in print difference is that the generator comprehension is in response to this course you that you copy all entries are the same bars so if you modify any one of them original you modify all of suppose this is a valid there are two solutions to this that i can think the most efficient is probably something like for x in tuples are this will prevent bars from being modified through the results of this list comprehension generator comprehension if you go that if you really need to modify each and every one of the you can do copy import for x in this can be a bit expensive both in terms of memory usage and in so recommend against it unless you really need to add to each one of

the specific requirement to provide a library of objects shipped with the application a database system is probably not the right thing that springs to mind is that you probably want the file to be updatable you need to be able to drop and updated file into the application without changing the rest of the thing is that the data shipping is immutable for this purpose therefore you need the capabilities of a relational just to be able to access a particular model with adequate simplicity an xml file would do nicely as got good using that as a basis you can then choose to compress encrypt embed it as a resource in an assembly one were playing in if sqlite stores its data in a single file and if you have other reasons to need the capabilities of a db in you storage system then but want to think about the utility of the db to the app as a whole

the the async attribute is for the case where your page is going to call some task that also blocks the and then your page needs the output from that task in order to return info to the for if your page needed to call a web wait for its and then use the data from the response to render your reason use the async attribute is to avoid blocking the this is important because applications use a thread pool to serve and there are only a relatively small number of threads and if each call ties up the thread while waiting on the web service then soon going to hit enough concurrent users that users are going to have to wait until these web service calls the async attribute lets the thread return to the thread pool and serve other concurrent visitors to your web rather than forcing it to sit still doing nothing while waiting for the web service call to upshot for you is the async attribute is designed for the case where you render the page until the asynchronous task and why it render the page need to launch your own and make it a daemon i remember the exact syntax for but you can easily find it in the doc by searching the bcl doc for this means the thread will keep your application from shutting down while it is which is important because and iis reserve the right to your when they deem it and if that happens while your thread is your task will be making the thread daemon will prevent this for some possible rare edge cases find out more when you find the documentation on daemon thread is where you will kick off these and after told the daemon thread to do the you can immediately render your page so the rendering of the page will happen better than a daemon thread in your would be to implement a windows service for doing the have your application communicate the task to be performed to the no need for a daemon thread and no need to worry about your process being how do you tell the service to do the perhaps through or perhaps by inserting a record into a database table that the service or a number of other another which i have used before for this very same write the info about your task into an msmq have another process even on another pull from that queue and do the the job of inserting into a queue is optimized to return as quickly as so your thread block while the data you put in the queue is sent across the wire or anything like it is one of the fastest ways to make note of the fact that a task needs to be done without waiting for that task to

the the difference between a project and an an app is a web application that does something a weblog a database of public records or a simple poll a project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular web a project can contain multiple an app can be in multiple versus is really more of a separate but understanding the distinction django draws between a and an is a big part of good code roughly this is what the two terms application tries to provide a relatively set of related an application is allowed to define a set of models it have and to define and register custom template tags and filters it have project is a collection of installed into the same and all using the same settings in a the defining aspect of a project is that it supplies a settings file which specifies the database to the applications to and other bits of a project may correspond to a single web but have to multiple projects can run on the same the project is also responsible for the root url though in most cases useful to just have that consist of calls to include which pull in url configurations from inidividual custom custom context processors and most other things django lets you create can all be defined either at the level of the project or of the and where you do that should depend on most effective for in best placed inside an application increases their portability across

there a reason that you want to avoid using the data binding it handles keeping parity between the value and the property value and provides rich can interface with the data binding engine in two either programatically or through the to do basic data binding programatically is say i have a class named with a string property named i have a textbox named mytxtbox on a form with an instance of fooclass called foo and i want to bind it to the mystring this will cause updates to the textbox to get assigned to the and changes to the property from elsewhere will be reflected in the more complex data binding probably want to create an object data source in your project and put a bindingsource on your if you need help with specific steps in creating the data source i can but in general create the source in your project and select the class to which you want to you can then place a bindingsource on your point it at your object project data then use the visual studio designer to bind properties for your controls to properties on your you then set the datasource property in your code to an instance of the class or collection to which you want to a side as far as i am aware there is no as properties are actually function pairs and a i read your like to point out that data even at the control does not automatically use data binding is built around type descriptors and property both for the bound control and the data true that if one or both of these sides does not implement specific property and type description then reflection will be but either side is more than free to provide its own description profile which would not use

there is a why see in msdn it will often say class is threadsafe for static something like it means when ms wrote the they intentionally used synchronization primitives to make the static members this is common when writing libraries and because it is easier to make static members threadsafe than instance because you know what the library user is going to want to do with if they made instance members threadsafe for many of the library they would put too many restrictions on you so often they let you handle you likewise need to make your static members threadsafe document that they the static are threadsafe in a the clr will make sure they are called only once and will prevent 2 threads from getting into a static marc pointed out in the comments an edge case in which static constructors are not if you use reflection to explicitly call a static apparently you can call it more than so i revise the statement as as long as you are relying on the clr to decide when to call your static then the clr will prevent it from being called more than and it will also prevent the static ctor from being called

thing that helps a lot is to find a good balance between focussing and not sure you can work on the bug without being also know when to take a break if you cannot concentrate any there is a point where a good night of sleep is the best you can discuss the problem with a often a second pair of eyes and point of view work	
	
thing that like to add to previous answers is that if you do not want to embrace mvc at all you can use the mvp pattern to separate concerns using a nice article from phil good thing about the mvp pattern is that you can work in a way that you can switch the presentation logic from to winforms or even	
	
thing to consider is since there is no multiple if you want a class to be able to from your but inherit from another base use an	
	
thing to is that validation schemes such as the one you describe should not take place purely on the client javascript is for it is possible for somebody to submit unvalidated if this the server side code will use it and the condition that you are testing for will go backup client side validation with the same validation on the	
	
thing to remember about except is that really just an extension to so if you are looking for help on writing expect scripts and your question is not related to one of the expect specific you should try looking in the tcl a good starting place is as well as are two ways to do what trying to and may be used when you are adding an integer value to another it is very fast for that for value does not work with and it do anything but addition subtraction if you negate the as in value if you need something more you should use value value the use of curly braces around the although they are not required for correct operation in they improve if you are doing many arithmetic using braces around the expressions will significantly improve the performance of your for more see you should get in the habit of bracing your expressions when using can find links to several expect resources at	
	
thing using select from select from mytable where name union select from mytable where phone union select from mytable where email union select from mytable where address some group by mytable entry in my for performance	
	
thing very interesting support is very good with fast report team ask one question and you get your answer very quickly you can also ask for some improvement and if it look stupid they made if you need olap solution you can get fast cube and generate report	
	
thing you can try is taking the fft of your 1d line and then removing later for in matlab i did the truncate to 250 tended to happen was that the peaks of the ifft of f were very close to peaks of they necessarily the highest points of but they were for this there were peaks at and 725 in the inverted fft of and there were also peaks in y at and global max was at which was a peak in but not a very high this only really cuts your data usage in because i converted 1000 doubles into 250 complex a further increase can be obtained by only using the real part of the only uses the space still yielded pretty good with each major peak of corresponding to a peak in y that was only at most a distance of 2 away most of the and you use the space of storing the double this still get you the results of or two double you are now packing 2500 doubles into you can experiment by cutting more but you will have to test more values by cutting more maybe you can keep the first of and find the and then look within a distance of 3 or this would reduce your 2500 doubles to a only testing will find out what works best for your you can go as low as the lowest and search 5 or 6 in either direction for the true but this still leaves you with 25 think any way to convert 2500 doubles into only 1 or and have it reversible into anything take a look at information theory texts to see suggest you get gnu or even and play around with something like this and find what results are best for	
	
thing you could do is create several different methods for methods with no one for methods with one like static void static void t static void t u you can have a private method which actually does the similarly to your current but not exposed to client static void params edit this code to run it on the background report client code will call one of the public methods which will enforce the requirement that the right number and types of arguments are	
	
thing you could do is make the primary key this results in the actual data being physically ordered on the resulting in faster will also mean slower but if you select much more frequently than you this should not be a	
	
thing you could do is to have a seperate settings file just for your then you only have to have a reference to it in your entry apps config the in for information on	
	
things come to just because you received an email with a plain text password mean stored in plain we and email out in plain bad but a step up from plain use a password manager if worried about this type of you control other password bad what you can control is your good practices and the damage done if one of your passwords is use it has a password generator that you can modify the rules to so that you can have super obscure passwords specific to the	
	
think a common practice for is to just generate it dynamically as part of the build rather than keeping a static file you can use any settings you believe nant has an task for this guessing something similar for msbuild as or you could just write a custom file generation script and use it to shove a custom into your	
	
think a config value you can put in the appsettings section of your to turn on internal debug statements in will give you some insight into any errors that log4net might be	
	
think a pity support const correctness as of all parameters i pass to a function are constant the const feature guarantees that the data you pass by reference be modified after the the keyword provides which is a great help in large	
	
think a point to testing simple property getters and the point of is not to verify that your compiler as soon as you add a or other behavior to your getters and setters other i think appropriate to add unit	
	
think a query like this should have to pivot the results yourself on the display though this query gets the results have to display them when calllength between 0 and 15 then calllength else 0 as when calllength between 16 and 30 then calllength else 0 as after the putting case statements up to 86400 is probably out of the oh well	
	
think about it in terms of with is because it you easily an american flag shop unless you expanded your company to make all the is because when you go to the in there is very different food there than there is the also all written in this means they have adjusted their product to the language culture of localization is when you make specific products for different for and they are both one is for the us and one is for new they are both in but they are localized to the of their respective that make	
	
think all code came from entry by far as alternatives to it all depends on your gridview is the best for tabular if you want more flexibility with the layout consider	
	
think all putting it before or after matter except against a very specific threat fact that there is supposed to defeat rainbow threat model i alluded to would be the scenario where the adversary have rainbow tables of common salts to the the guessing they either have it appended or prepended but not and a poor be better to assume that they have the capacity to store these rainbow but tables with strange salts interspersed in the middle of the in narrow i would conjecture that interspersed would be i pick a different salt per a long and include odd characters in it like symbols and ascii	
	
think and i think that an updated version would be that much timing figures would be different as the testing machine would probably be newer and but the relation between the tests would be pretty much the article is about the low level effects of common operations in managed and that changed much since the artice was the new versions of the framework has added a lot of but all built on the primitives that has been available since	
	
think another way is to build a custom notifier for like the i just began a custom teamcity notifier on google code so simple to the main

think be able to remove or change the part of the class you can build a new which is possible at runtime but a little hibernate may support programmatic access to the validations and allow you to override the i know the api that hibernate does a bit of runtime class building that might be a good place to learn how to do it if	
	
think confused about what to initialize class there is no and thus there are no instance to initialize an override the	
	
think confusing your operator precedence and of you want to say in c the has a higher so your expression as it is and or my speed is lower than you have an extra pair of which suggests that you intended to prioritize things mention that code that has a bunch of similar looking if statements is fairly poorly a better way to implement it would be either with tables or data structures to represent the or at least a better that posted the it really looks like working too hard on of if or switch based on year should only be about 4 for each call a separate function to do the that will already be return return know but there should be some sort of switch you can manage each year your conditions are in an ascending order of you could do something return return return return is still far from but it will already be a lot cleaner and looking at your it looks like you even need that many you are paying 50 why not just calculate the diff and then just return the result of the know just guessing at the	
	
think default java serialisation is going to be pretty can you not usefully restrict what you want to serialise via the keyword that would address your third issue and

think given quite enough context for anybody to figure out at least need to see the entire command the not the right place to ask about this is possibly on the macports mailing list or irc each macports package has a who is likely the most knowledgeable person about that

think hit the nail on the head with your last if not every has a then you can gain memory saving by using a pointer for those without a is unlikely to be really useful unless the cumulative size of all the unused is a sizable proportion of the available i would change your statement to read not all instances of will have exactly one copy of for the following reason this is the other case asking is a node in a list also holds a pointer to another or i would make it a pointer you could still embed the first node all had to have at least one other possibility is sharing among the if their nature permits it as being a windows on a screen although have to the in that case so as to know when to finally free them in your calls of being able to reuse an in your

think it is or should be you use inheritance so that b extends you should be able to use a b object as an a for this would be obj new the program has no way of knowing that you call some of public without redefinition of functions is	
	
think it is particularly common to find genetic algorithms in they are more commonly found in code where the need to find the is less important than the need to just find a good solution to a i have consulted on a couple of commercial projects that do use gas as a result of my involvement with i think the most interesting example was at a biotech they used the ga to optimise scoring functions that were used for virtual as part of their drug discovery this with my i added a new feature to one of our products that uses another i think we might be marketing this from next the ga is used to explore molecules that have the potential for binding to a and could therefore be further investigated as drugs targeting that a competing product that also uses a ga is	
	
think it is to assume that it is a i perfectly write my own and your implementation would choke on breaking the whole point of you also just change the api to accept explicit implementation to support since i could be using the interface rather than the visitor new you want optional support for something from the then you are going to have to use to detect anything else and you are breaking the

think it is worth knowing and there are reasons to choose close to the whole stack is sometimes you need to debug sometimes you cannot fix a performance problem without knowledge is often the when the performance problem is purely but it is widely considered the quintessential of the and not some other i think this because c is a programming it has been a while but c was not always as to take just one famous the proponents of common lisp had its own ways of writing were hoping their language would be and eventually following are usually implemented in systems many embedded operating programming languages popular implementations of reams of popular open source not a hardware but i gather that c has influenced cpu design if you believe in understanding the whole learning c from a pragmatic the best a i think worth learning as although c is close to the i fully understand c until i had to do some it is occasionally helpful to understand how functions calls are actually how loops are less but also is having to least deal with a system without virtual when using c on and certain other operating even humble does a lot of work under the covers that is easier to debug tune if ever had to deal with manually locking and unlocking memory regions that i would recommend doing so on a regular

think it really depends on the use there are several types of classes for which operators are a for smart pointers would be worthless without the and also find the equality and assignment operators to be very useful for specific i work in an editor environment and as such we naturally have several times for representing coordinates and sure we could do everything with a comparison operator but point1 point2 looks loads better 0 find less use for the other operators although cast occasionally comes in	
	
think it would have helped you to get answers if abstracted the problem so that it rely on the neodatis db interface that threw me for a as never used what written below about it is based on a very cursory that never used groovy though i like what seen of but seeing as no one else has answered stuck with me think the problem at least part of may be that expecting too much of the simplenativequery class from it look like it even tries to filter the objects before it adds them to the returned i think instead you want to use the in the package this has me a bit as i know for sure if this class is meant to be used by but i see any other classes in neodatis that allow for query criteria to be instead of using criteriaquery i think rather wrap it inside of a groovy class so that you can use it with i think a groovy version of your code with closures might look something like create a class that wraps criteriaquery and allows you to pass this is wordy but at least groovycriteriaquery extends criteriaquery private final i prefer to check for null instead of in if throw new be c public boolean assuming here that can be used as the object instance at least as proxy for may have to extract the actual object from aoi before calling return now use the query class in some random src new hope this

think my first question would be how savvy are you with you really elude to that in your your using excel there are ways to hide menu commands in excel and remove a lot of the current interface and replace it with your it looks like excel and functions like the ribbon interface looks vastly the other side is just to add a tab or menu and have your commands it sounds like you want use excel as your but replace the commands with your you want to hide your and you decide vba is the way to then your code is stored inside the excel spreadsheet and is accessible to anyone who knows how to open the vba you decide to do it in then your functionality exists in an assembly outside and the runtime loads it when you open the no amount of poking around inside excel will help them find your are lots of code samples to help you with i would recommend if you decide to do from a pure syntax handles lots of the office programming well and can help you speed here is the development that you can go and get information before making a according to this you need to buy visual studio professional 2008 or 2005 to get the graphical designers and if this feasible or vba might not be a bad idea to start

think of it this way the username is the way of figuring out which account a user is trying to login the password is the way of figuring out whether the user is actually allowed to login as that in this means going to look up a row in your accounts table using the username as an by encrypting the simply making it harder to find the right if using the same encryption scheme to encrypt the username and they are pretty much equally secure if you can break you can break the encrypting both makes it harder to lookup the but add any additional in your question you talk about decrypting your password you probably want to make this impossible most people encrypt their passwords using a hash function of some sort and sha256 are along with a the part simply means that once you run something through the you use what you get out to get what you started if you start with the same always get the same the salt is a secret that only your application knows of like an encryption which is added to whatever you are before it is run through the this makes it impossible to do things like match two encrypted passwords from two different sites using different	
	
think off your see recurring for something even more	
	
think once one wraps head around the idea that mvc uses routing to direct requests straight to classes use a model for connections and a view for rather than showing the concept of mvc in a web application really presents itself more with the of out of the a lot easier to consider those attributes and make a decision whether mvc is suited to a particular having said if i were new to i would probably tackle the forms version first and get a good understanding of and the methodology of that system before going into mvc because mvc is really handled on top of that 2 i think i got voted down before finishing my edits	
	
think one solution would be to put on controller that would check and accept headers of think got the right idea	
	
think overestimating the complexity of being you need to store the 3d models for the or their or any of the things that make up large parts of a of as chaos only necessary to store information about things that have been even you probably only need to for each of the new position and orientation not other variables like so two vectors for each which will be around a grand total of 24 bytes per that means you can store the information for objects per an awful lot of objects to have moved this data is no more complex than placing the objects in the first every object has to have a default defined for the game to put it so all doing is replacing the default with the stored value in the save this is not and require any significant additional	
	
think overthinking essentially what you want to know far as i can tell correct me if is which questions have been answered by a given and which questions for answer in unanswered questions are everything point of doing it this way rather than solution is that you should use what you know sooner rather than if you filter the for every question by your initial query will be selecting every single answer and every single question in these by starting from the known data the we are selecting only answers and questions related to that if you then want to combine the two sets into a single there are a bunch of ways you could do this for instance by creating a list of q in for q in you can iterate over retaining the order of the q in print is that this user answered the not pretty but you get the point already determined what you wanted to just a matter of contorting it to whatever data structure you happen to	
	
think reach for a tessellation true that in most case where these are used the aim is to reduce the number of vertexes to optimise but in your case you could parameterise to retain all the detail and the possibility of optimising may come in are numerous tessellation algorithms and code around on the web i wrapped up a pure c on in a dll a few years back for use with a delphi landscape and they are not an uncommon subject for advanced graphics coding tutorials and the	
	
think reflection is about the only thing that will you could optimize it using code gen or even using linq	
	
think regular expressions will make this difficult but you should be able to do it using only and to find the location in the string of 56 and cut the string up into substrings at these points using replace with the correct depending on whether 56 or 78 was sent to the function and which substring you are dealing	
	
think returning the reference from the getter is a bit do you really want clients of the class being able to modify the contents of the i would do the make a copy on and return a readonly view for the

think the answer to maintaining regular expression is not so much with commenting or regex i were tasked with debugging the example you i would sit down infront of a regex debug tool and step through the regular expression on the data that it is has to	
	
think the answer to this depends on the available technologies for the language you are going to for one am very successful with the use of an orm so naturally i may recommend option are other options that you may wish to take you are using you may opt to use attributes for your class properties to serve either as a mapping within a or as data that can be you are using fluent nhibernate will make it quite easy to make mappings within your can use generics so that you will not need to make a controller for every although i admit that it will be likely that you will do the latter however the generics can contain most of the general crud methods that is common to all and you will only need to code specific	
	
think the basic algorithm you need to do is currenty deltas heading currentx currenty are right in your idea that this be it is called for a you can get your based on the coordinate formula will be in sensor distance in inches from center of the would come from the after you convert it from pixels to to perform the you could do something 45 heading etc	
	
think the best approach is to use i would recommend a slightly more stringent than those suggested so far what if your page contains an tag that does contain an id id static return produces the following for id id has two capturing the first we the second we used lots of negative character classes up to closing to make sure that tags to have

think the best way is to use and pipe in the found that this what is happening here is that going through the valid files one by then copying them to the new the statement at the end is so that the directories are also kept when copying over the that part takes the destination directory and joins it with the directory after the source got the idea from and then modified it a bit to make it work for this hope it	
	
think the best way to achieve this is to rely on the fact that according to the ieee 754 floating point the integer representation of floating point bits are lexicographically ordered as a you could simply add one ulp in the last to get the next floating point representation will always be slightly larger than your treshold if it was since the round error is at most float floatvalue floatvalue int asint asint floatvalue floatvalue my know when you need to add one have to rely on the difference of and a rounded if int asint asint floatvalue correctly convert to but leave that the float gets promoted to a double via the multiplication with before the is you do this you risk getting in the situation that in float representation would be

think the delegate relay is what you it would let you use the published which is usually recommended rather than overriding functions not really supposed to know i agree that it does seem messier than it should have to but if the hooks in uiscrollviewdelegate are what you need for your customizations then it sounds like your best can also provide your own custom delegate to whatever uiviewcontroller is using your scroll view to do some view specific logic	
	
think the depends a lot on what the application tries to it is some utility that i might start while working in 5 different applications and it forces its on then get highly it is a specialized application that helps me with the entire workflow of a given task that i never or rarely need any other apps open at the same then fullscreen might actually be a valid you just make sure that toggling the startup behaviour is very because no matter which way some of your users will disagree with your and for them it should be very easy to change to their prefered

think the documentation of libxml2 is not pretty especially if you use the you can give some explanation what you miss in the no experience with the performance in i think the libxslt parser is pretty but probably because the have to the vm can also write your own xml tune it in the way where you need the always a bit of a how much time do i spent reading the documentation and examine how it and how much work is it to write my own xml libxml2 so it suits your needs might even be the open source solution but may cost the most	
	
think the extent of the effect depends on your hardware and video to avoid it you could just draw a rectangle and then redraw the window when the mouse button is	
	
think the idea is that you use it to generate and then it to your specific think there is no problem using the code out of the generator if it does what you want as long as you remember what it all does from a security point of view leave in actions if you want your interface to allow thing i to avoid lots of duplicate generated is the plug in it abstracts the duplicate default code and lets you override it as

think the main difference is authentication means that the identity is handled as part of the windows handashaking and now password is ever for authentication means that you have to store a username and a password yourself making it much easier to a heap of effort has gone into making windows authentication very robust and i suggest that if you do implement windows authentication use groups and roles to do groups in windows and roles in having to setup lots of users in sql is a big pain when you can just setup the group and then add each user to the think most security should be done this way	
	
think the online docs for web references sums it up fairly you leave the url behavior set the default value of the class sets the url property using url when you create instance of the you set the url behavior of the reference to the obtains the url at run time from appsettings element of configuration references in visual other you have to change it to dynamic in visual studio another if you want to set it from a config	
	
think the optimization is root of all has to be understood literally it does not say when is and does not say you should optimize only at the just not too the the right vs is a bit dangerous if taken literally because for many the n is actually think it depends a lot of the type of software you are some software are such as every part is very and can be optimized but not always the for many speed just does not matter at the brute force but obviously correct way is the best but for projects where speed it often has to be taken into account early maybe another possible interpretation of many applications need to be optimized at just know which ones need and plan

think the problem is that your plugin is not being the code you show be activated until some other tries to access something within your it seems like this is the case with your debug launch but not with the packaged could try to implement the istartup and use the extension point in your plugin to force the initialization as soon as the ui is this should activate your plugin and execute the console code that you you maybe add some logging statement or breakpoint in the method to ensure that it is being invoked on your deployed	
	
think the problem you encounter is due to the way you add the commandbutton in the jsf component to be more the way uou do not add it in the component you do not attach the commandbutton to the jsf component when this component is rendered your call to it does not find the form where this component is the html input is not created you can try to add the commandbutton created to the form before asking it to be you can do that with the following search for the component htmlform that is a parent of the current uicomponent uicomponent parent while instanceof parent return void throws ioexception htmlajaxcommandbutton replycommentbutton new add the command button in the form that contains your custom uicomponent form if that tested this so maybe you have to modify it a it still maybe you will need to review you code in order to create the commandbutton outside the render class or outside the i think it is a good idea to modify the jsf components tree during the rendering	
	
think the question of whether or not to use code generation depends on what your goals are with the example of a data access layer is a good your problem with nhibernate is that you have to generate the domain classes if your domain classes map directly to the database then this is not a one of the strengths of nhibernate in this scenario is precisely that you can define your own domain and that they do not have to map precisely to the database that means you can tweak your db layer later on and the only code you have to change is the mapping if you used code probably have to tweak a lot more and the tweaks would not always be as straightforward as the tweaks to the mapping files would have	
	
think the reason for is to determine when files are missing without the need for creating all the os housekeeping data required to access the file or having exceptions being so a file handling optimisation more than anything a single the saving the gives is generally if you were checking if a file exists many times searching for then the saving could be the specification for list any exceptions that the method might unlike for example which lists nine so certainly less checking going on in the if returns you still need to handle exceptions when opening the as the reference

think the short answer you not yet i would probably think about building a custom one like	
	
think the simplest solution is the best this depends on but just use a very globally accessible identifier in php i use a custom function and then just implement and that code as you see fit for the particular project or version of this is the standard if you want to see meaningful you need to write those labels unfortunately you could try temporarily transforming inline comments into function but not sure that would	
	
think the solution is somewhere in the if you are defining a function to find element in list you do something like no need to be explicit about what makes an input just that the reader should know that the logic assumes valid	
	
think the textbox text is always a but you can do quite sure what for multiple statements inside the body of the is but uses or newlines for so	
	
think there are any it sufficiently complex that when you show it to someone they struggle to understand it it need to cover multiple lines you have repeated condition checking in multiple clauses this would point to a required refactoring into some any of the above i would rework	
	
think there are no reasons to use iframes for much better to use a light version of fck showing just the buttons for strong and italic links and the elements that you need possible just the p and editor is highly configurable and i think is never a good idea to give to the users the ability of write too complex the typography is almost of web design and people that insert contents shoul just insert not style

think they have a long and acceptable answer for your question on the viemu other even more powerful take the which is composed of and the command deletes the range specified by the next motion and also enters insert the same as but with the distinction that it enters insert instead of staying in normal the boon is that the text you type in the next input session is also part of the so if you do what you do is replace from the cursor to the end of the word by and the command afterwards will work exactly like replace up to the end of the word with have installed year but i have to say without strong linux never used too too too imho a great challenge but no more for the of the	
	
think they should stop adding new libraries to the you can easily get what you need from with version 7 the jvm and its standard libraries will become more	
	
think this boils down to certain design create a list of requirements or a functional look at all possible ways to solve the decide which ways fits best or leads to the best you describe shows that they make a good analysis of the and in the end it comes down to how well the themselves are able to gather the right information and then make the correct this might involve asking more senior programmers examples of design methods to decide what the best possible options

think this is bit explanation but still it clarifies using real life say playing an audio involves three getting the compressed song from decompress the play the uncompressed your audio player does step sequentially for every song then it is you will have to wait for some time to hear the song till the song actually gets fetched and your audio player does step independent of each then it is playing audio 1 step if it fetches audio 3 from harddisk in parallel and it decompresses the audio 2 in 2 will end up in hearing the song without waiting much for fetch and

think this question can be answered actually writing sample code and testing the for example found the following 2738 ms 5019 ms 2540 ms arrays being the followed by 1 dimensional followed by multidimensional jagged arrays being the fastest is probably not what people would have these results are probably useless for java since java has different optimizations no multidimensional arrays in would be very careful making for if you are looping over a row of the 2d java might optimize out the index lookups or out of bounds checking wheares it might not be able to if you are using a 1d array with inline index suggest writing a simple program to test the speeds on the desired	
	
think this question has not to do with programming in but nevertheless the answers might be interesting to other web just wondered how to estimate the minimum requirements to have a fast obviously there are some facts that have to be considered like the expected number of the derived number of clicks per seconds and so also running services like web servers or mail servers could end up in different you know a good website or can give some explanations on how to estimate the needed server configuration from such servers for web development how much power is

think very if ajax had been created only to solve the problem of partial page it would not have revolutionized the web in the way it single biggest advantage offerred by ajax is communication that is initiated based on some action on the this instantly gives us the ability to make the web much more responsive and user friendly without users having to wait for page reloads and would suggest that you spend some time researching the read up on the on far as is ajax integrates very well into mature ajax frameworks such as and obfuscate much of the internal details of the

think what you need is navigation should have a navigation controller that has your rss reader as root view then whenever a user selects a story in your rss create an instance of a new view controller that has a webview as you can then pass the url to the new web view and the webview onto your navigation you have to do then is tell the webview to load the url you passed and do its when the user is all they have to do is hit the back button that gets created for you by the navigation

think you are able to do and i suspect that the limitation is part of http using the redirection happens as a header unless otherwise specified in the a look at the http spec itself reveal any way to change the type of request the browser makes via class of status code that further action needs to be by the user agent in order to the the action required be carried out by the user without interaction with the user and only if the method used in second request is get or think you may need to use javascript to achieve this or perhaps rethink the flow of control in your	
	
think you are approaching the problem from a viewpoint that is less than are focusing on the compiler lack instead of focusing on the most probable answer to your main questions is the hardware support all that embedded hardware are noted for the customization of the hardware design memory interrupt my you should first spend some time with the hardware book for the learning the ins and outs of the device how it was designed and for what primary some were designed for fast memory some for fast some for type some for signal the type of microcontroller dictates the assembler instructions they wrote for and that dictates what any compiler can do this is spend some time to look at the assembler as well it will tell you what the designers considered it will also tell you a lot about how much you can get from a microcontrollers support because the design really care about or fancy memory handling the it can be but you are often trying to pound a round peg in a square hole to get constructors and destructors and to work in the micro you have a c compiler for this consider it a a good c compiler is often than to create excellent embedded

think you are looking for so called they are a lot more powerful then just allowing but you can surly use them for google input or check out jquery like the linked plugin only supports fixed length but the term may be a good starting

think you may be trying to run before you can the concepts in there probably require a little programming experience to start thrust of the article frankly poorly is that when you are programming you often encounter tasks that benefit from a declarative you should be able to express the intent of what you want to do and leave the implementation details to a a good example is querying a much more readable to be able to declaratively describe what you want to do and let some middleware figure out the best way to do sql and linq are 2 examples of a declarative mechanism for querying is a very interesting but honestly if you have no programming experience probably more of a 201 subject than a 101 get your basics down

this is i write the code for instead try to give you some hints that will point you in the right a variable of an appropriate type to hold the value so initialize it with the value for that through all the values in the array with a or for the inside your the length of value being exceeds the length of the value so then assign value being to the value so the loop the value so will be the longest value in the can use msdn as a reference on how to use or a you learned loops you can also use a value being will be different on each iteration through the it should correspond to each consecutive value in your you can verify that this is working by a can get the length of a string by saying learned about consider writing a function that takes an array as a and returns the longest value in the are certainly ways you could do this with but i think that is the goal of the assignment response to edit statement needs to be inside of some sort of loop think this is the key concept that you are of comparing to you need to compare the length of an entry in your array to on the right track with but you just check element you have to check every element in the your current probably be assigning entry in your to last index in a array is or following really address anything in your but i hope it will give you some ideas on how to go through all the items in your a for loop that does a message box for each of the numbers from 0 to 5 i as integer 0 to code that does a message box with the names of the 3rd and last entries in members that the first item is at the second item is at response to edit getting should only update and if the current value is the longest seen so far they should be assigned inside of the have to go to the last index of the not see above response to your first on how to get that last really need the you can just use might want to use instead of to be

this type of probably use string in be the best way to do this probably depends partly on why you have to define before a string repeated a and you wanted to put it in a global variable or printf would be my or putting it in a function as other answers have the string is only used once or are you sure you refactor the code to make be defined before a bit of bland you write immediately takes the value of and puts it into the after it worried about for purposes of and even if because it contains a literal copy of the as far as a way of binding a position in a string to a the method leaves placeholders in the which the function printf replaces with values when you decide what should go in the if you wanted to only not have to call another get no way to do the closest method would be using placeholders and but that requires an explicit call to a not an implicit

those things are still i do a fair bit of that kind of optimization to be mostly writing code that has to do relatively complex things in about 10ms on an if writing code running on more modern cpus then the benefits be as you care about and doing a fair bit of then you might also look at using whatever vector operations are available on your target platform sse on altivec on compilers easily use these instructions without a lot of and the intrinsics are pretty easy to use these another thing not mentioned in the document you linked to is pointer you can sometimes get good speed improvements if your compiler has support for some kind of of thinking about cache usage can be reorganizing your code and data in a way that makes good use of the cache can result in dramatic speed increases compared to optimizing away the odd copy or unrolling a the most important thing is to only optimize code actually make sure your optimization actually makes it and look at the disassembly to see what optimizations the compiler is already doing for you before you try to improve	
	
those values i assume using a enum to allow you to find out whether the value is all if the case it is a bit odd it means you can have but never would it matter if you set an extra bit as enum dir none north south east west northwest north northeast north southwest south southeast south will keep it in numerical would be easier and more consistent if you could either make west come before or northeast come before northwest then you could just use as the extra bit for all of

though i will focus on point i begin by giving my 2 cents on the whole issue of unless differences are big or usage is usually i bother about microseconds that when added amount to any visible difference to the i emphasize that i only care when considering called where i do have special performance considerations is on the way i design the application i care about about the use of about clever ways to call methods to make several calls or to try to make only one whether to pool connections or in fact i usually focus on raw but on i care if it runs better by a tiny slice of a nanosecond for a single but i care a lot to have the ability to load the system with big amounts of simultaneous users without noticing the said here goes my opinion about point i love anonymous they give me great flexibility and code the other great feature about anonymous methods is that they allow me to directly use local variables from the container method a not from an il of they spare me loads of code when do i use anonymous evey single time the piece of code i need needed if it is used in two different i like as a reuse so use a plain just like shoosh it good to have code in theory there are no performance differences as anonyms are not il of what i think about anonymous methods applies to lambda as the latter can be used as a compact syntax to represent anonymous assume the following public static void used to represent an anonymous foreach item in if receives an array of strings and for each one of it will call the method passed to if that method returns it will say you can call this method the following names return p you can also call it the following p p is no difference in il between the being that the one using the lambda expression is much more once there is no performance impact as these are all compiler tricks jit compiler just as i feel we are overusing anonymous i feel we are overusing lambda expressions to represent anonymous of the same logic applies to repeated do use regular there are other restrictions leading you back to anonymous methods or plain like out or ref argument other nice things about lambda expressions is that the exact same syntax need to represent an anonymous lambda expressions can also you take the following public static void used to represent an binaryexpression bexpr as if is a binary node type is left side is right side is if constantexpression right value of the right side is the slightly different the second parameter receives an expression and not a the way to call this method would p p is exactly the same as the call we made when creating an anonymous method with a the difference here is that we are not creating an anonymous but creating an expression it is due to these expression trees that we can then translate lambda expressions to which is what linq 2 sql for instead of executing stuff in the engine for each clause like the the the nice thing is that the calling syntax is the same whether creating an anonymous method or sending an

thought i could work this one out myself but i seem to be moving forward at the need to create a huffman tree of codes from the information provided by the dht huffman header in a jpg the dht header defines the huffman table in this a series of 16 each byte defines how many symbols have a huffman code of n amount of bits where n is the position of the byte in the that make any for example the raw data in hex 01 05 01 01 01 means of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 16 of 00 01 05 01 01 01 01 after the list of 16 bytes come the actual symbols for 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a combining the two parts we see that their 00 codes with 1 01 codes with 2 so take the first symbol from the 05 codes with 3 so take the next 5 symbols from the 01 02 03 04 and so finally we have to work out the actual huffman codes from the information if a mathematical you may have spotted already that these codes can be worked out by simply incrementing a binary number with the appropriate number of bits for every new code at a certain bit when the bit length simply increment the binary number and then double it and carry it becomes obvious to everyone else when drawn out a number of these binary trees by so this is the code i used to work out the huffman codes and store them in an i read the data at and put it in an int binarycode count stringbuffer codestring new array with code for contains the number of codes that have a certain number of for the binary number into a 0s until the code string is the right the created huffman code in an count binarycode binarycode i have generated the huffman codes and stored them in i can just add the symbols that they refer to in order as they come along in this may not be terribly elegant but it seems to work at least and creates the correct if anyone is still following you deserve a now the problem is like to store this information in a binary tree so that i can efficiently decode the jpg image data later rather than searching through arrays unfortunately i figure out a nice clean and efficient way to do this directly from the information provided in the jpg headers as only way i can think of is by working out the huffman codes as above then implementing some method that creates nodes as needed and saves the symbols in the appropriate using the codes as an address of however this seems such a round about way that is also duplicating the information i sure there must be a much better and simpler so if anyone understood my be very grateful for some i realise this is a very specific but if nothing else the info above might prove helpful to i am still very new at this so excuse my easy to understand code is especially to create huffman tree from ffc4 header in jpeg	
	
thought i really understood and the standard just confirms my obviously wrong so now i ask following program struct int struct int char this line return the expressions and according to my interpretation of the array definition of the operator is that identical to this has type to and the value is the start address of therefore evaluates to an integer object whose storage is at the same address that and function when it is the operand of sizeof operator or the unary an lvalue that type of is converted an expression with type that points to the element of the array object and is an has type of and is as described above converted to to with the address of the first element as therefore evaluates to an integer object whose storage is at the same address that the first element in the structure and union pointer to a structure suitably points to initial member and vice there may be unnamed padding within structure but not at as necessary to achieve appropriate the first member of is the the start address and the whole object is the same as described understanding were therefore that evaluates integer whose storage is at the same address that the in the array and thus is identical to this cannot be the because the program crashes cygwin and linux with gcc versions so any environmental issue is completely out of the is my reasoning do i not do i declare to make ptr point to the first member of the vs array in

thread will get and no way to tell seem like a reasonable is there a reason why you need two threads calling on the same	
	
threads might be running on different with different memory they might be running on the same with one interrupting the this has two you have no way of knowing whether one thread will be interrupted by another in the middle of doing so in your no way to be sure that thread1 try to read the string value before thread2 has written or even that when thread1 reads it is in a if it is not in a consistent then using it might do when you write to memory in one there is no telling if or when code running in another thread will see that the change might sit in the cache of the writer thread and not get flushed to main it might get flushed to main memory but not make it into the cache of the reader part of the change might make it and part of it without locks other synchronization mechanisms such as you have no way of saying whether something that happens in thread a will occur or something that happens in thread you also have no way of saying whether or when changes made in thread a will be in thread use of locking ensures that all changes are flushed through the so that code sees memory in the state you think it should it also allows you to control whether particular bits of code can run simultaneously interrupt each this looking at your code the minimum locking you need is to have a synchronisation primitive which is by the second thread after it has written the and on by the first thread before using that this would then guarantee that the first thread sees any changes made by the second assuming the second thread started until after firstfunctionrunfromthread1 has been if that might not be the then you need the same deal with thread1 writing and thread2 simplest way to actually do this is to have a mutex which your you decide what data and any code which reads or writes the data must be holding the mutex while it does so first you then read write the then this ensures consistent but on its own it does not ensure that thread2 will get a chance to do anything at all in between two different kind of mechanism will also include the necessary memory so if you send a message from the writer thread to the reader meaning finished you can read then that will be can be more efficient ways of doing certain if those prove too

to a single you only grant connect to a the user can connect but has no other you have to grant usage on namespaces and select on tables and views individually like connect on database mydb to this assumes actually connected to usage on schema public to select on mytable to the latest versions of you can grant permissions on all in the schema using a single command rather than having to either type them one by select on all tables in schema public to only affects tables that have already been more you can automatically have roles assigned to new in default privileges in schema grant select on tables to that by default this will only affect objects created by the user that issued this although it can also be set on any role that the issuing user is a member you pick up default privileges for all roles a member of when creating new so still some faffing if you adopt the approach that a database has an owning and schema changes are performed as that owning then you should assign default privileges to that owning imho this is all a bit confusing and you may need to experiment to come up with a functional versions before avoid errors in it is recommended to use the following process to generate the required to each select on relname to join on nspname and relkind in should output the relevant grant commands to grant select on all and sequences in for this will only be applied to tables that have already been

to xml is indeed the way textarray text based on the it looks like you just need a way of representing if somewhat indexentry in select new etiologycode null null code to set other properties in this note alternative is to extract it into a separate extension method has to be in a static static string this values you could parameterise the delimiter here if you return change your code indexentry in select new etiologycode null null code to set other properties in this note a note about answers have suggested using in the name of i would check for evidence of this being the right way to go before using if you think about and do similar things they create a buffer bigger than they need add data to resize it when and come out with a result at the the hope is that you need to resize too between and here is being buffered in the entire contents of the string built up so with in other resizing the internal buffer used for is likely to be cheaper than resizing the one for if the individual strings are doing the buffering in is hugely it can look through the strings to start work out how much space to and then concatenate it without ever having to copy the actual character is in contrast to a previous answer but unfortunately i think i ever wrote up the certainly expect to be significantly and i think it makes the code simpler here no need to use aggregation

too am a big fan of spring when used in conjunction with spring which is just now webflow can be used with other web frameworks but most natural fit is with spring my case i went from struts to spring we had a lot of built up infrastructure for using one thing i underestimated when writing new pages in spring mvc is how much time we would spend essentially reinventing that talking common logic and so i know a whole lot about it sounds like having that problem you would with any web the fact that that process is still going on may be a real you ignore the fact that have it with something else find spring mvc and webflow are best once you have some infrastructure around validations and forms for we had this process a lot on our places validates parameters and either rejects order to or accepts verified order is returned to displayed to the user who confirms that they either want to place the order or cancel they cancel display a page saying it has been they approve verify the order it fails validation return to place the order and display the result to the may sound convoluted but it came up a where spring mvc really shines is for this kind of scenario you can create a custom controller and then the actual implementation just becomes an issue of plugging in the right views and support underestimate the cost of developing and testing required other thing to consider is team if noone else has spring mvc experience then going to present some be very careful taht you change just because make you personally more

tried to do the exact same thing and spent far too much time in the i settled on using the gzip compressor provided by tinymce and concentrated on combining the css files and images for what i the problem is that tinymce is it dynamically loads the files it and it make use of an existing javascript so it ends up replicating a lot of the same code if you are already using any sort of was the only other editor i felt had the same features and browser but it look like it was going to be any easier in terms of integrating into my caching scheme sounds similar to and i think the licensing made it a for you can look at a of editors available but those were the two i felt were the best from that in the i decided to go with tinymce and added making a wysiwyg editor for mootools onto my list since the javascript framework i most often you were to hack at i would suggest figuring out every script that your specific implementation of tinymce combine them in and then isolate and comment out the code that loads each if you could then try the combined file as if you do get it to love to

trow in another approach you could consider on how desperate you that operating system implementations need to be general but you are only interested in a very specific so it might make sense to implement a version of only handles your but does that very in your application if you are using you could route a couple of ip addresses to a tun interface and have your application handle the ip packets for that tun that way you can implement for your entirely in your application and avoid any operating system restriction on the number of open quite a bit of work doing the but it really depends on how desperate you are how much hardware can you afford to throw at the

try not to comment the obvious however the modern techniques of documenting the code often force to break this consider the following returns the user string the function return end we need this longer that the function itself to know what it is supposed to no the code itself is clear enough and but unless we add the there will be problems with the documentation generators and i think that the answer to the question do we depend on the code we are going to when making a website i unsually put any for the standard parts of the because almost all of them follow the same check the parse the optionally get the do the something with the redirect the user such code is easily readable even after two or more the other we have a specialized code that solves a particular technical for example a kind of the complexity is we use some data the algorithm may move the data between them to perform a certain task if i see that the algorithm does not follow any popular i describe the used data its purpose and what operations are performed on them in order to complete the i also try to why the specified solution was i find the comment syntax useful internal and system functions that are not exposed but also should be briefly especially in complex code just to what they are actually why and what their arguments the alternative is to find all the occurences of them and i must also point that sometimes it is very hard to what is worth a couple of months ago i returned to a piece of code in one of my projects to add some extra suddenly i noticed a quite important condition and had no why i used i think it must have been something obvious while writing this but even the investigation help last comment practice i use is marking the end of the class and interface with its end helps me

try to force a corporate environment style agile programming workflow onto your but i do think that some level of agile methodology could be i actually think that some of your would be mitigated somewhat by some of the agile but would require some level of commitment from every one on the example the daily meetings have to be a large thing especially in a student project say making it smaller is having a trac site recommend over sharepoint if using svn with a single place a wiki to just track the standup info in one sentence can still be without taking more than minutes per day somebody misses a day or two here and not a big but if the team agrees to doing it can actually help the procrastination issue people to just say did doing has a benefit it keeps people at least thinking about your which tends to reduce the amount of as well as having people work in different locations but still stay in is also easy enough for to and can help keep the mechanical and electrical teams working and everybody moving being make sure to keep it short and sweet try to keep the burden to a but i still think value in some of the agile programming even in a student

try to use multiple threads for creating or for working with the vcl in this is not going to improve speed but more importantly is a complete with the you should read the other questions and answers here on stackoverflow that deal with the vcl and multiple but in the vcl is not all access to controls has to be done in the context of the main so when using multiple threads you would have to wrap nearly everything in which would actually serialize all threads and slow things down best bet is to restructure your ui so that it does not need to be created all at create all frames only when they are to be shown for the first here is some test code to show that setting the parent property the real but creating all the controls all message handling that probably visible for i 1 to 20 do y 20 i for j 1 to 10 do x edit ticks visible caption code dynamically creates 200 after freeing the handle of the parent creating all those controls and setting their properties takes a few 10 milliseconds on my but finally showing the form will create all takes a few 100 since this can only be done in the main thread i doubt that using multiple threads will help

trying to use an unmanaged c dll for loading image data into a the library has a fairly simple interface where you pass in a struct that contains three one to receive the size of the one that receives each row of the pixels and finally one called when the load is like this managed struct public public public types starting are delegate int int the test file that using the setsize should get called then the sendline will get called 200 times for each row of pixels in the finally the done callback gets what actually happens is that the sendline is called 19 times and then a accessviolationexception is thrown claiming that the library tried to access protected have access to the code of the c library i change the and during the loop where it calls the sendline method it does not allocate or free any new so my assumption is that the delegate itself is the issue and i need to pin it before i pass it in have no code inside the delegate itself besides a counter to see how often it gets so i doubt breaking anything on the managed the problem is that i know how to do the method been using to declare the structs in unmanaged space work with delegates and i find any other suitable the delegates themselves are static fields in the program class so they be being garbage but i guess the runtime could be moving blog entry by chris says that delegates need to be pinned before being passed into unmanaged the unmanaged function pointer must refer to a fixed it would be a disaster if the gc were relocating this leads many applications to create a pinning handle for the this is completely the unmanaged function pointer actually refers to a native code stub that we dynamically generate to perform the transition this stub exists in fixed memory outside of the gc i know if this holds true when the delegate is part of a it does imply that it is possible to manually pin them and interested in how to do this or any better suggestions as to why a loop would run 19 times then suddenly to answer code that allocates the struct is as new new some other sendline protocolsize the and the variables are both static fields of the program if i understand the internals of this that means that passing an unmanaged pointer to a of the variable into the c but that copy contains a reference to the static this should mean that the copy touched by the gc since it is unmanaged and the delegate be collected since it is still in scope struct actually gets passed to the library as a return value from another but as a static intptr return there is another struct type that holds the image filename and the function pointer to this the library figures out what type of image is stored in the file and uses this callback to request the correct protocol struct for the given my filename struct is declared and managed in the same way as the protocol one so probably contains the same but since this delegate is only called once and called quickly i had any problems with it to to everybody for their but after spending another couple of days on the problem and making no progress i decided to shelve in case anyone is interested i was attempting write a tool for users of the lightwave 3d rendering application and a nice feature would have been the ability to view all the different image formats that lightwave supports of which are fairly i thought that the best way to do this would be to write a wrapper for the plugin architecture that lightwave uses for image manipulation so i could use their code to actually load the unfortunately after trying a number of the plugins against my solution i had a variety of errors that i understand or fix and my guess is that lightwave call the methods on the plugins in a standard probably to improve the security of running external code stab in the i for the time being going to drop the image feature and if i do decide to reinstate it approach it in a different i learnt a lot through this process even though i get the result i a delegate within a struct before passing to unmanaged

understand why git does not offer some kind of what you are referring to as an involving a you must first understand one of the of those scms clearcase for uses a version each version of an element or is linked in a direct relationship with the the previous version of the same uses a acyclic each of a file is actually part of a global set of changes in a tree that is itself part of a the previous version of that must be found in a previous accessible through a single directed acyclic graph a linear a config spec can specify several rules for achieving the you see a given first select a certain and if not then select another and if not then select a and so branch is a in a history a given version for a given select rule the other select rules before that one still hence the a a commit represents all the you will ever there is no selection of there is only one path in this graph to select all the files you will see at this exact point branch is just a new path in this in some other you must into your branch some other commit in the git mentioned by or your branch since git is a it will always result in a new you are with git is some kind of you are selecting different versions with different successive select but that would not be practical in a in when you are making a branch with you need to do so with a starting point a clearly defined and easily replicated to other a purely central you can define your workspace your either snapshot or with whatever rules you adds in the comment in his question once we see the two models can achieve different things vs my question which are the real life scenarios for companies more than where linear can do things not possible for are they worth it comes to in term of selection what you can do in a linear model is to have selection rules the same set of this for selection rules with alabel3 alabel2 selects all the files labelled branch from except for those labelled and branch from there that rule precedes the one mentioning it worth the ucm flavor of clearcase configuration methodology included with the clearcase and representing all the deduced from base clearcase does not allow for reasons of a set of files is called a and if you want to branch for a given label as a that would be translated like this following config alabel3 have to pick starting point and go from you want also the files from you will make a merge from all the files to the ones in is a you do not have to make with a where each node of the graph represents a uniquely defined for a whatever is the set of files and rebase are enough to combine that starting point with other versions of a given set of in order to achieve the desired while keeping that particular history in a general goal is to reason in version control operations applied to a set of files is one in a coherent its files are its files will branch from the starting is easily done in a dag it can be more difficult in a linear system with where the can be but it is enforced with the ucm methodology of that same of achieving that through a selection rule some select rule you achieve it only with vcs operations or which leave a clear trace for everyone to follow opposed to a config spec private to a or shared amongst some but not all it enforces a senses of opposed to a that you may have a hard time to reproduce later allows you to leave the realm of control and enter the realm of configuration which is mainly concerned with and that can be achieved with a or a

usual pattern for a page you must have personally i hate is your download will begin if it the same with a instead of the either way should behave pretty much the meta refresh approach also but still the address bar changes to the url of the file and the underlying window is blank after the file is there a version online that can be when the browser is pushed to a direct file download by any normal method it should keep the previous page environment allow me to set so p3p is have to use headers to set p3p an html tag works just as why would you need if the target url is just serving a there is no need to set a cookie at so why bother with desperately trying to avoid to dodge any popup blocker you in response to a user there are no blocker that you should need to open a just to download a file i am beginning to think there is something highly strange about the file download destination you are linking not a file download at all but some kind of odd html web linking to a download is not you just link to the job you seem to be making this much harder than it intrinsically only usual problem with just linking to a file is that if it contains xml or an the browser will display it inline instead of downloading the only way to defeat this is using the either by serving it through a script that sets this or by configuring your web server to send that header for all file if you do either of those in your server there is no

usually the wrong thing to make a handling of formatting issues like the decimal separator dependent on the locale of the web this adds a server configuration issue which can make it harder to deploy your whilst not actually necessarily giving the end user what they for example you might want to install a french and an english deployment of the same app to a single also quite common for the system locale to be set to something inappropriate due to legacy issues apps that only work in or production servers all over the world running as the version of normally better to handle this in the application having either one locale option per deployment of your site or one locale option per user of the then anyone can log in to the app and get the appropriate number if your interface is exclusively it may be more appropriate to stick with the english number formatting germans will have got used to it could actually be confusing to have a mixture of english and german ui conventions localise or not at

variables are essentially pointers to a place in a memory containing an object not the object in the second you are initializing a constant to point to an object in the first line and in the second you are again initializing the constant but it already points to an so you get the immutability mean you alter the object it just means you change the constant to point to	
	
variables are not allocated on the stack like your and variables are in this allocated in memory at a immutable memory even if the containing function is never cause problems when the function is used in multiple threads although your example has a very small likelihood of a race assigned once offhand i recall if on the first time the function is called or on when the code is loaded i help you to think of it as if the compiler moves the declaration outside the scope but access is restricted to within the

was wondering about the basis of the question because i thought it was easy to however as soon as you go it becomes clear that its actually a good question because pretty much the first thing on the page is this specification defines the features and syntax for the extensible stylesheet language a language for expressing it consists of two language for transforming xml vocabulary for back in the real xslt is also what most people will assume you mean by is a means for transforming xml documents into something else that something else more often than not being another well structured document probably also formatted as xml used xslt to render xml to csv and on the other hand is about formatting about laying out content on a page or a sequence of pages in a fairly strict its useful because it allows you to manage content that is spread across multiple its relatively straightforward to specify the format of a page even and odd including etc and have your content flow into one would therefore take a load of data an xml format and then use xslt to convert that data into a document consisting of that in turn is rendered using an appropriate tool in say pdf for print or other means of use case i have is to take a pile of tabular export that data as render that into and from there to pdf which goes to a printer who turns said pdf into a 500 page one specifies in the that one wants page page breaks in specific that there is a table of contents and an index based on particular and the rendering process handles filling in the page numbers across the a bit less confused

ways i can think of in probable order of a linux program that listens on a network socket for your windows app sends the appropriate the linux program runs the command to set the environment variable something like this be secure over the network unless you make it ssh to login to the linux then run a script to set the i know if there are ssh libraries around for windows but be surprised if there putty is an excellent windows ssh client so you may be able to use code from there but you should check the license first depending on how you plan to use your this option has the benefit that you can use pki to secure the network if

we have a collection of events in this where each pojo is possibly different we need to process this using different rules for each pojo class if the classes of pojos are stable often just described the motivation for using the visitor because you want to do different things to your collection of you can create an abstractbasevisitor and extend it to handle the different things you need to will require putting a tiny wrapper around each with one wrapper class per pojo to add a function that calls back to the	
	
we have a structure like this to describe a 4x4 type type type type type type type type type type all you have is euler that is an angles representing the and roll and a point in 3d space for the you can calculate the and look note that and look are just the but since this is a i find it easier to name it the simplest way to apply your roations to the camera matrix is to build a series of rotation matrices and multiply our camera matrix by each rotation good reference for that is you have applied all the needed you can set the vector pos to the position in the world before you apply the you need to take the inverse of its this is what you are going to multiply your modelview matrix by before you start drawing for the matrix class the inverse is calculated like orthinv return with all our matrix constuction out of the you would be doing something like cameramatrix rollrotation pitchrotation this	
	
we need more but guessing having problems with the as a connection string in your dbml designer and it match your production db connection this is the then perhaps write a class that handles all instantiations of your datacontext in your within that whenever a new datacontext is you override the dbml connectionstring with your current probably from your this ensures your linq stuff is always connected to the correct db during something like this property names might shared function as dim dcontext as dcontext new return

web page uses google charts to produce five if the graphs are not already i have the following line of code that retrieves the that code is executed in a it takes 10 seconds to get each if i change the code as to use one of ip addresses instead of the takes less than one second to retrieve the so my initial thought was that dns is not resolving the url and the delay is from cycling through the assigned dns so i tried to ping from the server and it immediately returned a reasonable my question is there any php configuration setting that i may be overlooking that may cause this or does this sound like a server configuration slow	
	
web service is loaded into process that is run under aspnet you can attach to this process and debug given you have the sources and the code is compiled with debug information file should be able to use the unc file shares given they have proper access since the web service is run under a local user you may have hard time settings access restrictions on the file server because it has no idea of how to validate the in this case you can create a application for hosting your com components and run it under a separate

webformview type eventually calls there is not an overload or other function in buildmanager to take input from a stream instead of from a virtual if you do not want to implement iview you will need to actually unpack the files to disk so that they can be compiled by you could still distribute your dll as a single but the aspx files need to be produced in order for buildmanager to compile see for	
	
well tried to solve that problem i wasted two month on a solution that tried to solve the zero overdraw as already found out you deal with all degenerated cases and have zero overdraw at the same can however use a hybrid yourself a routine that checks if the joins can be constructed from simple geometry without to do so you have to check the the width of the line and the length of the joined that are shorter than their width are a with some heuristics you should be able to sort out all the trivial know how your average looks but in my case more than of the wide lines had no degenerated all other most probably already found out that if you tolerate generating the geometry is a lot do and let a polygon csg algorithm and a tesselation algorithm do the hard evaluated most of the available tesselation and i ended up with the glu it was never crashed most other it was free and the license allowed me to include it in a commercial the quality and speed of the tesselation is you will not get delaunay triangulation but since you just need the triangles for rendering not a i disliked the tesselator api i lifted the tesselation code from the free sgi opengl reference rewrote the entire and added memory pools to get the number of allocations it took two days to do but it was well worth it factor five performance the solution ended up in a commercial openvg implementation btw rendering with opengl on a you may want to move the from the cpu to the gpu and use or tricks to remove the a lot easier and may be even faster than cpu

what are some best practices for building a community love this is what i think of when i think of an online have an idea for a website that educators could school curriculum college want to build a community site simular to the ux will not be the because the users are not as web savy as we i want to think too much about ui at this right it is just an are some best practices for building a community have also looked at for far i like the votes on user other things are kind of a sub is there a way to determine if someone is an i charged a registration fee very very i could maybe have a human call and verify they are who they that seems wrong to me to charge the are many companies that would love to spam these do i keep the spamers and verify that those registering really are i even just let the community police have many question and i am just looking for some in are the best practices for building a community

what i have found on is the library you need to locate and add its path to your build see if that	
	
what i have used in the past for a disposable pattern suggest starting with class connection dispose performs tasks associated with or resetting unmanaged public void private void if derived classes from this class should override this to clean up managed resources when dispose is protected virtual void enter managed resource cleanup code derived classes should override this method to clean unmanaged resources when dispose is protected virtual void enter unmanaged resource cleanup code

what other problems are you having with sounds like you want the users to handle the we the problem with that is they never want to use whatever data model is someone has to know how to query the you already have that by using stored maybe let a couple users learn basic crystal principals and you write the stored procedure and they format it with that way you bypass the biggest stumbling block with which is doing the table joins in have crystal knowledge and think fairly easy to i call it skillz more like i know what it can and so i can save myself a lot of not trying to defend but if it	
	
what point are you trying to access the if you try within init of a the iboutlets will be the first method you can get at them is probably reason it does make sense to do things this way is that iboutlets are just direct pointers to some even if they are already subviews of something just saves a lot of helmstetter	
	
what this error means that not referencing the table name one common reason is that the table is defined with a and trying to query it with all other the following table from to delimit identifiers so you can use the specific spelling as the table is from your you can add a schema to the so that when you reference a table name without qualifying its the query will match that table name by checked each schema in just like in the shell or in you can check your current schema search can change your schema search to also

what trying to i have a simple framework and i am using mod rewrite to rewrite the urls so that they point to the correct i have a process folder which sits inside the web folder web folder is where all the actual website files like etc works great but what i am trying to do now is to have a file to process the the file works great if i point the form to it but i want to be able to point the form to proper file and if the file is not there then it uses the forms are create by a class and the action is set to go to of the the idea is that anyone can create a form using the class and if they need to do anything the file will process the realize i can just set the form class to always use the and then on the file i can check if the proper file if it then use that if it then keep processing the form but i am still curious to know if something like this would work on mod redirect if file

what you want is named parameters it looks to me is what you are trying to would you ever consider just passing in an associative with the names as there is also the named parameter can only find a good reference for this for perhaps called something else by php change your methods on costcountingdata so they all returned the original that way you could rewrite your top piece of code to new two i would probably go for the named parameter idiom myself as it is but i think the difference is too

when confronted with think regular now they two jamie zawinski the regular expressions as simple as they can possibly be in your date likely use one regular expression for each even replaced it with a library a also take steps to ensure that the input source had some restrictions only one type of ideally thing at the time the possible exception of extracting constructs are ok if used correctly in simplying the expression and hence reducing constructs lead maintainance original point was that if used it should lead to not more difficult simpler expressions should updated the text above to say as would point out that regular expressions hardly qualify as advanced constructs in and of not being familiar with a certain construct does not make it an advanced merely an unfamiliar which does not change the fact that regular expressions are compact if used much like a it lies entirely in the hands of the one who wields

will soon work on a project about a mobile application will work on a pdt with windows mobile and we will use visual studio and to developp application will intensively use wifi and need to consume as little power as found on the internet a lot of stuff concerning embedded software and real time which deal with power but this stuff is very hardware and does not talk about software also found some interesting best practices but that mainly focus on the code of the application close handles as soon as possible or use few would like to know if you are aware of some leads concerning the architecture or the design of such also saw advice about the use of event driven is it so useful concerning power saving and is it usable with the compact framework for your so dave gave us some that we could call architecture i think i see clearly what could be done at two differents a such decisions as a low level of close to the tricks and tips that minimize the battery about at a middle level of abstraction the design is there some methodology for software design what so to design a less power consuming mobile	
	
will support threads in the of each platform has its own way of implementing threads but you can use something such as to not have to worry about there is a to put a class into another you will create a thread while passing that class into the then the thread will call a function in that here is some object thread wait for is all simplified by the use of boost in and the thread class in java handles this for large problem in threaded applications is synchronization of this includes problems like and to name a exist to help these such as a a mutex can be locked by one and any other threads that try to lock the mutex will be blocked until the original thread releases the is a generalized are other useful concepts as outlined in

windows app has at its core a loop that looks something like 0 0 if handle the error and possibly the the operating ensure that messages are you probably early windows games used an alternate method instead of calling the blocking call and then call the main processing loop if there was no message to various forms of delays were used to try to get an adequate frame rate without taking there just a good enough timer to give a smooth frame it might not be necessary to explicitly write a loop that calls it possible now to get a smooth frame rate by using the timer pool timers in by and wrapped by i there were also issues with getting mouse and keyboard events in a timely we used direct keyboard and mouse access rather than depending on the message because the message loop was often too slow and sometimes would cause us to lose not written games in a number of and i know what is like as a games possible that input is still a the message queue simply fast enough to give the response that game developers so they bypass the message queue for critical

with all good simplified what actually trying to this is but it is worth noting that python has a of flexibility when it comes to class versus instance the same can be said of for a good list of i recommend starting especially sections 2 through thing that takes a lot of work to remember when getting started is that is not more than just a in an entire class is making the namespace resolution real any variables declared outside a method are instance if variables and are implicitly accessible within the grand rule of thumb is that there are three namespaces that are in for current are limited exceptions to the main one that occurs to me is when a class definition is being the class definition is its own implicit but this lasts only as long as the module is being and is entirely bypassed when within a class foo bar class foo def return bar recent call file line in class file line in bar file line in return global name is not the the thing to remember is that you have access to any of the variables you want to but probably not if your goals are simple and then going for or will probably be if your example is getting more or you want to do fancy things like inheritance can inherit or the idea of referring to the name of your class within the class itself seems wrong to check out the intro i

with most if the joins are relatively inconsequential a small number of joins on and you are storing especially complex it may be better just to stick with the more complex also a matter of in many cases the purpose of many joins is to bring together very disparate that data which varies widely in its relative it can add complexity and overhead to keep a pair table synchronized when a small slice of the data across a large number of pairs is system complexity can often be considered a form of performance the risk and cost to make a change to a complex system without impacting performance is often far greater than a simple best solution is always to what works as simply as you in most cases say this means create a fully normalized database design and join the crap out of only revisit your design performance becomes an obvious when you analyze the it will also be obvious where the problems lie and what needs to be done to fix if reducing then so be know when you need to

wonder how people are kicking people out or blocking access to a site when you want to do an upgrade and you have users that are logged one thought is to just put a bool setting in a global file as the settings for whether or not the site is true is while false is when the next time the user attempts to access the site they will either be logged out or just presented with an unavailable are 2 issues i can see with this users are just finishing filling in a long form or writing a large portion of text a new question or answer on as soon as they submit the lose that always save because there maybe db changes for that table or code may have changed on a busy editing the global file if more than a couple lines it might cause php parse errors if that page is loaded while partially uploaded or while there might also be locking issues on the depending on the option is to have a field in the database with the same at the i generally have a table for so this would be the only thing in the but i could see it being faster as it avoids the second there something that used that worked well or any other working with is the best method for taking a site down and kicking out users to do an

working on a project that has to connect to some ancient webservices that pack some hierarchical data for requests and responses into single strings of hierarchical been using to generate xsds from sample request and response xml modifying them where necessary to be the best possible and using again to generate the managers that call the webservices can then take those request objects as serialize them to strings in order to make the get the responses back as deserialize them into the response objects and return i a list of i can have a valid xsd that considers it a complex type of an unbounded of and then it will deserialize simply to a string which is nice and simple to deal the annoying problem is that for some there seem to be any way to get it to call the string array anything other than no matter i add to the i get to write any other an example xsd the resulting partial class accountstatusrequest private public items get return set tried adding pretty much every attribute in intellisense to both the choice and the inner and nothing makes a for the sake of i added a couple extra similar choices to that to see if that would force it to use a name for the string but instead it gave me really want it to have to be an array of its own type that only holds a but i also really want to leave it called without xml comments anyone know how to add those to an when it should have a more descriptive and i definitely just change it manually as the desired workflow whenever the webservice schemas change is to change the xsds and then the classes from seems like another one of those things should is there something should i take a different approach or is there an alternative tool i can use for this instead less can i get arrays to have a name other than when generating code from an xsd

works fine for class autogreyableimage public static readonly dependencyproperty customproperty public string get return as set and	
	
works fine on my version of firefox perhaps you have the latest i run an image gallery but i think type of layout would work very well for me as i have descriptions for my images and some of the images are quite i it might be worth experimenting	
	
works for although i got really confused about all those generic which means i guarantee that it does what supposed to extends a extends extends extends a extends s class extends a extends implements private final atoms new public public return public return class extends a extends implements private final s public public s return public return space1 extends public atom1 extends public	
	
works in perhaps in windows import print	
	
works really well for projects based on mvc using it on a couple of projects at the moment and finding it a very good fit with an implementation of the record that uses nhibernate under the hood in other as long as happy having one class per database do most of the nhibernate configuration for leaving you free to write code bob customer id goes here newinvoice new product id goes here very little explicit nhibernate configuration you have invoice and product tables in your of nhibernate under the migrating to nhibernate if you need to should be straightforward already have all the necessary references and there are a few aspects of nhibernate behaviour that you ignore scopes and but not too hard to work out going on with and using them in activerecord will give you a head start you need to move to using nhibernate	
	
works well for both headings and body	
	
works well most of the occasionally get graphical glitches my 4 out of 5 images showed up but the fifth had a slight distortion on the right i fixed it my increasing the image right margin by that still fix try the bitmap class control above that eugenez a replacement for the image control and so far worked pretty well for see	
	
works without any complaints from the foo private const uint private readonly new	
	
workstation is scanning ports in the however virus scan have not picked anything up the only option to clean the hard there any new malware of this description that have not yet been for scanning by the software scanning orginating from a virus scan do not show any	
	
worried about bits on the you could always run a minifier on your then you could develop with long and you could release with a much smaller file equivalent the yahoo looks like it does whitespace compression and token	
	
worry so much about the problem in is that postback events and viewstate mean the server may not render the same url in the same way it takes the current of the app into so when the user hits the back because viewstate and other postback data is not available going in this direction they may not see the page in the same way they were keep the back button working you need to turn off viewstate and handle all server events with a to a new	
	
worst comes to you could omit the encoding set httpheader to the response for and if gunzip the response	
	
worth looking at	
	
worth noting that many encodings use any byte order an empty string in is just an empty while there is a bom specified for it is rarely used in java and is not always	
	
worth taking a look at the nhibernate query analyzer by oren used to analyze hql queries it also has a fairly useful hbm query analyzer project page flash project will allow editing for hbm files and will show all of the available attributes for each mapping that you download the source code it be that trivial to add the inline	
	
would actually present pairs of these attributes to users and ask them to define their you would present them with a scale reaching from or having many people do this you will end up with a widely accepted proximity function for the attribute	
	
would add that it is unlikely for you to find lower level functions like these in the if you were confused as to why the suggestions both pointed to then you probably could use some details on there are ways to define functions that them to windows api functions that do not exist within assemblies they are typically implemented in and available as a standard this process is considered to be platform can be a bit wobbly at first to match up all the data types between and style but there are others out there that have paved the suggested has a over at this wrapper when available in your will allow you to call sendinput as if it were a is basically a pinvoke wiki for well known api calls in and typically has a wrapper of api	
	
would add that you also need to instantiate an instance of the class for your project addtion to adding a reference to the namespace as noted by easiest way to do this is to drag an inputpanel control onto your windows form in design whatever you name your inputpanel instance would be what you reference in the event handlers for your form	
	
would agree with your initial idea on this one however it does depend on the create the base rule and add to the stylesheet with exceptions to that example if you are sure that a table within a table will definately never need the same style applied to it then use the selector to set the if however that may only occur once then set a class on the parent table and amend your selector to be something along the lines of should be changed to a descriptive name for the like calendar as that is what it you should not name a class after a particular style because if the style changes it makes no sense any	
	
would also just say i think correct in doing	
	
would also look into either realbasic or they both create cross platform native personally i think realbasic would be a better choice as it is very language to you can learn some valuable skills with rb and it can grow with your i have been using vb and rb for more then 10 years combined and i think you will be	
	
would always log the exception within my application the server side as defined in your would then throw an to be caught by the if the caller could take corrective action to prevent the exception then i would ensure that the exception contained this information argname must not be in the if the error was caused by some outage of a third party system then i might pass this information up the call stack to the the exception was essentially caused by a bug in my system then i would structure my exception handling such that a exception message was	
	
would always take a look at john m about maybe browse through out	
	
would argue that the ease and simplicity of writing python code makes it possible to write more complex for code that takes advantage of since performance has been mostly stagnant for the past i think clear that python programs running on cpython or something are slower in the long	
	
would assume the equality operator actually compared the two strings hash rather than the actual content least as a the prefix matching would require a substring creation before hash value comparison then it follows that prefix matching should be much slower than full equality you have enough strings you need to prefix you should look into implementing a trie structure	
	
would avoid forcing the view to implement an interface only for change create a separate event on the model	
	
would be an approximative timespan span see also this question on stack do i calculate age in	
	
would be certain that this question addresses something that would have been brought up in a previous but i was unable to find is a method in a class that takes as a parameter a generic list of a base i need to pass a list of an inherited class and do not know exactly how to do i am getting an error in my below is sample code to illustrated class public static void do something here with the class b b inherits from a is the base class code utilizing the above method listofb new listofb this does not this does not this does not how can i accomplish it should be possible i would here is my final working method as a i got an even better solution to my but technically it an answer to the since my question was phrased public static datatable where glist datatable ret if foreach var b in datatable dt if ret if return a list of base type to a list of inherited	
	
would be hard to get it more inefficient as this but here as as as as as as case when 12 then else	
	
would be helpful to know about the security error you a result of the origin for web	
	
would be important if i have voting on each because then the tree would need to be reordered after each vote a potentially expensive operation like a premature optimization to possibly even a faulty tree data structure sounds logical for representing your i say stick with optimize it later only if a performance problem is detected and and can be compared with	
	
would be my best option for a graphic majoring in cs but also want to be fairly competent in ui	
	
would be the best to find a programmer that has already designed some known framework for the language in your users think is irelevent i becuase you judge about framework by asking arbitrary programmer his toughts about his answer will depend upon his level of knowledge and personal methodologies while api is being designed for wider population am assuming this is your to finish this in my firm programmers that use think that is lame language becuase of like you write button in and let the compiler automatically find default property for you want such person judging your designers experienced in different languages may be of help because wider used apis should be implemented with the help of well known programming patterns people are already familar	
	
would be the best way to implement the have a collection of objects that implement an internally i want to be able to expose set and get on the properties and externally only an example of the sort of thing i interface string name interface iinternaltable string name class table public string name public string get return class private public get return and external interfaces and	
	
would be very interesting to see the execution plan for the using plan for select from querying a view then this might show how the predicate is being evaluated in the wrong	
	
would build the ancillary tasks into the first feature that requires is important to distinguish the difference between the product backlog and the sprint the product backlog contains user stories that represent not when a story is selected for a the story is then broken down into the tasks required to build would be a task for the items to no harm at the sprint planning level for tasks to have dependencies in most of the time there will be tasks that make life easier for other product backlog that	
	
would certainly be an odd thing to but yeah you could call suggest throwing an exception instead that gets you a chance to and your caller can decide how to handle the if nobody still bring down the process but somewhat more	
	
would consider to learn them both at the same spring and nhibernate are both large frameworks with a high learning it will take you some studying and experimenting time to become familiar with and good at when you are busy with both the you will automatically focus on the most useful parts of them learning the important parts first will make the learning curve	
	
would consider using a javascript tool that you can use to embed flash objects to you is simple to use and has many very just use for if you need anything special you have to study a lots of demos on the site how to configure the flashembed is designed for for scripters in mind with polished programming api together with a support for jquery when supplying configuration for flash objects the values can be complex javascript objects with functions and other the plugin weights around 5 kb when you like you could write an server which renders the html need on that external script resource link using per the flashebmed script using ever y flash you want to embed on a some useful properties like name use the control in your pages this way for	
	
would continue using nant because you are already using if you were using and wanted to know why would you switch to then the answer is theres no real reason to at least you know msbuild isnt going nant hasnt been updated since december	
	
would definitely advocate to have qa review not only the releases that go to the but also some intermediate maybe every two weeks or once per is in accordance with the principle to check your product as early in the development process as if you are only doing it when you are releasing a you are doing it too i would give them the debug with asserts enabled for those early you have an assert in the code that you have an either the code is or the either you want qa to test for	
	
would definitely go with something closer to the second it does seem like more messages passed back and but if your application grows and you will be happy that built the application with small where is the logic to handle mundane tasks like switching between executing them and processing the data for algorithms operate on some kind of input or starting you would get this from your data access you need seed data or initialization what about saving your results to file and retrieving them for review i would think that you need to do this once your application expect that at first you will use file based if feeling up to later you can upgrade to a if you code against an abstracted data persistence you have to change business logic later to support the change from file to should use the strategy pattern to implement your this will allow you to change the implementation of your solver from genetic algorithm to your other algorithms without having to change the business logic for each business layer will see a isolver that takes and you will call you should be able to switch between the different versions without having to change your business layer logic closed the only difference in the way the business logic should interact with the algorithms should be in the and even you should consider using a factory	
	
would definitely look for something like firebug for ie must be something out and then have a this too scientific an basically just but sure if the problem is something small like you could get to the bottom of it in no time this way good	
	
would definitely return a 500 error with a json object describing the error similar to an ajax error i believe this is fairly definitely nice to have that consistency when handling potentially unexpected error why not just use the built in functionality in if writing it in wcf and asmx services make it easy to serialize data as without reinventing the	
	
would depend on the platform and game i did once similar things for helicopter flash as it was very simple 2d game with well defined colored was on widows with copy to clipboard and win32 key events using win32api bindings for	
	
would ditch the function in favour of a for loop since it is i would also add some waits using the but only every so often and only if you want to wait for 5ms each time because then processing 3500 records would take approx is an example using a for loop that processes 100 records can tweak at 5 ms intervals which gives a 175 ms xmlelements length index process for index var toprocess perform xml if 1 length index 100 would also benchmark the different parts of the xml processing to see if there is a bottleneck somewhere that may be you can benchmark in firefox using profiler and by writing out to the console like start t new some xml to new t this	
	
would do store the time of the last modification in the edit compare this time on submission with the time stored in the if they are the lock the update the data with the modification and unlock the if the times are notify the user about it and ask for the next	
	
would essentially write the same as you static this int32 return checked it with one of my entity framework models and it i assumed a simple many to one relationship as your code note that this is a bit confusing many parents for one could it be that you have a many to many one parent might have many childs and one child might have multiple then the proeprty in your would be a collection and the code must be changed as static this int32 return third posibility is one parent with many the second method will work for this case but always return at most one parent assuming the child ids are	
	
would expect foreach to work nominally faster in some and the about same in except in cases where the items are an actual array in which case the performace difference is it is implemented on top of an it be more efficient than a straight depending on unlikely to be less for if someone exposed a balanced tree as both indexable and then foreach will be decently this is because each index will have to independently find the referenced while an enumerator has the context of the current node to more efficiently navigate to the next you have an actual then it depends on the implementation of the language and class whether foreach will be faster for the same as indexing is a literal memory as then for should be marginally faster since avoiding a function if indexing is an indirection just like a then it should be the that being i find it hard to find a case for generalization this is the last sort of optimization you should be looking even if there is a performance problem in your if you have a performance problem that can be solved by changing how you you really have a performance you have a because someone wrote either a really crappy or a really crappy	
	
would expect is set to and is set to but i checked	
	
would from ul join is your tables and upc upc left join upc is	
	
would go with a only issue would probably be saving the positions of	
	
would go with number you could even make a user control that calculates the link ahead of time and cache it per user to reduce	
	
would go with the idea of a field containing your comma other logical separated just make sure that your field is going to be big enough to hold your maximum array then when you pull the field it should be easy to perform an on the long string using your which will then immediately populate your array in the	
	
would go with the surrogate but you may want to have a computed column that the surrogate key into a more value if that improves your the computed colum could produce example 2 from the surrogate key for instance for display think the surrogate key route is the way to go and the only exceptions that i make for it are join where the primary key could be composed of the foreign key even in these cases finding that having a surrogate primary key is more useful than	
	
would have a look at which will build a dom tree from any html even the most use xpath and iterate over the nodelist returned

would just do a for and replace it with you have access to the original	
	
would just do an ajax form much	
	
would just print a and it option would be a regular is print	
	
would keep them some questions have a lot of activity and and you really like to identify if you are not interested in the difference right an extra field in the table is not that so it does not hurt to separate because if you want to add it there is no way you can retrieve the data if it is not stored also assume so keeps separate votes for cw and non cw because if the question changes to cw later even with a the original rep is	
	
would like a page that displays a list of nodes can do this part with the views and then also displays the details of a single node below the ideally the details will update via ajax when a node in the list is but reloading the page would be fine for a just starting to get into drupal and the number of levels at which i can do stuff is somewhat for example should this be a view page with a customised block at the a page with two blocks for the list one for the if so how would they communicate the node is there already a module that will do this for maybe i should write my own and so if anyone with a better general understanding of drupal could point me in the right direction it would be for the answers so i think they point out that i missed out an important detail in my original question some more would like this page to effectively be a home as such my view is restricted to showing nodes that editing the default node page would give me the problem of which node to send the user to when they log in may be possible i and also would mean that i presumably view the node without also seeing the have been trying another tack which is to create page node which includes the view using some i have also set the view control to create a link for each node in the list and include the node id in that link 13 is the node id of the page i have created and 12 is the node id of the item in the the find the second print this but sure a more drupal way of doing things the query string parsing is a nasty to display a list of nodes and details of a single node in

would not be but you can setup the open source version of the google code review tool previously noted by which is named it runs on google you could host this yourself using the appengine sdk and though i recommend this if the site is to be publicly visible as the sdk clearly notes that it is not meant for production and as such security is lightly google has also released a tool for converting appengine applications into pure django which you could then host via your favorite python web run on top of the demo application conversion included is actually rietveld so they have already taking care of this for see here for more	
	
would not consider this a part of the but rather of the controller on top of events or observer patterns to a model adds complexity in other such as which you will want to it the responsibility of the class that makes the not the model the responsibility is to contain the not imply the business	
	
would not create a thread for every inserted instead i would have a single cleanup thread or use a timer when the thread wakes up it can walk through the list cleaning up old would also overide the index operator and any other accessor methods to not allow items that should be cleaned up but have not yet	
	
would not use this method of conditionally inserting line if there is a possibility of something that might be a single line or use an html element that is used for and preventing but use the intended this could making them either or could also use but that caused side effects like float clearing that add nothing to your specific best to use the correct html and proper classnames and css to get the markup that you for some ideas on this	
	
would place the delay on the server validation portion where it attempt to validate back automatically as false have a message saying the user has to wait so many seconds before making another another answer until so many seconds have doing the will prevent one browser from making another but it stop a distributed attack where someone has multiple programs trying to login as the user possibility is that the time between attempts varies by how many attempts are made to so the second attempt they have a one second the third is maybe the third is 4 and so that way you have a legitimate user having to wait 15 seconds between login attempts because they mistyped their password incorrectly the first	
	
would prefer to use an instance but choose the name to reflect the fact that it change the existing for static methods becomes tiresome pretty if you make it clear to your users that the type is they should get the hang of that pretty everyone gets tripped up by not actually replacing anything in the target but they keep making the same with better names you should be asked a about to an immutable list the best solution there imo is to use rather than it imply that the original value is you may find other answers to that question	
	
would probably go for case a few thousand rows a days is a small amount of not something you should worry this sounds like a one of those cases where you just get it working and worry about performance later could probably never clear it out and still never run into	
	
would probably override the and methods on the controller class basecontroller controller called before the action is public override void start called after the action is public override void stop	
	
would probably split them out into multiple features so that you can updat ethem seperately if need you could always create a parent feature which has activationdependencies on the child if you mark the child features the parent feature will automatically activate the child features and they clutter up your features	
	
would probably use executereader to create an object in code from the the reason for this is that the datatable has more overhead than a because it has more functionality was probably created by a since you doing using the you need the being i would make a static helper method in the bookmanager static ibook book b new return reason for this is because the reason you have an interface is because you might want to change the you may eventuallu have inovel ireference ibook etc and then want to have an abstract factory implementation in your data static ibook sqlcommand command new or dr checking case return case return benefit of the dal here is that you can cache you can have a dictionary that holds books looked to reduce extra db calls on objects already when an update takes you remove the cached another post using multiple interfaces and helper methods will need to reside in a neutral right now in the there is movement towards less which means less is a link from a blog i read on this i think the answer is that the data layer returns an instance of your interface to the business luck

would rethink the need for you are using you are suggesting that is a if is always a methods that work on should also work on this the i would rework this as a private bar should always be a to take this one step further you could do things would get very you could have situations mybar new this is what should this declared a but is acutally a can actually force this behavior using i think a bad but could check the type of and if it throw an this would be very and have a very bad in response to is no way for the compiler to enforce what you are if you really want to force the compiler to check and prevent you really should consider making foo a sealed you could use other extension methods than subclassing in this you might want to consider using events or delegates to extend the behavior instead of allowing the object to be to do what you are accomplishing is basically trying to prevent the main goals of

would second the notion that you may wish to consider a subclass instead of the approach not knowing your specific ymmv thinking of is a the function in a metaclass is passed the full proposed definition of the which it can then rewrite before the class is you at that sub out the constructor for a new def return def the constructor is perhaps a bit but the language does provide support for this kind of deep introspection and dynamic

would skip the database for reasons listed a simple hash in memory will perform about as fast a lookup in the if the database was a bit faster for the still wasting time with the db having to parse the query and create a plan for the then assemble the results and send them back to your plus you can save yourself a you plan on moving other parts of your program to a persistent then go for but a hashmap should be sufficient for your

would suggest for turbogears they have done a fantastic job of integrating best of python assuming you are developing moderately complex business solutions in tg2 or some other framework say even though these frameworks supports wsgi does that mean one who is using these frameworks have to learn in most cases answer is i mean good have this knowledge no knowledge is probably is more useful in cases want to use some middleware or some other component which is not provided as part of the standard stack for authkit with tg or without are doing some is good but think of handling your database at the end of exposing validations in such cases django like frameworks do it all for	
	
would suggest having an init be method on your you would run this method on your application start for each of your in that case you can wrap it in try catch and act your throwing exceptions in places like shared constructor is bad idea you really catch hard to predict when the init will be called case you specify add either isinitialized field that would be checked and an exception thrown when calling that requires it can get tedious other option i would go for might be far from your current in many ioc tools they use concept of startable you specify an interface with a start method and the ioc will make sure the method runs at specified time likely when application is you would do your error handling in your method and bubble up whatever wrapped exception with all the detailed could elaborate on this but i have feeling not really the way you would	
	
would suggest instead of trying to parse xml you try to create classes that would deserialize from the xml into the i would recommend following if you cannot do there is you can use static t return use like	
	
would suggest that you not use from based at least not without some additional credentials way too easy to and certainly not difficult if you know email you echo the email back to the user for you can make things a little more but realize that your service can end up being used as a sort of spamming could send 100 upload requests to with a forged from and go ahead and spam the real person with 100 confirmation

would suspect the confusion arises over how interfaces were implemented in as abstract classes and multiple and interface is simply a contract that says you will implement those code compile for the same reason this code wont would with interface void abstract class foo is declaring that foo implements it say anything else about you wanted to force derived classes to implement it you would interface void abstract class foo public abstract void if you really wanted the interface methods hidden by explicit then something like n8wrl posted

would the server know when the browser is closed or the tab at that point the browser send anything to the is a fundamental part of http a not a open where you can tell if one party leaves the think of it as a series of telegrams rather than a phone call and you tell when received the last telegram going to need to design your way round this to avoid to know when the browser has been there are some ugly hacks to work around it making ajax poll the server with a heartbeat for example but changing the design is a better

would use a binary tree if you want to be able to efficiently find something in a sorted just the same as in any other data structure choice is important in any it become less important in higher level except to the degree that the higher level language provides large libraries that incorporate thoughtful intelligent design that handles this for in which case you have to design the data structure but you do have to know which data structure to java collections framework is extensive and but if you make use of the wrong collections your performance will some data structures are more than memory is cheap and modern languages will manage memory for but if you are handling huge sets of then data structures will matter if you can make something more

writing some optimized c code that basically runs through an array and does something to each what it does depends on the current value of the element so something i if else if 2 else returning to c after many years working in dynamic where my practice has been to try to write straightforward code and not create lots of local variables for things that i can just refer to like am very much aware that best practices are to write readable code and trust that the compiler is smarter than you and will do good i were writing the code above in i would load into a register once and then just use that value each time because i know that is private memory and change between even a smart compiler might do a load every time because it be sure that the memory do i have to explicitly declare volatile for the compiler to not make this my question should i expect better performance by rewriting with a local variable like i val if else if 2 else does stuff like take care of this automatically for the code optimizing takes days to so even modest improvements will make a i store c array values in local variables if going to reference them

wrong with cursors is that they are often both in and in are for keeping a stable resultset which you can retrieve they are implicitly created when your query is and closed when course keeping such a resultset requires some even faster these resources are the a cursor open is like keeping a fridge door do it for hours without but it does not mean you should never open your means get your results and sum you call the execute whole query and get the first results from the you append a condition to your for processing your cursors inside a procedure requires infamous context which happens every time you get a result of an query out of the involves passing large amounts of data between threads and synchronizing the is one of the most irritating things in of the less evident consequences of that behaviour is that triggers in oracle should be avoided if a trigger and calling a function is equal to opening the cursor selecting the updated rows and calling the trigger code for each row of this existence of the trigger the empty may slow down a operation or test script on create table int not 2 in 2 into 3 select 4 from 5 connect 6 level 7 rows in 2 in 0 truncate table 2 in 3 create trigger 2 after 3 on 4 for each 5 6 7 8 in 2 into 3 select 4 from 5 connect 6 level 7 rows in seconds without a seconds with an empty trigger doing

wrote this answer back in when android was relatively and there were many not well established areas in android i have added a long addendum at the bottom of this addressing some and detailing a large philosophical disagreement i have with those who encourage the use of singletons rather than subclassing read it at your own more general problem you are encountering is how to save state across several activities and all parts of your a static variable a is a common java way of achieving i have found that a more elegant way in android is to associate your state with the application you each activity is also a which is information about its execution environment in the broadest your application also has a and android guarantees that it will exist as a single instance across your way to do this is to create your own subclass of and then specify that class in the application tag in your now android will automatically create an instance of that class and make it available for your entire you can access it from any using the method also provides a method which has the exact same myapp extends application private string public string return public void mystate blah extends activity public void myapp appstate string state has essentially the same effect as using a static variable or but integrates quite well into the existing android note that this will not work across processes your app be one of the rare ones that has multiple also as anticafe in order to correctly tie your application override to your application a tag is necessary in the manifest see the android docs for more an user608578 asks below how this works with managing native object i admit i am not up to speed on using native code with android in the and i am not qualified to answer how that would interact with my if someone does have an answer to i am willing to credit them and put the information in this post for maximum some people have this is a solution for something i perhaps should have emphasized more in the original this is not meant to be a solution for saving user or other information that is meant to be persisted across application i consider most criticism below related to applications being killed at any as anything that ever needed to be persisted to disk should not be stored through an application it is meant to be a solution for storing easily application state a user is logged in for and components which are single instance network manager for in has been kind enough to point out an interesting with reto meier and diane in which use of application subclasses is discouraged in favor of singleton somatik also pointed out something of this nature although i see it at the because of reto and roles in maintaining the android i cannot in good faith recommend ignoring their what they to a certain i do wish to disagree extremely strongly with the diane in expressed with regards to preferring singleton over application in my disagreement i will be making use of concepts best explained in stackexchange explanation of the singleton design so that i do not have to define terms in this i highly encourage skimming the link before point by states the is no reason to subclass from it is no different than making a this first claim is there are two main reasons for the application class provides a better lifetime guarantee for an application it is guaranteed to have the lifetime of the a singleton is not explicitly tied to the lifetime of the application it is this may be a for your average application but i would argue this is exactly the type of contract the android api should be and it provides much more flexibility to the android system as by minimizing the lifetime of associated the application class provides the application developer with a single instance holder for which is very different from a singleton holder of for a list of the see the singleton explanation link likely to be something you regret in the future as you find your application object becoming this big tangled mess of what should be independent application this is certainly not but this is not a reason for choosing singleton over application in fact it is telling to me that none of arguments provide a single reason that using a singleton is better than an application all she attempts to establish is that using a singleton is no worse than an application which i believe is also comments that using an application subclass is likely to be something you regret in the future as you find your application object becoming this big tangled mess of what should be independent application as before this is not but only further points out that there is no concrete benefit to using a singleton instead of an application subclass in this she this leads more naturally to how you should be managing these things initializing them on this ignores the fact that there is no reason you cannot initialize on demand using an application subclass as again there is no ends with framework itself has tons and tons of singletons for all the little shared data it maintains for the such as caches of loaded pools of it works i am not arguing that using singletons cannot work fine or are not a legitimate i am arguing that singletons do not provide as strong a contract with the android system as using an application and further that using singletons generally points to extremely inflexible which is not easily and leads to many problems down the the strong contract the android api offers to developer applications is one of the most appealing and pleasing aspects of programming with and helped lead to early developer adoption which drove the android platform to the success it has suggesting using singletons is implicitly moving away from a strong api and in my weakens the android that diane has not explained a single downside to using an application and has not proven that using a singleton is better in any i cannot agree with any of her it may be that she has not fully explained her but i cannot see any downside to using an application subclass which would counter the numerous downsides to i do not argue that singletons cannot work but i do argue that they are generally the product of either a bad api or a lazy i disagree quite strongly with which i feel is a terrible basis for an i leave you with the following list of downsides to as stolen from the stackexchange to use abstract or interface to coupling across the application to to test in unit to parallelize in the case of mutable state extensive add my and unmanageable lifetime contract unsuited for android most	
	
wrote this before your clarifying comment so it probably quite is not sure if a lookup table approach is possible or if you really need arbitrary then take advantage of the a solution is i believe that the following is what you are looking for is something like the it probably contains bugs in edge but it does compile and work as expected at least for positive making it really work is an exercise for the convert a numerical string of base a printable binary int int generates a printable binary representation of an input from an arbitrary the input number is passed as the character string the input string consists of from the ascii character set letter characters may be in either upper or lower the number of characters from the input string which consumed by this the output string is placed newly allocated storage which is pointed to by upon an error is signalled by returning const int char int rc char char unsigned long num if then we have some numbers int numdig rc we have this many base we need this many base 2 digits if return return the buffer outp make sure it is nul terminated while fill it in from lsb to msb num return

you are wrong about the enterprise portion of your are acceptable in an enterprise the issue is typically with knowledge of the dataset and the mistaken idea that be able to write your more all before you start recreating common like filtering for your object unit of work a different question than scaling to millions of likely that you want to trim any of the which requires you customize all your data going poco probably is not the right with still mapping structures to a database in a separate adding extra logic that when scaled to a high level starts showing wear and tear on your need to provide a more specific set of questions to get a better but does not necessarily equal of etc lend themselves to quick development of unsupported as well as maintainability because of of the model used in the app and the wide adoption and understanding most but to support millions of likely going to sacrifice maintainability for performance and scalability design you just need to make the decision which are more typed datasets are saying typed datasets are faster than is like saying i can run but with this name tag i can run be careful to investigate unsupported claims about any particular tool and ask for a

you asking if you can find out before you call malloc how many bytes are available for you to the answer is even if you the answer may not be very valuable to the reason why is you can never know how much memory is you can only know how much memory this is a very important distinction because it has an affect on the way you can properly utilize an lets assume there was such a function called this code looks correct but is horribly size size no need to check the answer because there is enough p reason why is that some other thread could come in between the if statement and the malloc statement and do own that could reduce the overal memory in the system and hence change worse is the available amount of memory in the system does not determine how much memory can be allocated with important for malloc any other memory alloc is how much contiguous memory is

you design a there will be methods exposed to the outer you should check the incoming data in this no checks are required in methods that you do not because only your code calls them and its logic should handle all cases you accepted in the exposed method library outer library library entry world method helpers you have accepted the supplied data in the entry you should perform the requested action and return the exspected that is handle all remaining clearify the situation inside the there might be null but only because of the not because of parameter there are two possibilties for the location of null checks inside the the first one if the called method knows how to handle null if do do something the second situation if you call a method that cannot handle null if do the work myself or call another do whole idea is to reject cases you cannot handle immideatly and handle remaining cases if the input is not valid you throw an this forces the library caller to supply only valid values and does not allow the caller to continue execution with meaningless return values the caller shallows the exception an

you do protest too state on several occasions in the post that what you are proposing is ethical and you see nothing wrong with what you are about to an despite apparently being so sure of yourself you post it i can only see two motives for your protestations you do think it may be unethical and you are looking for support to back up your assertion that it do feel ethical but you recognise that other people may feel it is unethical and you want to reassure yourself that this will not be a widely held either case you recognise that there is a question over your proposed behaviour otherwise you would not post the and by posting you therefore yourself answer the question to your own mind your proposed behaviour or will be perceived to be by some ethically the real question you have to answer is is the degree of risk in choosing to take a course of action that you recognise as being ethically dubious to some degree justified by the potential this is a question only you can answer there is a risk for instance that your manager will be so off with you that you are sacked with a bad reference and will have great difficulty in finding another otoh success with the idea may mean you need to be looking for another

you have a zip code database with you could calculate the distance on the fly with my haversine function my to this performs very well in web apps with the entire us zip code query would look like something similar to from zip where 20 would not apply this to each but you would determine the zip codes within your radius first an nested or with a and then join in all the addresses that you need to send a mail

you have an index on the then all the values are in the index and the dbms never has to look in the it just looks in the index which just has 10 if this is mostly read only then cache it in caching helps scalability and a lot by relieving the database of a query that is quick on a database with no might perform poorly if a 30 queries are going on at the same	
	
you have an infinite rewrite the your you need to resolve editname to editid look it up in some table you the rewrite module know which name maps to which id you make a separate rule for each which scale at so the rewrite module passes the name as to your and it is the responsibility to find out which id is

you have consider using a a trie is a structure that merges the common prefixes of the stored if the strings were trie would strings requires 57 characters the null for plus whatever the size of the string object that holds we should probably round all sizes up to multiples of call it 57 5 62 trie requires 29 the null for plus sizeof the trie which are a ref to an array and a list of child trie this that probably comes out about the for it probably comes out less as long as you do have common when using the trie in other have to convert to probably using a stringbuffer as an if many of the strings are in use at once as outside the a if only using a few at the time to look up things in a dictionary the trie can save you a lot of definitely less space than storing them in a say accessing them if that means sequentially an the trie also obviously gives you alphabetical order for if you iterate it	
	
you have control of the class you wish to consider using a static factory method so you can give them two separate names and avoid the static foo static foo string decide what your null is it a null array of or a null possible that the class you are constructing behaves differently given one over the once you know what your null simply cast it to that type in the call to the it sounds like you might be passing an object reference to this constructor instead of an explicit perhaps something getting from a if you could test this object with and cast to the appropriate type before sending it on to the constructor in	
	
you have enough memory allocated for use in the innodb buffer or for use by you can read the database into memory a from and if no reason to remove it stays also get better key as the memory table only does rather than full btree which for keys might be fats or not so much with such a large the best thing to do it to benchmark idea if you are using to use an archive table which can be and may also speed access to the if they are easily this swaps the cpu time to for

you have imagemagick you can do 200x100 200x10 is most likely possible with the imagemagick plugin if you have this may create a larger filesize though a smaller dimensions image due to coalescing essentially deoptimizing the you have imagemagick you should be able to use a combination of the following steps to resize an animated gif you have gd if the image is an animated i detect animated gifs using php and the animated gif into individual the individual the frames into an animated gif is definitely much more intensive than the imagemagick but it should be technically you get it please share with the	
	
you have is that you have tags whose counts are from min to the threshold issue can be ignored here because it amounts to setting every count below threshold to the threshold value and taking the minimum and maximum only want to map the tag counts to but in a which basically means i understand the the tags with count max get weight your the tags with the count min get weight your it holds that when your count decreases by the weight is multiplied with a constant k which indicates the steepness of the we that with x the exponent is zero and the multiplicand on the right becomes we have the extra requirement that and we can which we taking logarithm on both ln k ln ln k ln right hand side is negative as because k ln now you have the formula to calculate after this you just apply for any count x between min and you are	
	
you have many you might want to try a suffix tree insert all the words from the three data storing which list each word comes from in terminating then you can perform queries on the tree for each keyword really suffix trees are very complicated to	
	
you have not found the code to be the slow part of the application via a profiler then you do anything about it it is but the code is and is and there are other slower areas that you can work on speeding up do those it is buggy then you need to fix it go for the hash table as it will be faster than the this assumes that the order that the data is traversed does not if you care about what the insertion order is then stick with the list can do things with a hash table and keep the but that will make the code much that you need to search the list only on occasion the odds of this being a significant bottleneck in your code is data structure to look at is a which basically lets you skip over a large portion of the this requires that the list be sorted depending on what you are may make the code slower

you have the source of the external assembly then you can compile it with an attribute pointing at your this is not a perfect solution and i often use it for unit testing rather than production code but it may be something worth looking all you would need to do is add the following to the in your is then you have to put the fully qualified name of the assembly including the entire public key just the

you have to make changes to the api which already has some probably the best route is to deprecate the old api calls and encourage use of the new the capability of the old api calls would probably break the functionality of old so that is probably going to cause some developers using your api to become somewhat your language provides ways to indicate that certain functionality has been it can serve as a indication for the users to stop using old api calls and transition to new calls in the javadoc can provide notes in the documentation that a feature has been or from java 5 the can be used to raise warnings on calls to deprecated apis it would probably be a good idea to provide some tips and hints on migrating from the old api to the new api to encourage people to use the new way of interacting with the having examples and sample code on what to do and what not to the users of the api would be able to write code according to the preferred going to be difficult to change a public but with some care taken in the transition from the old to i believe that it the amount of pain inflicted on the users of the api can be mitigated to a certain an article on and when to deprecate from which might provide some more information on when it would be appropriate to deprecate parts of thank you to david schmitt who added that the in is similar to the annotation in the edit was overwritten by my as we were both editing this answer at the same

you have two bounding boxes with some arbitrary orientation i assume means some then i would do the at an initial position i assume the bounding boxes are not translate each box forward based on its velocity applying movements over the coordinates of the corners of each translated bounding these 4 coordinates define the endpoints of the 4 line segments that make up the edges of the bounding bounding box test for an intersection between each of its line segments and the 4 line segments of bounding box you can do this using standard equations for computing the intersection point of two as discussed for there was an figure out the fraction of a move that was successful using the coordinates of the intersection points and the known translation you the above steps for each a rough pseudocode what was discussed in the would look as for intersections between the obb any intersections are code for when obbs are partially p line segment whose endpoints are the obb for intersections between p and obb if p intersects edges of both code for when obbs are not code for when one obb is completely inside the	
	
you have two groups of radio buttons that you want to function as one group of radio the solution is make it one group of radio only problem you have then is that the value that you get has the same name from both but that can be solved by adding a prefix to the values so that you easily identify from which list the option	
	
you have two that you want to ignore a file that changed and that you want to add a bunch of files to subversion at solve the first problem you should use the previous suggestion propedit enter the name of the file into the editor that comes up on the environment this will most likely be or nano by make sure to save your changes to this file or it solve the second just loop over the files in your working copy via svn add in a bash equivalent terminal emulator it add something already under version control and you can safely ignore the warnings it gives the better solution would be to write a quick script to check if something is in svn first and only add it if but i think for what doing it might be a waste of add the root directory of your project and after checking to make sure happy with the the commit command will find all your changes the ones in and send them off to your

you mentioned you using recursion but each function has a logical path that calls to the the this can get you in a lot of trouble if your tree is large enough to blow your gcc has limited support for tail but i count on when you delete a child with two you promote the left or right node to the position the deleted node was is a highly simplistic assuming your tree delete code has some recommend walking through it with a few hypothetical immediately obvious to me was a pointer and then deferencing you can always worry about style once you get the correctness thing squared

you need a collection of then an array may well be the best tool for the boxing is a comparatively expensive for a collection including of primitives that will be used as i almost always use an array to avoid repeated boxing and rarely worry about the performance difference between an array and an if a will provide more maintainable then i will always use a or as but your question was about unless there is some compelling reason not performance is that compelling almost always results in better in part because arrays play nice with as johannes already pointed out in a but also because of so many other have a very rich api and a large variety of implementations that can most be trivially swapped in and out for each collection can be trivially converted to an if use of an array version is collections grow more gracefully than an array which can be a performance work very well with arrays fairly tofubeer pointed array covariance is strange and can act in unexected ways that no object will act collections handle covariance in expected need to be manually sized to their and if an array is not full you need to keep track of that if an array needs to be you have to do that of this i rarely use arrays and only a little more often use an i do use very often just or my most frequent use of arrays is when the item being stored is a primitive and will be inserted and accessed and used as a if boxing and unboxing every become so fast that it becomes a trivial i may revisit this but it is more convenient to work with to store in the form in which it is always instead of

you successfully serialized your linq 2 sql objects for i tried this see below as to it really fell there were relationships in my l2s entity pointing to and then the child pointing back to the parent and obviously when enumerating for building the wcf it could not traverse the tree infinitely in this fashion and the best i it resulted in an overflow so what i am basically saying is beware if you go down this up on i would suggest transforming your wcf objects to model kind glad the above did not as i would always prefer to make a custom wcf object which transports a clean subset of exactly what the wcf request needs and it then include a stack of superfluous data to be sent across the and sure your l2s entities have lots of the actual reason i tried sending my l2s data directly across the wire was because i had to make an engine which employed certain these rules were stored in a correlation of about 4 database tables with relationships and it was not viable to upkeep a separate wcf in the end what i ended up doing was extending custom code gen classes to include with and then cloned property for property the l2s classes wcf custom worked perfectly in the end and this is the procedure i used with instructions on my am happy with this and feel there is bad practice hope this

you there are many do most seem to read threads as os threads used by since you mentioned erlang in your like to post a more this kind of simulation with processes micro green as they are sometimes necessarily need any in we have a couple of likely thousands or hundreds of physics objects that need to be we want to simulate these objects as realistically as but there is probably also some kind of real time aspect involved have to be you mention this in your simple solution would be to spawn of an erlang process for each sent ticks to all of them and collect the results of the simulation before proceeding with the next this is in practice synchronizing it is of course more of a deterministic solution and does not guarantee any real time it is also how the processes would talk to each other to get the data they need for the you probably need to group them in clever ways groups have hibernated processes erlang has neat support for sleeping etc to speed things get real time properties you probably need to restrain the calculations performed by the processes accuracy for this could perhaps be done by sending out ticks waiting for and letting the object processes reply back to each tick with their current position and other data you need though it might only be approximated at the as this could lead to errors accumulating in the guess in one the question is really about if it is possible to use the strength of concurrency to gain some kind of advantage if you need it is a quite strong sign that you do not need concurrency between each physics because you essentially throw away a lot of computation time by waiting for other you might use concurrency during calculation but that is another i none of these ideas take the actual physics calculations into this is not erlang strong side and could perhaps be performed in a c library or whatever strikes your depending on the type of characteristics you i do not know of any case where this has been done not by so i cannot guarantee that this is sound

you use static arrays you have access to the size of array using sizeof if put it into you can pass it to function by reference and passing argument by reference and by pointer is the same on assembly level almost sure of if you use dynamic you know the size of array at compile so you can store this value in but you will also store only a pointer to array in foo int int you can pass this structure by but what you realy do is passing pointer to int to and int of my opinion it help you the only thing that is in is that you store the size and the array in one place and it is easy to get the size of the if you will use a lot of dynamic arrays you can do it this but if you will use few easier will be not to use

you want an atomic increment in you can use libraries or something like was once a time that the gnu coding guidelines said updating datatypes that fit in one word was but that advice is wrong for smp for some and wrong when using an optimizing clarify the is possible for two cpus on an smp machine to write to the same memory location in the same and then try to propagate the change to the other cpus and the even if only one word of data is being written so the writes only take one cycle to they also happen simultaneously so you cannot guarantee which write you get partially updated but one write will disappear because there is no other way to handle this properly coordinates between multiple but there is no reason to believe that every variable assignment of datatypes will use while an optimizing compiler affect a is it can change the causing serious trouble if you expect your reads and writes to happen in the same order they appear in the source code most famous being locking does not work in vanilla my original answer also said that intel 64 bit architecture was broken in dealing with 64 bit that is not so i edited the but my edit claimed powerpc chips were is true when reading immediate values into the two sections named under listing 2 and listing but there is an instruction for loading data from memory in one cycle so removed that part of my

you want to process an xml document in its parsing xml into a dom will almost always be the least efficient in terms of deserialisation cpu usage and memory to a dom requires around times the amount of memory as the xml document requires disk for a 1 megabyte xml document will parse into a dom taking up megabytes of ever parse into a dom if you intend to modify some or all of the data and then put the result back into an xml for all other use dom is a poor is often significantly less resource but this does depend on the length of the document how many elements you and the location in the document of the data in which you are memory usage and completion time tends to increase the further down the document you for say you have an xml document with childnode each childnode has a unique identifier that you know in and you want to extract a known childnode from the extracting the childnode would use much more memory than extracting the if you are using xpath to extract all childnode you may find it less efficient than parsing into a xpath is generally an easy way of extracting a portion of an xml not recommend using it for processing all of an xml far the best if you are indeed looking to extract and process all data in an xml would be to use a this will be both orders of magnitude faster and less resource heavy than any other it does also depend on the volume of data you are dealing for the example xml document you you notice any practical dom will be and sax will be but talking or can easily be hundreds or thousands of times faster than however if the difference between 2 microseconds and 2 milliseconds not going to when dealing with a document containing childnode 2 seconds versus 200 seconds will become more of a

your rss feed is over http then basic http authentication would probably do the this would either be done at the web server level iis for or via whatever framework using to produce the feed for authentication scheme kerberos is up to if using wcf to produce the feed then these decisions are things you can make later and apply via config if you simply looking to authenticate consumers of the or also encrypt it to prevent the information from being read by a in the if you require encryption then ssl is probably the easiest to should avoid simply the rss feed by changing question sounds like actually having issues with the rss client on the you need to determine whether the phones rss client understands how to deal with authentication it is there anything in the http request that could allow you to associate a device with a is there an http header that gives you a unique device if you might be able to then perform a lookup against this data to perform your own but you should remember that this sort of authentication could be the device have a client certificate that could be used for mutual if then that would be
