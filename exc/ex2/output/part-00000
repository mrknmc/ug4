1 x y your and are very so is going to be smaller way too small to influence the results of your so as far as 1 x means you can store the numbers with 1 and instead of just add them as long as the results are always much less than be close enough to the mathematically precise results that you care about the just you say of them are very close to obviously this technique work for numbers that are not close to 1 that if and are but if one is large and one is it might still you only care about the magnitude of the product if both numbers are not close to you can just use regular java

2 other answers have the dpi settings may be giving you i have found that mixing with px sizing can be a real challenge once you consider dpi settings and different browser default now i just use px for font most of the problems go force that single user back to the regular i willing to bet that they are need reading glasses and the new high res monitor they got was harder to read because the print was so someone adjusted the dpi and now the fonts are the same size as the old so now they really do like the new monitor the problem now is some web pages are messed where you come thing you might want to look at when changing monitors from a crt to flat screen is the digital font smoothing fuzzy characters become this does not affect your web to address point raised by makes some excellent points in his context certainly answer was a bit lazy and the reason i use px is because of the inconsistency across to my way of specifying a point size should specify the physical size of the character to the user on the device he is but in practice it does suppose you most browsers under this defaults to the much maligned ie7 decided to use some other default and that font seems smaller and less readable in the same point the same can be said of arial verdana specify the same point and your whole layout throw in dpi settings on setup and it is setting is a bit of an your monitor or phone has a fixed you can only change it if you get a new monitor or having a dialog box to change the dpi is there only because the device does not report to the operating system what the dpi an imperfect i leave you with this suggestion use px for now to specify the font but only use it make all other sizes relative to your base when you have to port everything over to the latest blackberry or ipod that does a better job of switching from 11px to 11pt will be and test out your software so it does look nice as you boost the font	
200 that probably it should be a 30x status rather than 200 see is best for the response to a and should be a complete absolute your script just says without the 30x cgi servers will usually do an internal redirect by fetching the new url and returning it without telling the browser anything funny this may sound like what you want but it really because from the point of view no different from the original script returning a 200 and direct that would cause a the browser will request url practice probably not as bad as you thanks to the client should be able to respond to the redirect straight away the next as long as on the same there any way that will tell the browser to request when i hit f5 instead of post submission stick with the model for solving

a look at reactive there are a number of frameworks for this in haskell know about other most of which are based around the basic idea is to represent relationships between values and so for example you would write haskell arrow notation using no particular velocity expression of gravity position integrate second line declares the relationship between position and the arrow operators are syntactic sugar for a bunch of library calls that tie everything later on you might say something groundlevel getgroundlevel altitude getaltitude crashed lifta2 altitude declare that if your altitude is less than the ground level at your position then you have just as with the other variables is not just a single its a stream of that is why the function is used to the comparison operator from simple values to is not a problem in this inputs are time varying values such as joystick x and while the image on the screen is simply another time varying at the very top level your entire simulator is an arrow from the inputs to the then you call a function that converts the arrow into an io action that runs the you write this in lisp you will probably find yourself creating a bunch of macros that basically so it might be worth just finding out about arrows to start

a plaecbo effect splitting a developer between two projects in the manner described gives the impression that work is being completed on both projects the same whilst in reality probably a lot more since context switching and other considerations carries a cost time and one it can get the ball rolling on things like requirement clarifications and similar tasks the developer can switch to the alternate project when they are and it can also lead to early input from other business if you have one resource then you have a natural best thing you can do for that lone developer is to intercept from distracting that and try to carry some of the burdon around chasing clarifications and handling user feedback

a slightly simplistic certainly true that there is an overhead to data modifications due to the presence of but you ought to consider the relative number of reads and writes to the in general the number of reads is far higher than the number of and you should take that into account when defining an indexing it comes to which columns to index e always felt that the designer ought to know the business well enough to be able to take a very good first pass at which columns are likely to other then that it really comes down to feedback from the and system monitoring with extensive internal metrics on performance to capture

about this a little you can do it in although it will take some extra stuff that will add some could use some sort of universal hashing scheme so that you can build a good hash by the instance each and throw it into a doubly linked node of some insert each node into the when you check if the parent child are in the hashtable and link when you are start at the head you should be able to figure out in the first walk the list and add it to your linkedlist or just use the resulting doubly linked takes one pass that is and the hashtable takes to initialize and inserts are problem left for you is choosing a good hashtable implementation that will give you those you have to consider the memory as i do not know how many results you hopefully enough to keep in know of or think there is an sql query based but my sql knowledge is very this

accepted answer is a little you use the returned by that can be anywhere in your assuming you can see the variable which has pointer returned by is equally true of any memory allocated in c or whether stack or just put in front of a local and you now have the key that allows any other part of the program to get at the storage for that and use it just as effectively as if they could see the variable name variable names are only visible inside the scope they are declared but their storage is accessible from in any assuming the address has been taken and passed and yet frequently to take the address of local variables in and so it is unfortunately impossible to use those languages effectively without understanding

after recovering a bunch of sharepoint mdf files from a san that went south due to client configuration idiocy we are now at the point where we are trying to reconnect the sql there were a handful of small databases that we recovered that mounted with no issues however the important database that holds an entire document management system is around 500gb and once we reconnected that database it came up in sql server as i read online and tried the usual steps of placing the database in emergency mode then running dbcc checkdb on that operation never finished after 12 hours and when i looked at the activity on it it seems to have i ran dbcc checkdb with and it also hung at completion after an we are going to open a ticket with ms support but just wondering what other steps i can take at this btw i am able to query the database in single user mode and see our data and image checkdb with hangs at

agree with everyone who says automated hardware is a must using that approach to test embedded software with some of our we have built up large test stations full of hardware simulators and we use ni teststand with a mix of labview vendor etc to manage all of we have to test a lot of hardware why we have all of that if just testing software then you can scale it back to the bare testing a serial just build a device to simulate the serial traffic and exercise all of the messages a few to ensure the software responds testing are plenty of usb peripherals or embedded devices to simulate if timing is important have to use another embedded device to get the tight tolerances looking otherwise a pc will do just important part is to always know what testing and not to test anything other than if make sure the test is independent of the hardware to the largest degree if testing waveform generation or something with a separate out the tasks test the hardware with a special build of software on the embedded device that do anything fancy except spit out a prearranged sequence of voltage then you can see if your references are if your filters are set to the wrong then you should be able to test the software independent of the hardware use a development board to test the software and verify behavior at the processor pins is	
agree with hard to troubleshoot if you know what exception is being listen to the and log the issue as the first step in troubleshooting	
agree with i find it hard to believe that you really want to continue execution of something after an exception has been if you then something exceptional probably has not actually another exceptions should not be used for logging or flow they should only be used when something exceptional has happened that the code at the level where the exception was thrown cannot deal i would internalize the logging messages and remove the exceptions that are being a i think you need to go back and what the code is trying to do and what business value or rules are being as peterr try to understand did we get here in the first part of the code and what exactly the exceptions

agree with john this really to answer your you basically need to rewrite the there are two ways you can do the whole file into memory with the offending line this case probably easiest to convert the string array into a then remove the all the rest of the lines back with potentially convert the into a string array again using means you have to know that got enough memory an both the input file and a new output file a with and a line if you want to delete write it to the output file read all the close both the reader and the writer you use statements for this will happen you want to replace the input with the delete the input file and then move the output file into

agree with the answer regarding unobtrusive assignment of the event but for what you could continue to use the html onmouseover attribute by passing the event object as a	
agree with the others that point out your second option is the accepted method for realizing a relationship many an background would lead you to feel that having an event foreign key column in the photo table is an uncomfortable coupling of two separate but from a relational database the way only way to preserve your first while preventing a photo from being used for multiple is to place a unique constraint on the photoid column of the relationship between eventphotos and photos would then become a which is kinda but you do gain a decoupling of photos and but many years of successful relational database design will still argue for the second

almost as if is blocking indefinitely in the driver somewhere because the stick is no longer will ultimately emit a file system irp and not using so that irp will be but it looks like where the actual file system has abruptly disappeared from underneath the file system that irp is never which means stuffed the function call which lead to the file system irp being issued will never using that will prolly get you around this at least from the point of view of not you will still be experiencing resource loss and the since the irp will still be passed down and almost certainly still be coming back but at least you be blocking on for quick is i would say designed to reduce the amount of caching that goes on and perhaps influence the order of writes to the file system to reduce the chance of i extremely doubt it is intended to preserve the file system in the event of file system departure a should not be surprised that this kills the file

alone the code that at least for you can find a code generator that really makes it to develop new then i see how it could pose a risk or be hard to to the better to generate repetitive code than to write it really just a you should find a way to extract the repetitive aspects in a way that allows you to manually write use for data access so that you have to write crud operations for each domain object and instead just specify how mapped to db

alternate approach to the visual comments there is a scheme system and associated book that has been targeted particularly at people like you with some the book to design is available free on the web and printed and the system is open upside of this sort of approach is that it is a nice clean small design with some powerful tools to get you plus a vastly better textual approach that your typical yourself x in y technical downside is that be starting off in a language that while very nicely designed is not and has a different approach that the family and related languages that dominate industry programming so while be learning with a much nicer language you have so many sources of you follow this track probably become a better programmer but be a bit when you do learn a more mainstream language or you make many of the same newbie mistakes as guess it depends a lot what your long and goals

always been interested in writing web software like forums or things which take a limited markup to rewrite into but noticed more and more that for try googling bbcode parser and test a few you either get an inefficient or you get poor code with xss holes here and my previously mentioned of the poor bbcode parsers out how would you avoid now take your typical regular expression for handling a and you can mention how vulnerable it is and how to avoid assume input has already been encoded by htmlspecialchars with image tags are hardly more secure than i have several specific mostly specific to php it better in this to only match using a validation is it better to use and a then ascertain whether or not the input is a valid as would be obvious the would work in the above url but would fail if the was about functions like within a would they be any deterrence or problem far as uri standards it be safer to write a is the time and processing power needed to develop and use such a thing too weighty for something handling several different entries per know my example is one of and is more specific than shirk from providing your looking for principles and best and general recommendations for in a and the on

am asking from a i can imagine a scenario with two required private keys needed for decryption scenarios that may make this an attractive this is to settle an my vote is that it is not adding any additional security other than having to compromise two different private i think that if it was any more secure than encrypting it one million times would be the best way to secure informaiton and i buy so i guess my question becomes is a two locking mechanism equivalent to another one locking mechanism with a single forgive me if the answer is obvious but my bread goes dead as i read books on the there any benefit to encrypting twice using	
am attempting to create a reusable navigation style in like a navigation bar on a it will contain links to all the main pages in my this control can go on top of all my pages in my giving a nice consistent look and feel across like a issue is in styling the current link differently than the other so that you can quickly glance at it and see which page since the control is the same on each i need to tell it which page is and have it style that link first thought was to simply place properties on the one for each and then set the appropriate property to true on the i could use one property that accepts an enum value instead of having many either in the control template for my header custom i can create a datatrigger that watches this relativesource all that my this but going to have to duplicate that and all the setters in for every single page i because the trigger has to directly reference the property which only applies to the one so i need a different style for every even though the actual style its describing is exactly the same which i the setters are the the only difference is what property the trigger is there some way to do this something with the same end without ending up with hundreds of lines of duplicated style active

am building a web site with and most of the site structure is static enough to create a folder structure and aspx the site administrators want the ability to add new pages to different sections of the site through a web interface and using a wysiwyg i am using nested master pages to give the different sections of the site their own what i would like to do is have a generic page under each section of the site that uses the appropriate master page and has a place holder for content that could be loaded from a i would also like these pages to have a url like any other aspx as if they had corresponding files on the so rather than have my url would be something problem is that does not because the administrator created it through the web and the content is stored in the what thinking is that implement an http handler that handles requests for aspx in that check to see if the url that was requested is an actual file or one of my if it is a request for a fake the request to the generic content page for the appropriate change the query string to request the appropriate data from the and rewrite the url so that it looks to the user as if the fake page really the problem having right now is that i figure out how to route the request to the default handler for aspx i tried to instantiate a but the constuctor is protected is there any way for me to tell my httphandler to call the httphandler that would normal be used to process a my handler code currently looks like public class fakepagehandler public bool get return public void reroute the request to the generic page and rewrite the pagehandlerfactory factory new this compile because the constructor is protected route the request to the default handler for aspx pagehandlerfactory factory new public string public string public string still have some work to do to determine if the request is for a real and i rewritten any urls but is something like this is there another way to create a pagehandlerfactory other than calling its is there any way i can route the request up to the httphandler for an aspx basically be saying this aspx request as you normally i use httphandler to fake the existence of aspx

am by know means a hosting guru and i imagine there are ways and means of doing this but my personal opinion is that what you are talking about doing is defiantly an unnecessary security if this site is to be available on the internet it will have public access then you probably want to disable anonymous access in remember that the idea of being able to configure the anonymous access for a site in iis is so that you can create a user which has specific permission to read the relevant files for a particular what we are talking about here is file access on a physical for one thing a public web server should be in a dmz and not part of your companies domain so users should not be able to log in with their domain credentials only reason why i could imagine that you would want to switch off anonymous access and force users to input their windows credentials is for a site which will only be used internally and even then i would probably not choose to restrict access in this you want to restrict access to content on a public website then you would probably be better of writing something which handles authentication as part of the site itself or a service which the site can then if someone were to obtain user credentials then at least all they will be able to do is gain access to the site and there is no potential for a breach of your internal network by any is a reason why developers spend allot of time writing user management you will find plenty of advice on how to write something like this and plenty of libraries that will do most of the work for

am surprised that so few are mentioning encapsulation here in an instance method will automatically have access to all private properties and in addition to all protected ones inherited from base you write code you should write it so that you expose as little as possible and also so that you have access to as little as it might be important to make your code fast which would happen if making your methods but usually more important then that is to make your code as incapable of creating bugs as possible one way to achieve that is to have your code have access to as little as possible of might seem irrelevant at first glance since the op is obviously talking about refactoring which can not go wrong in this scenario and create any new however this refactored code must be maintained in the future and modified which makes your code have a bigger in regards to new bugs if it has access to private instance so in general i think the conclusion here is that mostly your methods should be unless there are any other reasons for not having them and this simply because use of encapsulation and data hiding and creates

am trying to create an app in with and want the any active windows to change opacity on a mouseover i understand there is no explicit mouseover event in i got rudimentary functioning by reimplementing in the class that declares my but the mousemoveevent is not called whenever the mouse travels over any of the group boxes i have created in there since qgroupbox has its own reimplementation of as a cheap work i am still using the mousemoveevent of my mainwindow but a query the global mouse position and based on the position of the mainwindow through and the window size size rheight and i check if the mouse is within the bounds of the area of the mainwindow and change the opacity has had very limited the right border works the the left changes opacity 4 pixels the top does not work because the mouse goes through the menubar and title and the bottom changes way too thought of creating an empty container qwidget class and then place all the rest in but i felt that it would still not solve the big issue of the base widget not receiving the mousemoveevent if it has already been implemented in a child suggest any i have made in my method or any alternate methods to achieve i doubt this but i am working qt creator not qt integration into vs2008 the same classes anyways different compiler over transparency in

am trying to decide between two possible implementations and am eager to choose the best one need to add an optional blob field to a table which currently only has 3 simple it is predicted that the new field will be used in fewer than maybe even less than of cases so it will be null for most rows in fact most of our customers will probably never have any blob data in first inclination was to add a new table to hold just the with a foreign key in the first he predicts this will have performance benefits when querying the first thoughts were that it is more logical and easier to store the blob directly in the original none of our queries do from that table so my intuition is that storing it directly have a significant performance going to benchmark both choices but i was hoping some sql gurus had any advice from mssql and overhead of adding a blob field to a

am working on a exe to export sql to we do not want to use dts as we have multiple clients each exporting different views and the overhead to setup and maintain the dts packages is too this process is automated for many clients every so the whole process has to be kicked off and controlled within a cursor in a stored this is because the data has to be filtered per project for the have tried many ways to get data out of sql into access and the most promising has been using access interop and running a have hit a problem where i am importing from and running the import manually it seems the view does not start returning data fast so access pops up a messagebox dialog to say it has timed think this is happening in interop as but because it is hidden the method never there any way for me to prevent this message from popping or increasing the timeout of the import current plan of attack is to flatten the view into a then import from that then drop the flattened for any suggestions how to tackle this info on what i am have multiple clients which each have a standard data one of the is a access exporter it reads the views to export from a parameter table then the views are filtered by and a access file is created for each project view has project are running sql 2005 and are not moving to sql 2005 we will probably jump to 2008 in quite a few then have a module execution job which executes the configured module on each there are many jobs that run in this module and the access exporter must be able to fit into this so i need a generic sql access exporter which can be configured through our parameter the sproc calls a exe i have written and my exe opens access via i know this is bad for a server but the module execution is written so only a single module is executing at a so the procedure will never be running more than one instance at a access interop data

an alternative to andrew use for compilations and for compilations on ppc or sparc or intel machines since you actually mention which chip architecture you are using and that notation works on all of often ensure a compilation more to ensure cc an environment variable used by though in this it is also recognized by which is a shell script generated by the notation i used which is what i use at the command line sets cc in the environment while the command is the other answer suggests assume that works and achieves much the same not tried it so i know that it you run you will see information just standard about how to use the and at the it will list of relevant environment of which cc is advantage of setting the c compiler to is that the flag is set every time the compiler is used there is very little room for it to go if you set a flags variable there is a chance that some command use and then things can go going back to the certainly uses a variable called and you can set that on the make command overrides any setting in the by using an environment the setting in the makefile overrides the value in the so setting cc as an environment variable is less although gives the environment precedence over the it is usually a dangerous option to use it can have unexpected	
an alternative was faced with the exact same problem at work i wasted a good week in trying to figure the best way to do i ended up with creating a join as you have but the table contains only instead of keeping track of status quo is has read all their the unread messages their should be as fast as status quo should be the least straining status on the if i kept track of all the messages everyone has the clutter in the database grows pretty rapidly easily leading to thousands of rows of in even smaller this problem is exaggerated if the lifetime of messages are indefinite you could be keeping track of message statuses that are many years keeping track of the your table contains only a handful of and they diminish for each message that a user getting the amount of unread messages is as simple as from unread where user this is a while reading is pretty much as fast as computationally writing is a for each written you need to insert an entry to this join if multiple people can read the same you need to insert one row for each if the recipients are implicit only a user name is or even with the criteria such as who has access to this creating new messages becomes even more i feel this is a fair

an exception there will be time overhead which depends on how you implement your exception being the severity of an event that should cause an exception will take just as much time to handle using any other why not use the highly supported language based method of dealing with such gnu compiler uses the model by default there is no time overhead when exceptions information about code and the offsets of local objects can be computed once at compile such information can be kept in a single place associated with each but not in each you essentially remove exception overhead from each ari and thus avoid the extra time to push them onto the this approach is called the model of exception and the optimized storage mentioned earlier is known as the shadow bruce thinking in volume size complexity overhead easily quantifiable but eckel states an average of 5 and 15 this will depend on the size of your exception handling code in ratio to the size of your application if your program is small then exceptions will be a large part of the if you are using a model than exceptions will take more space to remove the time so if you care about space and not time than use is that most embedded systems have plenty of memory to the extent that if your system has a compiler you have enough space to include the computer that my project uses has several gb of secondary 512 mb of main hence no space problem for exceptions our micorcontrollers are programmed in my heuristic is there is a mainstream compiler for use otherwise use

an experienced c programmer dipping my toes in oo design i have a particular piece of code i hate and would like to clean up using code implements a display tree for use in a 3d graphics it is a linked list of entries which have a type field specifying whether the entry is a geometry feature or light in particular geometry features can either be a single piece of geometry of a collection of sub which is indicated by the presence of a separate a linked list it is a flat structure but the order implies each entry has an attribute structure which is able to be propagated down the separate function allows this list to be traversed and a provided function pointer to be executed on traversal of the each function used in this way must take proper care to maintain the attribute structure as it is propagated down the list and this is a frequent cause of rendering bugs things not realising they should be redrawn because they are part of a group of for some aspects of oo design jump right out at me i am interested to i would best implement being able to pass a function pointer down a list vector are stl vectors ok for lists like i would be right to implement windows and geometry features as related even the classes to best design a class that can have a collection of suggestions regarding attribute transferral between objects the desired behaviour is that modifying a feature will alter the attributes of that feature and any it and modifying a will only modify that realize this is a long and broad so appreciate your thoughts on any of the above design propagating

and but i must disagree with you in the strongest way possible in regard to not using pt sizes and always using designer wanting a font size to be to the default size specified in browser or os which should be the should use or a designer wanting an size should use to keep the font size constant regardless of the dpi and laptops and mobile screens have much denser pixels than up to approximately 150dpi of natural resolution compared to the medical and other specialized screens go even and the user has the ability not always the to raise or lower the logical dpi to customize the display according to his preferences and sight image or text sized in pixels will be too small to read on a making your users struggle and rendering any users with less than perfect sight unable to read the more importantly one can argue if this is correct behavior or some browsers do not resize text even when the user commands making the situation paper where position to the precision of 100ths of an inch is possible and everyone reading a work sees the the diversity of devices used to access the net invalidates the entire concept of which looks good only on the one device it was targeted the point of the design on the web is to make the site accessible to the target which usually should be as large as possible and would be using a range of devices and systems are already going there with vector ui elements at the large source bitmaps that are scaled so should forgetting about the arbitrary unit of measure called and making your designs compatible with the widest array of access devices to additional raised by the situation with dpi awareness thus with proper support for in currently popular operating systems for the lack of a stronger printable a as summarized by the most computers know so the browsers in the absence of this operating systems and browsers typically just make and these assumptions are usually while in theory points would be the best unit for fixed in practice using them today produces inconsistent results in many thus designers often have to give up and revert to pixels to achieve fixed font i use percentages and avoiding fixed sizes archives have a great of the font sizing and numerous links to details and various

and i are having an argument over the value and usage of tags in looking to the stackoverflow community to put in their thoughts to help us resolve the side claims that tags are a valuable addition to release an example of their we do a maven which makes a new tag it which is code snapshot used for this this tag should be a readonly when a bug needs to be fixed we can make a copy of the tag into a new branch it bug fixes go these fixes may be merged back into trunk so that the main dev branch gets the bug is released and a tag is automatically this cycle the main benefit here of the tag is that if you ever need to version for any you can just release the tag with the confidence that never been altered by saying tag is cleaner than saying revision 1 of branch which is the original without the other side claims that tags providing any valuable especially in a system like subversion with global which act like a tag in subversion only gives a warning when committing to a it actually stop their method is developing in trunk and upon release make a branch called continue bug fixes in trunk and if you needed to those bug fixes to merge them into branch and at some perhaps after major fixes or features in release and make branch cycle if you ever need to release the original have to check out branch revision both methods like to hear the thoughts on which method is preferred and a little worried that the way depends on the underlying scm either settle on subversion for answers or if possible keep it scm usage of tags in

and serialization are synonymous in the context of remote procedure but semantically different as a matter of marshaling is about getting parameters from here to while serialization is about copying structured data to or from a primitive form such as a byte in this serialization is one means to perform usually implementing is also possible for an object to be marshaled by in which case the data the is simply location information for the original such an object may still be amenable to value there may be additional metadata such as code base location or even object implementation	
and should fix the others will tell you to do things like edit the generated but not a good practice the changes will go away as soon as the web reference is seeing is by see how web services when you use web visual studio downloads the wsdl file from the and uses the xml schemas from the wsdl to create some proxy classes to represent the xml described by the it also creates a proxy class for the service having methods for each operation in the proxy data classes can serialize to the xml that the service is expecting to and can be deserialized back from the xml that the server sends in way to think of it is that you only have this problem because both client and service are if your client were written in then you be thinking of sharing that wcf can do if it introduces a dependency between the client and service both have to use compatible versions of the assembly containing the but when you need to do the option is useful when there is behavior in these classes that must be used both by the client and by the	
and ssl are similar protocols that both use most of the same cryptographic primitives under the so they are both as secure as each one advantage of ssh is that using authentication is actually quite easy to and built right into the ssl a bit of a mess involving ca certificates and other after you have the pki in place you also need to configure your services to use the pki for authentication instead of its internal password this is a nightmare on some services and a piece of cake on it also means you need to go to the hassle of signing all of your keys so they can log in with competent users can grok ssh keys in no time but it takes a bit longer to get their heads around ssl keys extra ca certs and key certs confused me when i first discovered is great for unix but ftp over ssl is probably easier to do if your users are and are pretty clueless about anything other than internet exploiter you mind risking that your users will choose insecure	
and support is handled at the database so being quite database the use of a database function in the constraint supported in django all dbs may support or support it etc you have a few code maintaining database portability is override the method in your model class and perform checking there in this is obviously a performance drain as you will have to issue a query before you issue an but as with all things performance it may be best to try the simplest solution first and then see if truly a performance issue for your application and deployment is effectively what the project that adam bernier pointed out in the question comments is just with a level of abstraction you probably sql if you care so much about database or are happy to write the appropriate sql for all the databases you need to you can take advantage of hook for running custom sql statements after the is run for the the django docs cover it initial sql the example in the as the title is for populating initial data using you can put any set of sql statements in the including commands to introduce a constraint with a function right after the table is django lets you provide separate sql statements for each database type you

answer is long answer is that the bathtub distribution a very good because of the lack of continuity in the way failures say for example that an input value of 42 causes a then the distribution of those failures will be exactly the distribution of 42 values in the not like as you software fail over it fails when it may be that misusing the words you my mean a rather than a a is one occurrence of incorrect a is a flaw in the a appearance of defects in software tends to have a but it really anywhere near as clean as your bugs tend to be observed early and taper then spike on patches and new with a general upward trend starting farther into the life of the even that takes careful as you really are talking about defects observed per unit having said modern se practices tend to change the actual rates but not the distribution of observed defects over here is worth a little definition the space shuttle hal software have very low defect using se techniques that were 20 years strong structured rigorous review and ocd version control and extreme programming tends to have low but many of the things more traditional methods would call xp calls since no finite and rigorous definition of what it a is just another have been decent studies to show that do result in low defect but be very surprised if the time distribution is a different

answer once accepted here is incorrect has since been so it does not correctly eliminate all trivially it may appear to work but it can especially in the case that 0 and 1 are considered valid for the following at and are perpendicular lines which clearly do not dot dot to the above these two line segments meet at an endpoint of 0 and that endpoint would apparently the two line segments meet at which is on line but not on line so what is going the answer is that the values of 0 and 1 are not valid and only sometimes happen to correctly predict endpoint when the extension of one line not the would meet the line the algorithm predicts an intersection of line but this is not i imagine that by testing starting with ab vs cd and then also testing with cd vs this problem would be only if both fall between 0 and 1 inclusively can they be said to recommend using the vector cross product method if you must predict

answer this in terms of but other programming environments can be add that this solution is valid to solve the problem in any number of dimensions that we have two line segments in pq and here are a few random sets of p q r s infinite line is easily defined p we r that for each when the parameter is at 0 or we get one of the original endpoints on the line we know that and way of defining a line parametrically is very useful in many imagine we were looking down along line can we find the point of smallest distance from the line segment rs to the infinite line this is most easily done by a projection into the null space of line n is a pair of basis vectors that span the two dimensional subspace orthogonal to the line r s what we have done is to project the vector rs into the 2 dimensional subspace orthogonal to the line by subtracting off p point on line to get r and we ensure that the infinite line passes through the origin in this projection we have reduced this to finding the minimum distance from the line to the origin in the projection recall that the line is defined by the parameter v r normal vector to the line will give us what we since we have reduced this to 2 dimensions because the original space was we can do it just have used null this little trick works in n n is now a vector with unit the distance from the infinite line to the origin is d that i could also have used to get the same the actual distance is but as it turns d was positive here d we determine v from recall that the origin is a distance of d units from the line that connects points r and therefore we can write r for some value of the scalar form the dot product of each side of this equation with the vector and solve for v tells us that the closest approach of the line segment rs to the origin happened outside the end points of the line so really the closest point on rs to the origin was the point out from the this tells us that the closest point on line segment rs to the infinite line pq was the point is one more step in the analysis to what is the closest point on the line segment does this point fall inside the line or does it too fall outside the project the point s onto the line expression for u is easily enough derived from similar logic as i did note here that used to do the u that u lies in the interval we have solved the the point on line pq p the distance between closest points on the two line segments all of this can be compressed into just a few short lines of but it helps to expand it all out to gain understanding of how it

answer was very but i was surprised to see that it end with you should ask yourself why you are populating a combo box with duplicate the framework bug no doubt has been allowed to exist because when you use the control as to allow the user to pick an item from a you run into this is the user going to differentiate between the identical why would they choose one over is there a different meaning to the different if then having duplicate entries is which is always bad usability if then you have duplicate only scenario i can think of where this might make sense is when you have a large list consisting of several groups of related where one or more items logically fits into more than one group so you want to display it in both guessing your design account for the fact that there may be multiple identical entries and that this omission will have other usability repercussions that are more significant than this of i understand that you may be doing something i thought of where it totally makes sense to do what in which case you can feel free to ignore my	
answer your actual you will get an ienumerator that is bound to the state of the list as it was when you asked for further operations operate on the using a for you are making a sequence if calls to get a particular item by there an outside context such as the enumerator that knows that in a for all the collection only asking for one since the collection never handed out an no way for it to know that the reason asking for item then item then item etc is because walking the mucking with the list at the same time as walking going to get errors either if adding then the for loop may skip some while the foreach loop will if removing then the for loop may throw an index out of range if but will probably work most of the i think you understand all your question was simply why two ways of iterating behaved the answer to that is the state of the collection is the when you call getenumerator in one and when you call in the other

answers that talk about using arp to find the dns server are generally ip address resolution for ip addresses is done using and not the responsibility to answer such an arp routing is done by the machine knowing which ip addresses are on the local subnets to which it is if the requested ip address is not then the client machine refers to its routing table to find out which gateway to send the packet in most circumstances the packet sent out will be an arp request to find the mac address of the default if not already in the arp then can it send the dns query via the in this case the packet is sent with the dns ip address in the ip destination but with the mac address on the ethernet

anyone used the i am using it right it but it is typically quite a bit of coding for the graphical i currently am struggling to leverage the ibm uml etc built on top of good or bad experiences you made using looking back on my initial dives into etc i can say for study the there are important patterns that you have to on from the examples and not the i would also suggest a new book modeling a language specific for gmf modeling in i paged through it and it seemed to be the missing manual to some of the more basic why the book is good is that is focuses on the key to making useful through constraining it to a specific domain and providing a tool that only allows for valid models to be there is not a lot of documentation online and the api only tells you so watch out for loops caused by calling or other set methods on it crashes the eclipse not oh yes and the apis are split between eclipse help documentation versions or included at alternatives for graphical modeling you could uml profiles with custom images and icons rather than full shape it takes about 2 hours to put together a pretty good editor building on top of uml graphical objects and uml the ibm rsm tool uml profile tooling project does this there is a lot you can do with constrained uml profiles eclipse or entering gmf land is more than a order of magnitude effort from 1 to 10 hours no pure dsl specific tools out google will provide a good from what i have seen the main reason to use gmf is eclipse integration and leveraging existing this is why i use yourself do i need model which is or do i need a tool for creating instances of this if there are only expert users there may not be a need for a sleek	
api gives you the option to have the feeds in xml or json check their i know much about the iphone but it surely has xml see apple including a inbuilt api to the sdk for two they start at have to do friendfeed are many twitter apps on the app store if apple released a twitter have much more competition and be happy with	
api has some target audience clients developing integrations to your from this point of view it would be the best to get the feedback from members of this you can establish some early access or ship some public you have no such audience you are developing api for a which is not yet i would suggest to do some king of pick a developer of approximately target audience skill and give him some assignment involving the api then get a feedback from	
api is what you need to look this will explain to you how views are managed by portlet how portlets are rendered and how actions are interaction is always action and render while web server interaction is always single a standard web the form is submitted to the servlet specified in action field of the html form in the action url for an html form is generated using the actionurl portlet tag the html form results in invoking the actionresponse method of a are allowed to do and portlets are only allowed to can render a complete portlets render only page so	
apis like threading building blocks openmp sdl or sfml and i think also opengl implement a timer or a wrapper around a using library is a bit which library do you mean in the you have to use some library or inline because have timing functionality in the core and without any timer processor or some other timing hardware in whichever form there is no way to tell the not not that includes internet time	
apologize for the half but to see if this actually possible will take quite a bit of you look at the xml fairly particularly the hash which if you then the ide will delete the tried that actually automate it you would need to use the vs automation the apis are pretty and also i find a specific class or anything dealing with class diagrams in look through the important enough for you to spend a couple hours you would start by creating one manually so that you can inspect it with the automation the envdte com cocreated or supplied in a vs use to open your then use to find your project with the class and to find the class diagram i would first look to see if the kind property on the projectitem indicated something and then fiddle with other properties and reflect over the object property of the projectitem to see if you get something you just need to generate it then take a look at the property to get a list of available the command invoked by right clicking on the menu should be in there then you could use as uiheirarchy to get the solution explorer window and fiddle with uiheirarchy and uiheirarchyitem to select the files and then invoke the i provide a full but since i have the tree walking code it would take a couple

approach dynamic is basically each substring of the original figure out all possible values it can in your first example can become either or may be a lot of different but many of them will be you should ignore all combinations that are greater than the when you add a or a you can envision it as combining two substrings of the since you have the possible values for each you can see if such a combination is values can be generated try splitting the substring in all possible and combine the different values in each half of the total number of is something like target for your example than the but if you had a string of length 1000 and a target of say then the problem would be solvable with dynamic	
approach is definitely and it makes it easy to change if you want to modify the way the html is displayed at a later time i would say ascx is a good	
approach is to adopt a push model rather than a pull typically you need different formatters because breaking and have something truckxmlformatter implements vehiclexmlformatter public void format vehicle truck truck pulling data from the specific type into the create a data sink and invert the flow so the specific type pushes data to the sink truck implements vehicle public datasink inspect datasink out if begin returns boolean to let the sink ignore this allowing for cyclic return means still got the data and just feeding tagged data to the an xml sink might then ignore certain parts of the maybe reorder some of and write the it could even delegate to different sink strategy but the sink necessarily need to care about the type of the only how to represent the data in some using interned global ids rather than inline strings helps keep the computation cost down matters if writing or other tight

approach would be to wrap the code object in another something like def return whenever you need the code object you use and whenever you need the you use there may be a way to get eval to treat the new class as though it were an ordinary code redirecting the function to call advantage of this is the original string is deleted at the same time as the code however you do i think storing the original string is probably the best as you end up with the exact string you not just an	
approach would be to write a third proxy application which services the and performs two internal requests to the other two returning whichever result is with a regular module written in you could also install a which could intercept make a subrequest to the first app before letting execution continue into the second a rough example of how put that package use use use use use sub handler my a user agent to make the my a request on the app1 domain with the same my my the outcome of the if if you apache ok to falling through to app return your app2 vhost can use the handler by doing something like this in its perlaccesshandler

are a and you should avoid them being if if you are implemented you will almost always want to write one conjunction with a that calls and you implement a then unless any idisposable instances that you are holding implement finalizers you will say for example that safehandle have a finalizer but relied on someone calling if you held and implement a then allowing your consumer to permanently leak the handle by not calling dispose on that both your consumer and objects that you consume will play nice a reason not to play nice even if you use a you should dispose of it as if it were managed otherwise if you dispose of it at all then it will have to wait until gc to be and if you do dispose of it in dispose but no a and no one disposes of then it will have to wait until the gc after the one that collected above has the right not and by adding you avoid the gc except in cases where no on disposed of you for adding a boolean to track if been disposed of i prefer to just write my dispose methods to be for also helps to do it that way when an object may acquire resources during use and you only want to dispose the ones it

are a number of things that make reverse engineering il fairly this is in x86 you have to infer the types of variables based on how they are information on the structure of the application is more available in il combined with type gives you an amazing amount of working at a pretty high level at this point to x86 in native you have to infer the structure layouts even the fact that they are based on how the data is not but much more time knowing the names of things can be means you have quite a lot of data about the il is basically working at a level much closer to the source than a compiler of native code would the higher level the bytecode works the easier reverse engineering generally	
are a number of ways you can do in your main thread to wait in a blocking fashion for each thread to in a polling fashion generally discouraged to wait until each thread has for each thread in call to call a method in your and program each thread to throw an uncaught exception when it locks or synchronizers or mechanisms from create a listener in your main and then program each of your threads to tell the listener that they have to implement idea one way is to first create an interface threadcompletelistener void thread create the following abstract class notifyingthread extends thread private final new public final void threadcompletelistener public final void threadcompletelistener private final void for listener public final void try finally public abstract void then each of your threads will extend and instead of implementing it will implement thus when they they will automatically notify anyone waiting for in your main class the one that starts all the threads at least the object waiting for modify that class to and immediately after creating each thread add itself to the list of thread1 new add ourselves as a start the as each thread your method will be invoked with the thread instance that just completed that better would be to rather than for as extending thread is usually discouraged in new but coding to your if you change the class to implement then you have to change some of your code that manages which is pretty straightforward to

are moving out of vb6 as quickly as we but in the meantime begun building our vb6 applications from the command line on a build the build server has a basic video adapter and causes the forms to be truncated down to the resolution of the basic adapter rather than the height and width in the form workaround that discovered requires going into each load event and manually setting the height and width properties to the observed sizes in the form properties are many dozens of forms involved in this application and more applications with more dozens of forms to i want to build a script to handle where in the do i find the height and width of the form as shown in the properties a search of the file turn up any neither does opeing the file and converting a known height or width to hex is there something else i can do besides edit each and every in form ignored with command line	
are much better off if the is in a fixed length column so that the table has fixed length mysql with myisam will operate quite efficiently for you allocate as much memory as you can for the key buffer so that much of the index in your goal should be a single random access to the disk to retrieve one row you do better than that given 100gb of data and 8gb of you should not expect to achieve more than a few hundred such queries per because all the random accesses a disk can might be interested in my mysql custom storage engine it manages memory differently from although the profile of your application exactly what my engine was optimized	
are mulitple issues with this none of which tell me why your role name is not being what value is in my guess is for some of the you be using session to pass down information to your business you have method so use currently you just ignore have a nice little sql injection you are taking untrusted user data and placing it directly into you sql this is rewrite this using close your sql connection if you find the you just use a using statment to wrap your connenction object so that the connection is closed call getlogin with username and although the method parameters are username and but thats becuase you ignore them you should be using the user name and password to look up the you should be hashing the password and comparing against a stored hashed your getlogin should return some user class or at the least the role are ignoring the return value from getuser so even if you find the user you say you to answer your i know why your role name is set to most likely that is what is stored in the however you really need to fix these other

are rsa is not a block so you cannot really talk about the block size of output of a rsa encryption will have the same length as the rsa you have not indicated any rsa key in your so the runtime will far as i use a default that key apparently has a 1024 bit which explains the output might want to look into aes encryption for many reasons you should normally only use rsa to encrypt a key and then use aes or a similar symmetric cipher algorithm to encrypt your actual is a block cipher with block size 16 so that will on which padding you use and how you transport your initialization encrypt 16 bytes of plain data to 16 bytes of encrypted

are smart to be thinking of designing a data layer in your in an application this will help you standardize and pretty dramatically simplify your data you need to learn how to create and use objectdatasources but this is quite other advantage of a data access layer using a separate is that it makes unit testing much also encourage you to build a business layer to do much of the processing of data business for would be responsible for pulling objectdatasources from the dal to hand to the ui not only does this let you encapsulate your business it improves the testability of the code as do want to be caching datasets dal for that in the you will build a web app so that record modifications work through a unique id other primary key and feed changes directly to the dal as they are if you were to cache everything you would reduce the scalability of your others on this thread are promoting the idea of using i would be careful about adopting a orm for reasons that i have previously outlined and i that it would be wise to avoid in my own i make extensive use of datareaders to fill my objectdatasources is trivial due to the design of my and find it to be very

asked a yesterday about comparing ranges for overlap and its been stuck in my throat ever consensus seems to be that my preferred answer which involves using the array intersection operator is inefficient because comparing arrays is wonder why this feature is in the could it be that the language creators believed that sometimes you need an elegant way to achieve a solution even if expensive to do is comparing arrays so costly that you should avoid it whenever the whole attraction of ruby for me is the focus on syntactic elegance over premature if the array intersection operator is why is it	
asked this question previously but the answers what i was looking created a table in without using it contains two and is a many to many what i can be multiple records with your name as the there can also be multiple records with frienduserid being the there cannot be multiple records with both being the for not right clicked on the table and chose i then put both columns in the columns section and chose to make the i thought this would make them unique as a whole but individually not you go to the it show keys next to both columns and says that there is a constraint with both columns being there a way of just making sure that you are not inserting a duplicate copy of a record into the table without individual columns being tried controling it with my sql insert statement but that did not this is what i into values where not exist from work for some you for your record in

attempting to compile a working copy of the class library using the sources from the imagemagick and magicknet was unable to obtain a copy of the magicknet source files from the homepage as it is currently so i was forced to obtain the files and project file from courtesy of a google the instructions stated and i created a project using the option and compiled before moving to the magicknet project file and compiling that as after making sure all the paths pointed to the right i keep receiving this error upon error already defined in also receive 371 other all of them related to an external symbol and a final 372nd error describing that i have unresolved managed to solve the dllmain error above by commenting out the dllmain declaration from the source file from the project in the imagemagick however the 372 other errors still had performed a search for people with similar and have said that the author had offered a download of a magicknet dll which works however i mentioned his homepage appears to be inaccessible currently seeking one of these solution to my compilation as i may be making a mistake on my part since not familiar with at link to another magicknet source zip that is confirmed to compile correctly with the latest version of link to a working precompiled copy of the magicknet if anyone kept a copy from the it should be approximately 3mb as it contains the imagemagick libraries as would really appreciate any one of these as i desperately require ability to manipulate and convert as well as ease of i can provide additional details if you need more i am using visual studio 2008 to compile the source and the supplied projects convert with no issues at source compilation

be you blame it all on ie microsoft certainly is by far the worst part of the problem with such large standards is that too much of a moving target to be perfectly implemented in a timely the release cycles of web browsers do not coincide with the release of new web so all browser developers can do is try to implement as many features as they can from the latest w3c selecting what will be the most commonly used features to implement things are clearly and it possible to support and still use proper css take a look at comparison of layout engines css if you look at the overall see that most browsers do tend to comply with established standards in the it just takes some browsers longer than others to implement a standard after its sometimes not that one browser is than with new standards the problem is often that different development teams chose to adopt of the new so even though css3 is already beginning to be implemented by most probably have to wait until css4 is published before seeing consistent support across all major rendering and if you try to use the latest css3 features right have a hard time establishing compatibility across all major but if using features introduced in no problem at the only from using ugly css to stick with then the problem is no longer to conform to web standards while supporting a particular instead the problem simply becomes to resist the urge to use the latest greatest css from the only permanent solution i see to this recurring situation is for the w3c to different parts of newly introduced specifications so that the new features can be implemented in discrete phases synchronized across all the major for grammar rules might be given the highest priority along with a set deadline for its after that would come the second which could be element attribute and so on and so would require a tremendous level of cooperation between the w3c and development but it would be worth after it does users and web developers no good for ie to implement one subset of features from css3 while firefox implements a different subset and the webkit browsers yet another a is no good until actually across all the major rendering better for each browser to support fewer new features but have them all be same than for them to separately introduce a ton of their own features that universally

been asking how to produce an estimate and an uncertainty a better way to think of this is to do a estimate and a combine the two to have an estimate well understood issues will naturally be more specific then the estimates for for an estimate that looks like days is probably for a well understood an estimate that looks like days would be typical for an issue not at all limit the amount of investigation and time spent producing an estimate by allowing for a wider gap between the this works because its relatively easy to imagine realistic best case and worst case when the uncertainty range is more than comfortable dealing with in the then take some time to understood the less understood it may help to break them usually go for granularity rather than hour granularity in my estimates if the work is expected to take more than a week	
been battling rcp integration for some the key is not so much getting your setup you can get it to work eventually by build process in my the hard part is keeping everything up to every time eclipse revs their find yourself a bunch of pom files for that newest rcp widget or swt ci helps with this the problem is that eclipse and maven are very particular about the way they do the business of and their approaches are quite to make matters pde dev eclipse more is powered by a lot of wizard which is sometimes quite opaque as to happening behind the question you really need to ask yourself is if worth the in my particular i believe it has is too good to live but the is that you may find yourself being the which can take valuable time away from actual which is probably what you enjoy

been doing web development for a while and fairly competent in lately learnt java and fallen in love with and really like to do more java work gotten my first opportunity with a client who needs a web web app and he has agreed to let me use anything i want including i done any web in java only went through the java learnt a bit about applets and build a 2d pacman and have done some simple work in web need to get started with this project in the next days so i have much time to read long books about the this is what learnt so a tomcat on my dev machine to work with the basics of the and a mini mvc app which displays a html lets you pick something from a dropdown and when you hit it retrieves your submitted value through in the and then forwards on to a jsp page which shows which value you think these are the next few things need to to and more about the syntax of jsp seem to be hundreds of topics about java web dev which i know anything but i have time to learn i need someone to point out any other crucial things need to in order to build this web app perhaps 20 using java and google web coming from a background which is an mvc framework in php that makes things like form sessions management uses database and common tasks like these very if there is a lightweight framework in java that can take care of things like please mention it as do i need to learn to build a web app in	
been following mvc pretty much from the and i have to i love combined with unity another di it just flows always liked a certain separation of concerns principle and favored over php classic i always like the control pattern of mvc fits much and with and for return types interacting with and is very simplified on the it also works well when following solid design does help to have a solid understanding of html and javascript for more interactive it also helps to think in terms of the mvc or not thinking about cluttering your controller and your thing i care as much is the lack of a built in skinning for multiple skins on a come around and having the source really i would say as other have follow the blogs read of and they all have vital beyond as also the demos on the mvc are very

been playing around with the code contracts some more myself on a small but moderately complex standalone which needs to inherit from some bcl classes and use other contracts thing seems great when working in a completely isolated environment with just your own code and primitive but as soon as you start using bcl classes until do not have their own the verifier cannot check whether they will violate any of the and so you get a lot of warnings about potentially unsatisfied the other it does find some invalid or potentially unsatisfied constraints which could be real but very hard to find these because there is so much noise that hard to find out which ones you can possible to suppress the warnings from the bcl classes by using the assume but this is somewhat as these classes will have contracts in the future and assumptions will lessen their my feeling is that for because in trying to build on a framework that the verifier does not sufficiently that probably worth waiting for

been using facelets for a little over a one of the main advantages i see in java web frameworks is that it helps to keep the code clean and promotes for in you get any scriptlets in your pages like you do in seen asp files in production that are over 3000 lines nothing inherently wrong with asp or but it does make it quite easy to lump some business logic in the no until someone else has to maintain frameworks try to you keep a more strict separation of mvc or whatever model they which in turn leads to cleaner templates whatever and business and domain code that is automatically unit using many of the frameworks can take a bit more time up but save you many times that when it comes to maintenance and	
been using for two and a half years is what i production of software version into several transition call them whatever you features for the very first for others plan enhancement and should be as granular as possible provided each ticket has a deliverable time on ticket creation is not a good more granular and smaller tasks more control over the earlier discovery of planning shortcomings and more time to manage can split even when in if developer reached the result that can be shown to the customer but did not complete the whole then developer can split the task and mark the completed part as or which gives some more granular the progress not weekly at least several times a trac is a very nice the best feature or trac is ability to put wikilinks including changeset if you demand putting ticket in changeset comment and then putting changeset number to the ticket comment this links the tasks and changes to the later these links make it easier to track the evolution of the it is a life saver especially if the project goes beyond a couple of month in

been working in tool support for traceability in software engineering on and off for the last fifteen and the best widely available is they all require manual connection to be made you can add ids to your code and unit and get some coverage metrics quite easy to make a simple tool which associates a specific test with a requirement and then reports that requirement as similarly you can add markers to say what parts of your code map to your design elements that has mostly been automated by reverse engineering then you can tell whether you have markers for all your requirements and all your design these are extensions to cots uml so probably not designed in quite the same spirit as no tool aware of currently gives you is any means to actually determining whether the tests exercise the parts of the design which are supposed to implement the hyperlinked requirement is as you can log the coverage in the code which is linked to the design elements when the test is are other such as cadiz and cog which are theorem proving tools which can take a formal description of your requirements and annotated model of your code and verify that the model matches the this works for sufficiently simple but is fairly time consuming the order of weeks for a few dozen lines of for level computer of the tools i know of integrate with

believe that there is a one place inwhich this information can be you can find out the last time a user logged on and what dc authenticated from but the problem is that when you login the first dc to respond is the server which authenticates that dc then logs this info to its which resides on each host and not in a central you can see more about this from these to so that being said i guess you could get the last login from the lastlogontimestamp ad property from the user account and then query the eventlog from all of the in the domain to find out which dc it was that authenticated them and from what but all of this will only tell the last lgged on all of teh systems that they could be logged again you could compare these results to the logoff times which can be pulled from the dc really this seems to be a major overkill and that you would have better luck writing a script which had these events logged to a central reporting system which you could use for future is another you can query your wins server to poll the logon information that it has for a which should return back the system inwhich it believes they logged see this post for how to do the command wins server show name username you are using some sort of management software such as desktop then you may have more luck exploring where the desktop agents log this information because they usually log this information also into some sql

best approach to migrating to a usable willing to break every application that currently uses the your options are because you change the existing structure very you think carefully about your motivations if you have an existing issue bug to an enhancement to then go ahead rarely worthwhile to monkey around with a working production system just to achieve an improvement that nonone else will ever note that this can play into your favour if an existing you can point out to management that the most way to fix things is to alter the database structure in this means you have management support for the changes and their backup if something turns pear practical thoughts one change at a and one make sure each change is correct before you move the old proverb of cut is automate never ever make the changes to the production system using sql server management write sql scripts that perform the entire change in one develop and test these against a of the database to make sure you get them use production as your test server you might accidentally run the script against use a dedicated test server the database size is under use sql server express running on your own the first step in any script should be to backup the so that got a way back if something does go if someone comes to you in twelve asking why feature of their application is need a history of the exact changes made to the database to help diagnosis and first good step is to keep all your change usually a good idea to keep the primary and foreign keys within the database and not revealed through the things that look like keys at a business level your work order have a disturbing habit of having introduce your keys as additional columns with appropriate but change the definitions of existing	
best bet is probably to create a by inheriting from the adding the required and exposing a meaningful property to a particular your custom gridview class could look like public class customgridview private gridviewcolumn private gridviewcolumn public new header new header public bool get return when hides the entire otherwise its width will be set to 0 you can simply set that property from xaml like in this you could make the a to be able to use it as a binding	
best bet is probably to use the default login controller provides and leave it where it this will allow you to more easily upgrade that plugin in the if you want a separate login form either break the login form out into a partial for reuse or implement your own but point it to the same controller used by the default for implementing administrative requirements on certain here is a good	
best bet is to create separate projects for your solution that references only those other projects you reference the same create a separate solution to hold those projects can all live together in the same folder and mystrippeddownproject1 reference and mystrippeddownproject2 reference and mystrippeddownproject3 reference references myproject1 and myproject2 and references mystrippeddownproject1 and references myproject2 and only references mystrippeddownproject2 it does not reference

best strategy is to have multiple that my best strategies anything you are sure of beyond doubt is a rock for bugs to hide if you never turn the rocks never find the hypotheses and test by test them i mean specifically come up with an experiment you can perform which will show one result if only your hypothesis is and something different if it is every few years spend a weekend watching old colombo get suckered in by only trust the baby biting off more than you can chew just means the problem till it has a razor sharp point on many that will give you the solution right of the in any you stand little chance of solving a problem you sure you can reproduce the find the simplest case that will reproduce the closest case to you simplest failure case that data that will answer not just fill up

best thing to do would be to never store data that if this were in a related table as it should then you could order to your hearts personally it would probably be fastest to at least split the data into a temptable or table variable that has an extra identity column and then sort in desc order on that

best to let the code itself explain it whereas the comments are there to describe like there is no number to stick if your 100 lines speak for comment at all or just provide a summary at the if there is some knowledge involved beyond what the code explain it in a code is too complicated to explain then that may be a reason to when you change the implementation you need to change the comments as as your comments do not duplicate the since the reasons for the design seldomly change safe to document them in comments for	
best way for tou to understand this different null values is to try them and see what the use of each one but to make things simple here is some can be used only on reference types like collections and custom classes is is for null values that came out of the db we cant assign null to a decimal or double we assign them with the minvalue property are value is a way for the developer to assign null values to value objects like is same as hope i helped you understanding the	
best way is to add the directory to the load path and then the basename of each this is because you want to avoid accidentally requiring the same file twice often not the intended whether a file will be loaded or not is dependent on whether has seen the path passed to it for this simple irb session shows that you can mistakenly require and load the same file require require require require that the first two lines return meaning the same file was loaded both when paths are even if the paths point to the same know that the file was already we add a directory to the load path and then require the basename of each file require you care about the file being required more than or your intention is just to load the contents of the perhaps should be used instead of use load in this because it better expresses what trying to for load file

big problem i see with bug reports from the field is that a programmer may have programmed to the specifications he was given and then the problem in the field was due to poor or incomplets me give you an you develop and test an application on windows vista 32 bit and then it fails at a coustomer site where they are running 64 bit windows was that the programmers fault if you never gave him a machine running xp 64 bit to test you realise that a bug can arise for lots of only some of which the programmer has control you need to be extremely careful that you do not setup an environment that leads to finger pointing and all members of the team need to be working together to make the product not spending their day trying to assign blame for bugs to someone you create an incentive system where someone gets bonus points for proving it was someone elses bugs need to be seen as owned by the entire	
binary distribution of rsync recognize the ssh the command you are trying to execute probably works fine when you put into the shell because something like bash knows how to interpret the ssh command to establish a use the ssh program to create a connection for the rsync from your debugging information i think rsync is expecting a connection but instead receives a string which it fails to get around this you have to let bash do the work for look at in the section on threads to tend the you would need to fork an instance of a command shell and write your command to the shell so something like p osw new bw new writing would probably want to read the processes output too because it will stop executing if you do not read the link provided covers the topic

bind your variables ocdecio not only does it prevent sql injection it is also much especially in a multi concurrency read for example variables are placeholders inside a sql when a database receives a sql it determines if the statement has already been executed and stored in if the statement does exist in oracle database can reuse it and skip the task of parsing and optimizing the bind variables makes the statement reusable with different input using bind variables also improves query performance in the eliminates the need for special handling of literal quotation marks in the and protects against sql injection	
binding is binding interface to its implementation at runtime any situation when the program automatically decides which code to call as interface so generally speaking both and are dynamic but the term is usually only used for binding early is the opposite of dynamic binding late in binding the knows exactly what code to call and gererates a direct call of that in dynamic binding the know that exact implementation is determined at

bit more answers given for the javascript version of this which has the same with aggressive javascript	
bit more detail might be you have your program you then create an event the function call to use is that event has two signalled and choose the state it starts you can now on that which is to you can for example give that event to an operating system function call and then wait on that when the operating system is it will change the state of the event to signalled and your function call will if only one this much use you could just call the operating system function and wait for it to but if you have multiple threads and you want to communicate between them you make function calls to other what you do instead is communicate with the other tell it to do something and give it the and then until program can have called a which is a thread which reading the programs message you can send a message to a thread and it will automatically be read by that so one use is if you have a number of threads is to issue a termination message time to another is to let the thread know you want it to do something and a message can take two integer values as so you can pass over the handle to an so the thread can signal you when its you could have it send you a message when its it all depends on how you want to organize your code event based or message

blog discusses the thought behind their latest improvements to the people selector problem they had to overcome was how to parse and otherwise handle so much data all your they tried getting xml and json via but found it too they then had this to say about loading the data via a dynamically generated script tag callback and dynamic script fast but with the theory that string manipulation was the with the last we from using ajax to instead the data using a dynamically script this means that contact data was never treated and was instead executed soon as it was just any other javascript difference in performance 89ms to parse contacts reduction of 3 orders while the smallest case 172 contacts only took the time per contact actually the larger the list approach looked except one in order for this json be we had to wrap it in callback any website in the world use the same approach to download flickr contact this a deal someone please go into the exact security risk here with a sample how is loading a given file via the attribute in a script tag different from loading that file via an ajax issue with dynamic script

buffering a request is not really something you can can consider staggering a user request for data over a set of http parsing and processing each http request as it comes if the user wishes to request records 1 to the client could first request records 1 to parse and render then request records 101 to 200 and so the first 100 records would display relatively quickly after a short the next 100 records would so long as the second 100 records displays before the user has managed to deal with the first 100 records it should be the overall time to complete the request will be however the web app will appear more responsive and the perceived task completion time will be should also consider switching from xml to json if not just updating the innerhtml property of an element with display to the user the response to an ajax the response must first be parsed into a data structure and then the parse time for both xml and json is pretty much the the difference lies in the time required to traverse and read the resulting data functions for traversing and accessing the data within the dom of a parsed response are relatively browser dom api methods mask the complexity of what is involved in dom traversing and make a slow process look nice and data in javascript objects resulting from the parsing of a response is much traversing a javascript object is easily 2 to 3 times faster than traversing a dom tree for the same set of recent tests i carried out with firefox beta 2 using 10mb of source traversing the dom of an xml response took about 30 doing the same for a javascript object populated from the same original large data set took about 15	
bug is described	
bug was a major issue for my worked around it a long time ago by using a conditional rule in an file that would disable all caching of images on the site for firefox this was a horrible thing to need to but at the time i track down the bug within firefox and having the site be slightly slower is better than showing i read in the linked bug that it was fixed in the latest firefox i changed the conditional on april 19th 2009 to only disable caching for firefox 2 few hours later received over 10 from firefox 3 users that they were seeing duplicate so this issue is still a problem in firefox decided to create a simple linux test program that would allow me to check to see if they are generating the same cache hash compile in any linux ffgenhash is the code to file long char unsigned long unsigned char s char h return char return you can here are two real life that generate the same cache hash i these images in a javascript trying to use some sort of empty tag workaround is not possible i think my only real solution is to modify the for firefox users in some way to generate a unique cache hash so the approach the half tempted to create a firebug addition that will check all resources loaded by a site and give a big error if two resources on the site share a common hash key so the developer is it would be great to run sites like google maps through this as seen weird things with those images over the past few years	
bugs are fairly easily and easy to what do you do when you run into ones that are hard or impossible to repro under of app is a app that is furthermore complicated by the fact that it communicates with multiple clients via remoting and sometimes bugs that can take weeks to track and sometimes we even be sure that the problem is fixed because of inconsistent it could be that just coincidence that the issue been seen for a already have an error reporting system so if lucky and the bug throws an exception get a stack but even not always enough because not obvious from the stack for instance how a certain value turned out to be null this is especially true when an exception occurs in a worker thread is the case most then you have ones that even throw just unexpected but it only happens a small percentage of is in so some of the work is hidden but we have many 3rd party components that managed code and a fair amount of com interop so it still gets a little no straightforward answers since not asking about a specific bug but what are some general concepts principles and tactics to go about tackling these kinds of is some advice for debugging really hard to track down

but a for loop probably what you when you use two for your inner loop keeps going back to the start every time the outer loop so if your vectors 10 9 8 4 7 6 4 3 your final array will contain something 10 10 10 10 9 9 9 9 9 8 8 8 8 8 7 6 4 4 4 7 6 4 3 you are testing every single and adding the larger one to the final a better solution might be to remember an iterator for each and just use one rather than looping over a just go through both of them together if sarray has the larger then increment your sarray and compare that with the old farray stop your loop when both sarray and farray are fiter siter traverse both farray and want to stop this loop once traversed both siter if we must have gone right through farray so use the value from and go to the next else if we must have gone right through sarray so use the value from and go to the next else if siter is the bigger of the two add it to the final go to the next sarray else fiter is the bigger of the two add it to the final go to the next farray tested it and if this is for then try to understand what go away and write it rather than

by forces the rdbms to requires resources that may not be present on your rdbms some cases you can write an order by that matches the indexes and if your rdbms guarantees that tables are kept in an index order it might be zero db design which depends on a lot of queries can be improved even more by discarding the rdbms and using order by is going to have to figured that getting the database to do it for me is the most assumption is the database is not necessarily more efficient than your program outside the

c is really not worth many of us who know c deeply like to think that all that deep insight is valuable and of us who know c think of a single specific feature of c helpful to know how pointers work in c with all that in a language your statements create objects and manage their pointers and references are perhaps interesting from a hypothetical point of but the knowledge has no practical impact on how you use java or languages are the way they knowing change those it change how you use debug or test how to create or manipulate a linked list has no earthly impact on python list class the difference between linked list and array list might help you write a java but the c implementation help you choose between linked list and array the decision is independent of knowing bad algorithm is bad in every knowing inner mysteries of c make a bad algorithm any less knowing c help you know the java collections or the python see any value in learning learning fortran is just as

came from webform development like from up until when i discovered mvc it took me about 6 months to convince my peers my that it is the way to of the highlights of my control of html ajax of update of using jquery exponentially increased of concern and faster is a little bit but i did try to prove it by building for my i built a simple dashboard web using both webform and i showed my peers and my boss the as well as the complexity of building and maintaining each in the we migrate our main methodology from webform to is true that it takes a while to some webform but once you get mvc is so much easier to pick up and you can run with yes it is but often in large we spend a lot of our time trying to or a server control to behave and perform like the way we want it and as complexity of the system goes the complexity of this customization also goes up ajax is also quite difficult in updatepanel has its but nested update panels has its own share of problems as me and my it boils down to the ability to control our instead of automatically generated by the framework but we have to spend a lot of time and effort to get the rest combined with and your prefered biz tier framework or is extremely so far to we have released 3 production releases with mvc and they all perform well heck take a look at uses mvc

co workers are if one thread locks a resource and another thread attempts to use it then your thread pool goes not very good most people resolve this by creating new objects and passing them into paramaterized if you absolutely need to use the same object then you must implement some code that first checks to see if the resource is being used by another thread and then waits a little while before checking an example would be to create a isinuse bool that you always check then your thread sets it to true if it is using that then false when it is preventing other threads from attempting to use the underlying resource i hope this

code is still not cart cart new new is because two threads can both get a of create new shopping cart and insert them into the one of them will meaning one will set the object used by future but the other will for this request use a totally different make this you would need to do something like following the idiom from the article you shoppingcart cart if cart new if the above if two threads using the same enter the loop at the same there is no data race that can cause them to use different address the part of the problem that brian goetz address in the namely how do you get the into the session in the first an easy and not way to do implement a session listener and put the empty objects into the session in its class sessioninitializer implements httpsessionlistener public void httpsession session new public void no special action method will be called once for each only when it is so this is an appropriate place to do any initialization that is needed for a the servlet spec does not require that there is a relationship between calling in your listener and calling your so this is apparently not guaranteed to be thread and can potentially vary in behavior between different servlet if there is even a chance that a given session can have more than one request in flight at a this is not safe in this you need to use a lock of some sort to initialize the you could do something like session ensure that the session is cartref if cartref new the above code has your session is the is guaranteed to be in the and in a you can either update the shopping cart object in the same synchronized block dispense with the all together just put the cart itself into the or you can update the with code shown earlier which is better depends on how much initialization you need to how long it will take to perform this on whether doing in the synchronized block will hurt performance too much is best determined with a not with a and so in my own i just use a synchronized block and use if i ever determined that synchronization was causing a liveness problem in my then i would potentially move some more expensive initializations out of synchronized blocks by using tricks like the httpsession thread are attribute thread safe

commented on post that i feel his answer is the if the goal is just to avoid two database then just in for a world of unnecessary your reference to if you are looking instead for a solution to that allows you to defer official saving in some you may wish to have a look at the function in the inner function is how the delayed save is accomplished for implementing something for models without forms would basically follow the same said and coming back to the case of a modelform and an actual model are somewhat because forms expose only a set of data to be edited in a browser because it is filtered in some or excludes critical fields that a user be it is a reasonable design expectation that someone might need to add important information to the model before this is why django has the expectation falls down for cases where you are directly instantiating here you have programmatic access to the model so you will probably find that using that api directly is easier to maintain and less error prone than through generalized i can understand why you are picturing the factory but in this case you may find the effort to create a generalization for all manner of models is a complication just not worth

company develops and sells a saas application that has hundreds of some of our customers have asked us to support ldap integration for authenticating user accounts against their existing systems instead of having to create another login account for each of their seems like this is referred to as single sign on in many naturally our system already has a mechanism for maintaining user account profiles and authenticating those user accounts from our login a bit ignorant about ldap and are confused about a few please excuse the possible use of wrong terminology a little ignorant about think we understand the basics of how this might customer configures their account to the feature for their they provide the remote url that will authenticate their come to our login page and attempt a login using their username and password provided by their ldap login page will securely forward the login credentials encrypted and hashed in some agreed upon to the url provided by our script will authenticate the user and then redirect them back to our site with the page will analyze the and either accept the user as logged in or the above information is even still need each user to have an account in our we need some way to synchronize our user account profiles with the user profiles in the ldap is this simply an that references the id in the ldap would it then be required that the script must provide that id to our system so we know which user account in our system to associate the login are we our platform is and sql server to build ldap integration for my web

company is looking to replace all websites in the group with a new system and similar with functionality being added in a future too big a job for me to do in a reasonable so we are going to be inviting tenders from currently in the process of defining the technical and intending to dictate that the selected system must have a strict doctype and must trigger standards mode almost standards in common or something to that effect have to allow almost standards mode to cater for done a bit of homework an all of this i want the spec to be limited by my after all but it surprise you all that found that is completely divided on what is good are plenty of people who advocate strict plenty of people who recommend strict served as ok with this some who recommend html5 restricted to still not sure if this is a good idea or but i see the but also a number people on other so who recommend just understand the reasoning for you may happen to want to temporarily use something that been and thus transitional seems but some people recommend xhtml transitional for new checking out other sites for design notice that many sites they have any doctype specified at will refer to a transitional we all know there is plenty of crap on the so perhaps i draw too many but checking out web design agencies that come there are an amazing proportion of them vast majority of i would are using xhtml so you necessarily have to be an expert to call yourself a web but the sheer volume of transitional layouts makes me most of the sites seem to be otherwise reasonably designed accessible having finally got to the is there some reason why such a large proportion of these agencies are opting for transitional am i missing something that i need to consider for my new i realise the purpose of the transitional dtd i was just suspicious that so many web developers are clinging on to deprecated i wonder if you guys are correct and the answer is simply that they are are too lazy to get their own website to or sticking with the default dtd of their preferred key for me is that to your responses so i seem to be missing out on some key reason to use a transitional regarding our cms project all the agencies thankfully seem to have their heads screwed on valid and is xhtml transitional so

correct that you should not inherit from stl virtual functions would make them meaningfully larger the base size of vectors would jump from 12 to 16 bytes the implementation besides virtual functions are difficult to which can slow down the if you find yourself making an array of a million the difference adds up pretty can still get the effect you want by declaring the vector as a member variable in your itemlist and then thunking through any methods that you wish to itemlist item typedef item int int item offset return const return and so this is a fair amount of grunt but it will give you the effect you asked

creating a we might want to create a tempory password for the user which is stored using sha1 free to suggest other cryptography long should we make the tempory too it could be brute too long and the unnecessary length is redundant since the string is hashed a 20 character and 50 character string results in a hash of the same length if this was sure we can pick a number out of the but i was wondering if there was a good mathematical reason to pick 13 rather than tempory password length for sha

current intranet environment is a little the current stack has applications that are querying against a sql 2000 role there are user groups on the servers that users are added into you need to be added into the group on the test and production these user groups are synchronized into user roles on sql 2000 roles are granted execute permissions to stored procedures as needed to prevent any access the web application we use basic authentication authenticates against our active and have identity impersonation turned the connection string to the database uses integrated this creates an environment where the web application connects to the database as the user logged which will enforce database security on stored procedures being it also allows us to use the typical method to perform authorization within the application are several problems with the first is that only our server administrators have access to the user groups on the so updating role or adding additional users is out of the hands of the application in the only way to get the role was to call a sql procedure called which is locked down in sql while i know the full our dba tells us that this general model play nice with sql 2005 given the nature of schemas in the newer at the point now that ready to update our writing apps to leverage more ajax and sql server 2005 is the primary environment for our looking to update the security model as well to be a bit more flexible for the application and potentially leverage active directory concern we have as well is that a given user will most likely have access to multiple so having some kind of centralized solution is optimal so we can easily remove users when is considered the best practice for maintaining role security in this kind of is the best practice for role security for an intratnet

currently fighting with the viewstate and it is starting to wear me having found that some of the pages in one of our applications is made up of around viewstate i have looked into reducing this where i have looked at am happy disabling viewstate for controls that do not need it buttons and have made some small gains now looking at viewstate compression and while i can demonstrate a decrease in size it does not seem to be playing well with my contains a few dropdown a button and a grdiview the need to deal with the when the page loads the ddls are populated and default selections are pressing the ok button results in the gridview being populated as the with viewstate compression if the user changes the selected items in the ddls before clicking the ok button they will get a field error indicating that a selection has not been made in one of the ddls but this is not the disabling the compression code removes the problem and the page operates as expected as it has for the problem be down to the viewstate now being stored in a key other than code that i have seen use different key names vstate for page sources look like source with compression the empty source without does know where the viewstate is stored and does it know that i have moved i need to make any other changes to my code apart from implementing savepagestatetopersistencemedium and got to the bottom of this well i have it some reason using the method appears to have been the source of the modifying the code to utilise the base class save and processing the pair object returned by i now have a working test show a reduction of aroun on the test page so pretty happy with that i have compression working i need to recommend that the next code review has a focus on removing viewstate where it is not to eveyone who responded to my cry for help saved me a few grey hairs compression issues

cursory examination of your code reveal any obvious though you seem to be using a lot of variables with global scope so always possible that got some conflicts that we one potential problem may be that reusing ids since you rely on the same variable to generate the ids for you could test this by having your textboxes named instead of than my recommendations would be to use firebug in firefox and set some breakpoints in the code to see what values are being beyond you might want to think about how you could simplify your code by refactoring to reusable functions for creating a creating a using parameters to provide the attribute since it appears you are using some sort of framework the is idiomatic of several you might also want to see if your framework has a way to handle creating dom elements in a more elegant

david points out the main problem is to differentiate between idle users and users that have left your possible solution would be to keep a low session timeout 1 or 2 and using a callback function to keep the session alive for idle then you could increment a counter in and decrement it in and use it to keep track of the number of active if the number of active sessions goes beyond your limit you would redirect the new user to a page that abandons the session and tells the user that you have too many visitors at the

designing i often end up resorting to the following which i like as it results in lots of basic pattern code using the library hands an object to the the library then hands the object back to the calling the calling code is forced to cast the as the library hands back a generic code example library defines the following objects and function creatething procedure processthing doeverything calling code then uses the library by overriding the objects and calling as follows x xsum function creatething procedure processthing result xsum xsum as is the the caller is forced to cast to do processor class is also a tthing the library guarantees that it will only pass tthings to the corresponding tthingprocessor that created so it but while the code above is a bit stupid in that it really do it shows why processthing simply be shifted to tthing and be polymorphic the xsum variable needs to be can i restructure the code so the cast is i need to keep the library code separate but be able to accept any the to an due to suggestion so it will at least throw exception instead of crash in the case of mismatched casting when passing objects through library code

details of the i can only speculate that the web service implementation is throwing a runtime exception that is not an instance of the soapfault or axisfault classes their the default behavior in in a such a would be to deliver the error page in the since web services are servlets after usually indicates that the web service must handle the exceptions appropriately and throw an appropriate soap to prevent the exception from trickling up the call stacktrace would help in establishing the root cause of this but going to shoot in the dark anyway can refer to the issue and see if that is the actual cause of the to put it from the information one can use soap not sure about the fix having been propagated to axiom since i did not see any reference to	
develop a certain till two versions could not be installed at the same now changing and the question came should the version number be appended to the server components or the server contains 3 exes and 5 dlls some native should any or all have their name contain the version or the pros it should make managing the server a bit if a certain instance misbehaves it would be identifiable in the task no chance a bad installation will end with having mixed components versions without it being the cons it would make development a bit the server is not a standalone but rather a part of our applications this means it gets the main that a certain component will have to get a different name even if it changed at all between in this is not a crucial we can probably get along with both having that i might have missed a winner argument in favor of one of the what is the common what do you familiar with com and file metadata and agree filename versioning is trying to figure out more significant the constant redundancy or the rare gain in executables contain version numbers in their

difference is that the value of a static readonly field is set at run and can thus be modified by the containing whereas the value of a const field is set to a compile time the static readonly the containing class is allowed to modify it the variable declaration a variable the static constructor if not readonly is typically used if the type of the field is not allowed in a const or when the value is not known at compile readonly fields are also that for reference in both cases and the readonly modifier only prevents you from assigning a new reference to the it specifically does not make immutable the object pointed to by the public static readonly test test new static void test new a static readonly field cannot be assigned to in a static constructor or a variable public string difference is that static can be modified by the containing but const can never be modified and must be initialized to a compile time to expand on the static case a the containing class can only modify in the variable declaration a variable in the static constructor constructors if not keyword in const string abc only at is evaluated at compile time and can not be changed at run attempt to change it will cause a compilation is already kind of classes and structs are initialized at run time with new you set a constant to a class or it has to be one of the integral keyword in readonly string be initialized in declaration code or consturctor is evaluated at run be declared as static or instance level read only field can hold a complex object by using the new keyword at run kumar

difficult to fully answer your question without specifying a programming answer with respect to because for all i know the answer might be is a then a server first binds to a port by calling this creates a socket in server it is prepared to catch data on port one calls this throws the socket into server this means that a request for a connection will be received by this socket to 10 pending requests at a the time we get to the operating system already knows listening on port merely says what going to do with the requests we in will return where connection is a connection through another in this is not very different from the socket object that the client has reasonably symmetric from here on	
directly answer your but i have already tried the approach that you propose but would now create a single jar per application how to do it that no need to include anything in the all you i find it cleaner but everything is make any difference from a performance since each application is run inside its own only downside is that some libraries will be present in each jar it only costs more to store on the but these mb are pretty cheap i trade simplicity external lib and no jar hell placing your jars inside the java ext over storage price any if your application include terrabyte of i think the log4j configuration i would place one default file inside the jar but provide a sample config file that someone can modify and specify in the command	
directory can fulfill two related but seperate functions for an authorization and is validating that the person using your application is a valid if you have the credentials the application prompts the user for their username and you can authenticate them against ad by attempting a connection using their is what lets you determine the level of permissions a particular user has in your active directory groups are a relatively straightforward and flexible way to implement the various permissions i will create very permissions groups that represent each securable action users can perform in the application caneditwidgets then create functional or role groups where you place the users for that role you just nest the role groups into the permissions groups so for the business requirement is that managers can delete you would add the managers group as a member of the candeletewidgets while this may seem more it makes it extremely simple to respond to changing business security requirements need to be able to delete piece of add the technicians role group to the candeletewidgets permissions group and far as logging in there are a number of ways you can automatically log in a for winforms you should just be able to grab the currently logged in user and use for web if you can use integrated you end up with the same your web server will handle the authentication piece and send over the of the user in a server header

do most of my work with microsoft technologies these so naturally checking out what wcf has to it seems very flexible and a great next step up from but it seems very tied to soap messages and quite a bit clunky for a platform agnostic web service not an expert on the but i imagine all of this flexibility touting means that you can break away from soap messages and return whatever data you is this true or reason i say this is that if i really wanted to create an application as a rest one of my target platforms would be not just one important goal of any web based service is to keep the data payload small whether for a mobile at dial up speeds or a full desktop if you take api as an it has been incredibly successful because you can request the data as json with no fancy soap envelopes weighing the data down and receive the smallest amount of bytes to represent the data you so a mobile application running on a device with poor connectivity consuming data can use the least amount of bandwidth besides the pattern of or any of the more successful public is a custom data structure in json xml and not wrapped in a soap envelope i could be is just my would you do this in do you have to jump through hoops to tell wcf to return this worry about the soap or is it a simple config as a web service with the smallest possible

do you try to the part going wrong the source code is irrelevant at this may indeed be necessary to put the applet and the html page that contains it in a webserver in order for it to be able to connect to the database due to the security restriction that applets are only allowed to connect to the server loaded note that except for a learning an applet should never connect directly to a database because inherently whoever runs the applet can decompile it and get the db user and password and in your case why decompile when you could just guess it at that the users and passwords inside your db become they can do anything the db user read all data and log in as an arbitrary user at the very and probably add and delete data at will as do you mean with shows the no your and the html file in is and the file is not from the html it may be that all you have to do is to remove the codebase attribute of the applet tag it would only be corret if the java file were in a subdirectory named when you talk about what you in the that sounds the jdbc url has nothing to do with the html location in for where you put the method that connects to the database does not the classes are all part of the applet as far as the browser is

easy to make a big deal out of to my mind it is a pretty and useful it quantifies on you will learn from an like flipping a taking a branch or indexing an a comparison operation in the middle of a search algorithm has a certain probability p of taking one and of taking the p is as it is in a binary then if you take that you know 1 bit more than you did because base is on the other if you take the other branch you also learn 1 get the average amount of information you will multiply what you learn on the first branch times the probability you take that plus what you learn on the second branch times the probability of that times 1 plus times 1 is bit plus or total 1 bit of what you can expect to learn on average from that the other suppose you are doing linear search in a table of 1024 the first the probability of yes is so the entropy of yes at that decision times 10 about if the answer is you learn 10 but the chance of that is about 1 in a the other no is much more entropy roughly 1 times roughly zero about the two and on average you will learn about of a bit on that why linear search is the entropy much you can expect to at each decision is too since going to have to learn 10 bits to find the entry in the

even simpler than hashtable is nothing more than an array of vectors which contain the maximum size of this array is typically smaller than the number of items in the set of possible values for the type of data being stored in the hash algorithm is used to generate an index into that array based on the values of the item that will be stored in the is where storing vectors of pairs in the array come because the set of values that can be indexes in the array is typically smaller than the number of all possible values that the type can it is possible that your hash algorithm is going to generate the same value for two separate a hash algorithm will prevent this as much as possible is why it is relegated to the type usually because it has specific information which a general hash algorithm possibly but impossible to of you can have multiple keys that will generate the same hash when that the items in the vector are iterated and a direct comparison is done between the key in the vector and the key that is being looked if it is great and the value associated with the key is nothing is

explicitly specializing a function without fully specializing all outer template is not possible explicit function specialization is a real function there be any around it that are still parameterized by a simple way is to use a type2type template together with struct t2t typedef t parm1 arg2 class class v void parm1 parm2 class type void parm1 parm2 it will call the second overload if you call it with and the first because the first one is less is possible parm1 arg2 class type typename parm1 parm2 class type typename parm1 parm2 the second one is taken if is and the first one is taken if is something else but using a different this one is called an alternative but which again adds one parameter is this to demonstrate the way sfinae parm1 arg2 class type parm1 parm2 class type parm1 parm2 happens if the substitution of a template parameter yields to an invalid type or we try to create a pointer to an array of size 0 or 1 an array of size 0 is not and will cause an sfinae failure the corresponding template specialization will not be considered as a if it is a the case it works if is given something derived from then it makes its typedef not derives itself from in the case types are not the we would then try to access a not existent name which is an invalid construct and would therefor be an sfinae failure

fairly unsafe this is new create now store it in a cast it back to set the int to last line is unsafe because a can point to what happens in your hmyclass does point to a myclass the cast will but at runtime your code does not compile as hmyclass is a type not a you would need something as a handle or thehandle foo edit fixed the code i missed an the denotes a it differs from a pointer in that a reference is just an alias to a while a pointer only there was a on this go with the integer example new create now store it in a cast it back to set the int to this dereferences the acts just like a normal but is an alias to the same as no the integer is still this is because references are only assigned on the line they are this line is the same as which has no has the value of still has a value of is but both still since is not a reference or pointer to original the original int is now and since the original it too is now is still that more information and

far i have been exiting and reentering the interpreter because re importing the file again is not working for just saying again gives you the existing copy of the module from can say to update and get a new copy of that single but if any other modules have a reference to the original module any object from the original they will keep their old references and very confusing things will if got a module which depends on module and you have to followed by if got two modules which depend on each which is extremely common when those modules are part of the same you reload them if you reload get a reference to the old and vice the only way to do it is to unload them both at once by deleting their items from before importing them this is icky and has some practical pitfalls to do with modules entries being none as a if got a module which passes references to its objects to system example it registers a or adds a warnings you reload the system module without confusing the rest of the python for all but the simplest case of one module being loaded by one standalone is very tricky to get as you you are using a you will probably be better off continuing to cycle the

feel that the mvc pattern as a framework for data driving web applications does seems to require less verbosity and hence less code with dynamic languages like python and which is a good languages make it easy to avoid the dependency between the v and c which is one of the purposes of the for example in python you can just pass your model objects to the view without the view requiring a dependency on the model it just cares that any type with the same attributes is passed once you start using a templating language in the like in it even cause script errors when an attribute avoid these dependency in a strongly typed you often start passing passing around dictionaries with literal strings as meaning most of the benefits of strongly type languages are lost your compiler tell you named a key and then attempt to find it with a key this will be discovered at given the mvc pattern lends itself to testing by allowing the v and c to be tested there is less advantage using strongly typed compiled language as tests can be used to validate your application is working as it should

fine folks over at have gnu make for as a native it works but does have a few minor quirks due to a hack that tries to equate a target named with the file the gnuwin32 package does include a nice pdf of the use it on xp alongside gcc from the as well as with several different embedded systems cross compiler mingw also provides a native build of gnu do use cygwin for a couple of in particular one where the vendor provided a working toolchain and build environment hosted in moving it to a native windows shaped build would be prohibitively and would make it harder to accept updates from the you want to use mostly native windows but need to start by running configure on an existing source then take a look at this started as a fork of cygwin by the mingw and it intends to provide a minimal set of tools with a bash shell so that configure can be used on it as complete as but it is a lot lighter will find that the manual for gnu make is mostly you have to keep in mind that the content of a makefile is not written in a single the stuff that defines variables and lays out the dependancy tree is one each line of an action is a miniature shell script that is in the language of the default shell might be rather than on and each command has options and you are comfortable with your build then cygwin might be the path of least but msys is often and there is something to be said for adopting the native tools of the target platform so that you have a sense of how your users see in which case mingw and gnuwin32 are handy resources to know

for about a second the alt attribute given this case then it hides and shows the image when the image is what alt text is it provides a textual alternative for when the image because an or images are turned off in the browser in this the file just arrived alt text really what you unless the image in question actually contains the words the above is inappropriate alt if talking about one of those little icons that opens a a better alt text would be as a description of what the image opposed to what it would be better applied to the attribute used for that if using quirks mode and the image has a fixed size firefox will use a icon with the alt text overlaid and cropped instead of the plain alt text on its this is to match old but you really want to use quirks and in the common case where the fixed size is the cropping makes the alt text unreadable and is a problem because during that split second the layout stretches to fit the wider words making it look unprofessional in my getting over how the web any page can move about a bit as it renders for images you should only ever see it happen then the image will be cached and will appear straight if it something wrong with the cacheing on what kind of layout you are talking you can perhaps fix that to not respond to the changing image for example if using a setting on the table and number on the top image cell will make it stick to that width even if the text inside is possibly causing the alt text to run over into the next cell

for email is essentially the same as html for the the difference is that your email message is being treated like being in the untrusted restricted which means you cannot use javascript or any other scripting can embed attachments in the mail style and so or reference them from an external fact is that if you reference them from an external most email readers will not download them without the approval of the this means that often it is better to put css between style tags in the header and images like inline reading mail in thunderbird or obviously there are one uses the rendering engine of one uses this is the same as making pages for the you take those points into you should be able to make nice looking email messages without a this

for functional any time you have a common coding pattern and want to reduce a while ago i wrote a bit on using for functional while making sure functional hesitate to link to my own stuff but i think relevant in this if you have a common how expressions are lovely in pattern matching be too in there are tons of patterns that pop up at a coding using higher order you can make them go as i show in that set of blog my favourite example is the pattern is so common it got turned into a language same thing for those are both trivially represented as higher order and only because support them originally do we need language keywords to support switch your blocks out to use a readerwriter have to write a higher order function perhaps convincing just requires looking at generics aka parametric hardly but a nice functional concept everyone the cute ninject framework work without as expression how fluent get all their that come from oo or imperative the new threading pretty ugly without functional programming has been blessing things like over the last the major advances as are directly from functional why not realise something to it and get more involved in how phrase it to bigger is actually getting people to make the jump in understanding to higher order while quite if never seen it before in your it might be shocking an seems like a lot of people think generics are just for and linq is just embedded what you should do is go through your and find places that are an imperative search for the underlying and use functions to string it together if you find you might settle for just off for example all the foos in this list and remove a 1 line thing in functional style versus 7 lines in style a temp loop through and add loop though and remove the hope is even though the syntax is people will recognize a lot if they can put down the more and looks for a have a

for some insight into for your topline suggestion said is to standardize a response structure both success and that your handler looks catching all exceptions at the server layer and converting them to the same for example have reached your max number of foos for the field is ssn or mrn must be is not in bernalillo only bernalillo residents are is the approach stackoverflow uses case you were wondering how others do this kind of write operations like voting have and regardless of if the vote was allowed or pointed you should be consistent in whatever you this is easier said than done is everything in if you submit comments too quickly on instead of being consistent and only comment once every will throw a server exception and catch it in their much as it to use jquery http imo it will add more complexity to your code base than realize that jquery does not error codes but rather the lack of a success this is an important distinction when trying to design a client around http response codes with you only get two choices it a or which you have to branch further on your if you have a small number of webservices driving a small number of pages then it might be but anything larger scale may get much more natural in a webservice wcf for that to return a custom object than to customize the http status plus you get the json serialization for

from your main fname the method being static void readdata bufferedreader br new have an incompatibility is a method takes a as a constructor takes a not 2d of these three should be the same data can i separate each with zero shown in the image link have you have to read from that file with the zeros in would recommend you write a method something like method line by line until it encounters a 0 each entry it reads convert the value into a number the number in a temporary you encounter the create a new array of the correct size and copy the read values into can i write the output into a separate a hardest bit of this imo is the fact that you are told to store the data in a 2d but you exactly what size to make the array until read the means that you either use a temporary dynamic or read the file twice once to find out how many receipts there are so that you can make the and then again to actually read the receipt

fun i hope you never have to deal pointers can whereas arrays aliasing can cause all sorts of code the most common of which is using a pointer as an out parameter to another the compiler cannot assume that the pointer used by the function alias itself or anything else in that stack so it has to reload the value from the pointer every time or to be safe it

functions like usually get a character from the keyboard or standard they are sometimes used at the end of programs like do many know what the e stands for in are then used to give the user the change to see the output of the before the terminal windows closes that happens in note that there is a portable function called in c and that does also do that job for an enter in but that cause a harm it is not used to terminate the after a key is control continues and then after main the program and recent c versions insert a implicitly after the last statement of the main function stands for this means your main function returns a value of back to the but you can return other values if you write the return explicitly and put another value that value is what it terminates your and returns the given value back to the some other stuff never program will return a value of 42 to the normally you just there and it has the same effect not if you have local the destructor of those are not called if you use but they are cleanly destructed and destructors are called when you use prefer in main when you exit called in other functions than your main will terminate your program so it can be required to use that because return there will just return from those specific functions and do not at all terminate the

further support ivans answer above lucene is the way to you mentioned what platform on so point out that you can use a port of this you do use lucene there is a very good book from manning on the subject which i recommend you look it comes to populating your you have a couple of for starters you can just dump all of your text into the index and allow the engine to just search on recommend adding fixed fields to your index which will allow you to support things such as partitioned searches or searches against those fields lets say you have a field for the then you can partition your index by restricting the index search to those documents that have that website in that other process is to extract points of interest from your document and allow searches on those without searching the entire index your mileage may vary with this as the lucene engine is very well written so it may simply allow you to collect your searches into more logical units which helps you with your done this myself and it helps when answering management questions about what exactly is searched and

group has two major documentation systems and it seems to work we have a where the product managers describe new enhancements and post i use those pages to figure out what to and qa uses them to figure out a also use qa enters bugs and the pms enter enhancements as trac tied into so a page for every each ticket is linked to the checkin that fixed it automatically via parsing the svn commit and each checkin page has a file so pretty easy to search for a problem and see how it was actually have a couple of other development groups working on products that share our database but not our they each track their bugs and commits separately their own trac we share the because those pages specify the interfaces between about all the documentation we the though is largely and if grep is your	
group is building a process modelling application that simulates an industrial the final output of this process is a set of number representing chemistry and flow application is based on some very old software that uses the exact same underlying mathematical model to create the thousands of variables are involved in the each component has been unit we now need to be able to make sure that the data output produced by our software matches that of the old simulation i am wondering how best to approach this issue in a formalised and rigorous old program works by specifying the input via a text so i was thinking we could programatically take each adjust its value in the file correspondingly in our new then compare the outputs between the new and old we do this for every variable in the know the allowable range for each variable so i suppose a random sample across each variable of a few values is enough to show correctness for that particular thoughts on this any other testing for process modelling

guess that you be sending the xml file to the webservice over and over will want to modify its content every time for that you have all of the above apply then you need the xml you just need the class that generates the file at the xml is just the today its xml and tomorrow it might be some other format	
guess the advantage of having your xml reside there in your project solution is that you can maintain it in vs with nice formatting and even but then using something like xml spy or whatever can give you that refer to it in a class need to ensure you have access to and that it resides in a reliable the past used post build events to move the latest copy of the file to where i need as arnshea writes here is another the output you can use the to output property on the xml file itself to achieve then your classes can use the xml knowing it will reside in a reliable need to make sure accessible though especially if writing back to make sure it end up as source control system could do to storing these files in a folder under program files could also be problematic especially on where user privileges are

guideline we use prefer const over you tend to use const you get used to using only constant operations on the objects you get and that is as much as using as much as has a once you get to use it propagates to all your your methods become and that requires using only constant operations on the and passing constant references that itself forces only constant the performance advantage of using constant iterators over non constant iterators any at is much less important than the improvement in the code operations meant to be

had once a situation where i had to override the event handler in some derived class of i could not unfortunately just it since the implementation logic was bound strictly to that particular method implementation in the base natural idea was to first the original event handler from the event and then to bind my own so i tried to use the operator new eventhandler which point the compiler complainer that it had no access to the private method since the base class was a part of the library i did not really want to modify its implementation simply as it seems by just turning into so simple to attach an event handler to an why is it so difficult to get rid of i wanted because the base implementation was casing some problems did not handle our particular so i wanted to redefine but even after i attached my event handler the base implementation was getting executed since it was doing some kind of my own implementation was never going to run since the request processing was being broken at server after there anyway to get rid of an event handler in a base class from a library without modifying its to an event handler attached to an event in the base class when in a derived

had to be there in at that there were a few commercial smalltalks but the biggest was visualworks from parcplace the marketers at parcplace were idiots choosing to optimize for max dollers per seat rather than max any shop wishing to adopt smalltalk had to pay a couple thousand dollars per developer for a any developer wishing to learn smalltalk either had to get hired to do smalltalk or sink serious cash into buying his own so it was just plain hard to get a chance to learn about that ibm was looking for a successor to cobol for their business they chose smalltalk and developed visualage and made it so the same program could run without modification on everything from mainframes to as400s to smalltalk has a friendly minimal syntax and is easy to learn so it seemed a natural replacement for the future looked really bright for the companies that were using it were everyone else by a sun showed up with they gave it away free instead of charging for ibm took a look at it and figured two first they want to enter a marketing war with sun that was clearly planning to spend a fortune on the java instead they decided to try to beat sun at their own game have the best java on the why they already had a great vm that ran on their whole stack they just adapted it to handle the java bytecode in all of java tools were actually written in smalltalk for several thus if one wants to blame anyone for the rise of java over smalltalk it is pretty easy to place the blame directly at the feet of ibm and their unwillingness to love i love coding in the being able to archive processes and restore them exactly later if they encounter the amazing the economy of expression and the brilliant class there is a new resurgence in smalltalk development thanks to pharo has some really beautiful ui the new cog seaside and these are all projects working on addressing the historical shortcomings of smalltalk including the poor os integration has a slick native widgets integration and have a new external code integration capability called and i mind that smalltalk that makes it a secret weapon for me and i am really encouraged to see all the new development smalltalk is growing and advancing again and this is good because a lot of the best ideas in software unit refactoring coding all were developed in smalltalk first and then filtered out to the rest of the world in diluted other limitation at the time for smalltalk was application packaging and the lack of dynamic loading large smalltalk applications had to rebuild the image file and redeploy for a java provided dynamic linking at runtime which provided many benefits to packaged by the time smalltalk added dynamic java had won mindshare at ibm so they stopped investing in time

happens if there is a problem accessing the log file when you initialize the log can happen if you initialize the log system if you run your program while another copy is running and writing to the log or if you are editing the log file in a text basically anything that causes a write lock on the log file when log4net init your code for duplicate calls to log4net init perhaps you are initializing in a constructor instead of in a static constructor or global for can also happen if you are running in a configuration and include the pid in the because each different web server process tries to write to the same if using web gardens and writing to add the pid to the filename pattern so each server process gets its own

hard to find that kind of did find a link for dao	
hard to give a good answer without a little more kind of performance do you linear is fine then i would just use a list of dates and iterate through the list collecting all dates that fall within the as you have duplicates in the you need to have repeated dates in your collection then most implementations of a binary tree would probably be something like treeset are set implementations and allow repeated are the access lots of lookups with few or fairly datastructures have between lookups and if doing lots of updates then some datastructure that are optimized for lookups be so what are the access characteristics of the data what kind of performance do you and what are structural characteristics that it must support must allow repeated

have a complicated background image with a lot of small regions that need rollover illustration along with additional text display and associated links for each the final illustration stacks several static images with transparency using and the highlight rollover illustrations need to display in one of the layers to achieve the desired some unsuccessful fiddling with i decided this might be done with an image i made a schematic test map with four geometric shape outlines and them using with png the idea is to associate the image map with the bottom background initialize all the rollovers with css and use hover method to make them visible as well as reveal associated text in a separate the separate text function is why not trying to this with the pseudoclass instead of jquery because i was using the image i made all the rollover pngs have transparent sized to the full container for exact placement so everything lines up i got not the image map is correctly mapped to activate only the geometric but the href from each rollover area works only and using jquery hover with css visibility is messed desired behavior is that rolling into the area simply would make the shape what actually happens is any motion inside the shape makes rapid toggling between visible and when the cursor stops within the it might be visible or it might any ideas hover setup ultimately use arrays for real associated links and border jquery hover with html image

have a pretty good experience with both mysql and i found postgresql to be more faster and better but i recommend it you have to know what looking for in a db to be able to i had experience in putting postgresql to be a good replacement for sql server in environments where we migrated everything from sql server to and did much better with the same hardware from windows to linux as also gives you way more options to optimize your and tune your database in general as long as know what you can mess around as you wish in its configuration one thing that kills me in mysql is the damn it kills a file that can be and nowhere to be you can even have a file in your home dir and depending on your configuration and how you invoke your it can wildly interfere with the works of the had serious troubles with servers with randomly placed giving me big headaches to find in the world was mysql getting its much better to have just one or two as postgresql also found postgresql to be a decent replacement for oracle in certain where oracle really necessary to begin but somehow somebody got convinced business person flooded with the nonsense sales arguments probably was the person who made the and bought it was totally and we could replace it without any major problems by it was a while version of but yet it made a good job in replacing it was a fairly big database and postgresql was up to the postgresql supports some nice features like stored procedures can be in or whatever languages postgresql supports also have some experience with and have worked with it since its version so for a mysql is generally very good if you mind about the inner workings of the or if you need a competent database to do something cool and it can be really really and you can really get in trouble and get cornered in the future if you think about what one thing that i hate the most is the ability to choose your storage while it sounds great in i can all it is in reality not very the main flaw with it is no matter which engine you always gain and lose stuff in for if you want referential integrity foreign keys and you use and humble along with the poorer not necessarily just worse performance of innodb also features lots of silly size and quantity of you have tables with more than 1000 columns in it literally kills mysql when we talk about data gives me the feeling that mysql is a sewed thing between many different other products used to be a company in the db you just have to download the source code of both to see the while the source code of postgresql is more source code is source tree is not as organized as and oh that makes a huge difference when you another fact that supports my argument about the source code is the build postgresql build is much faster than sometimes i think that rebuild my kernel is faster than rebuilding killer thing for if in the business of selling as in a software house or software provider or something like is their crappy licensing i but they have an enterprisey license mode as and if you want to package mysql for distribution with your you just do it without paying them royalties fees and on the other is licensed under so you can do just whatever you want with it even improve it and sell a also another aspect that like to mysql is actively maintained by mysql a privately held and postgresql is totally supported by the opensource no strings attached to any the query oh let me start on the query mysql query planner just not for from but if you go deeper and starts to put queries with and the planner just gives up on you and starts to read each row in the bringing your application wake you up in the middle of the getting directly to the mysql is great if you want have a kind of reliable to use in simple mysql easy synchronization come in handy when we need to build a high availability and is also great for load use any kind of lamp you name just and works and is easy to at cheap hosting company is better if need to have a more reliable solution to supply your business something that can to and replace sql server and is supports advanced database like stored procedures in many different different transaction isolation synchronization is not as trivial as in but it just works other resources that may be

have a scenario in which we like to detect when the user has left our site and immediately expire their using forms not talking about a session which we already we would like to know when a user has browsed away from our either via a by typing in an address or following a if they return to our even if right they will have to log back in understand this is not great usability this is a security requirement been given by our initial instinct is that this is either not or that any solutions will be extremely the only solutions come up with a javascript onblur event handler that tells the server to log out the session when the user leaves the the user has logged check the http referrer to ensure that the user has navigated from within the ajax polling back to the server to keep the session possibly on a when the call received on time the session would onblur seems like the but possibly least reliable method not sure if it would even there are also issues with the referrer as the user could type in an address within the site and not follow a the ajax method seems like it would but complicated not even sure how to handle it on the thinking there might also be scenarios in which that always ideas would be do i force expiration of an session when a user leaves the

have a scheduled task that runs a script on a regular basis this script does some heavy interaction with the database and filesystem and regularly takes several minutes to the problem the spikes while the script is running and slows down normal is there a way to throttle this process so that it takes longer but does not consume as many looked at different configuration options for php but there does not appear to be any that fit my in to something lower causes my data objects to overflow quite seen similar posts where people suggested using at certain points in the script but that does not prevent the script from spiking the optimal solution would be some way to tell the lamp this case stack to only use max cpu not concerned at all about runtime and would prefer that it take longer if it means saving cpu cycles per my alternate solution would be to setup a different server with database replication so the cron could go to town without slowing everything else windows server apache php mysql appreciate any insight to this i appreciate all the even the ones that are still early enough in my situation to change the hosting hopefully this question will help others out regardless of the for throttling a php

have a variety of problems in your you should not embed your connection string in code you should pull it from a config file so that you can change it when you log in to your database with the sa just do it trust me on this strongly recommend that you use an idisposable interface and a using block to ensure that your connection is as it you are depending on the consuming code to call this sample class myconnclass public static string connectionstring protected sqlconnection public conn new public void your initialization code in a web set the static connection string as your consuming classes use something myconn new database the other thing i would suggest that you consider is to modify the above code so that it forms the basis for a data access layer and not just the that place a sql command object in there as well and create code to simplify your overall data access that just putting the in a separate class is a bit useless as joel points sqlconnection objects are themselves the advantage of a full blown dal is that it can radically simplify your data for my dal me write things myquery new return end up with the class that i did but hopefully you can see a few the connection string is never an issue in my code is i can run multiple commands without all the set up and tear down usually and the overall syntax is more

have created a dll that will gather information from the in the class constructor i am using reflection to get the application that is class public assembly if assembly to gather needed this is intended to be used is if i call this from any dll in a given that lets say the name will always be retrieving that information is not a problem and it works great in windows services and windows my question is do i get the assembly of the have found a few articles and i can get the information in the by moving the for the website out of the folder and into the root of the then by adding a compileroption to the physical path of the that i am able to retrieve information in the for the website through now i can overload the constructor of my class to accept an and retrieve information that but if another dll that is used by creates a i will get the assembly information of that dll instead of the parent know that if i was working with web apps instead of web sites i have this but for reasons i go into i am not able to use web any suggestions on how i can read information from the of the website running in no matter what dll i need this to work for web windows apps and windows information in the using reflection in a web	
have created a dynamic typing system in c in order to create a dictionary that can contain values of different bit the structure of the dynamic object unsigned char need to compare two of these dynamics that hold a2d readings and then compare the difference against a delta value to determine if a change has one solution i have been able to come up with is to cast them to char arrays and compare them byte by but that smell i also have an idea to make an array of function pointers based on the number of bytes perhaps the the dynamics take up and just make a comparison function for each type can anyone suggest a different it feels like i am missing for telling me about but i still have the problem of how do i get the delta of the two from what i can memcmp just returns an indicator of which value is not the difference between to turns out that memcmp is useless to me because the architecture i am compiling against is little i were going to do a bignum implementation myself then ephemient feels like the right way to but i have decided i am just going to memcpy the values into the largest possible type unsigned long that i will have to deal with and just work the math using i think of any reason why this would not but i recognize that i could be very wrong as c direct memory manipulation is not my two values that have an arbitrary number of bits in

have noticed that numerous on com point out that it is relatively easy to implement an object that can be used as an inner object in com unless i am missing it seems that aggregation can only be successful in extremely limited scenarios and thus support for it should only be provided when such a scenario is specifically part that troubles me is as com aggregation combines an inner identity with that of an outer the implementor of the outer object selects a subset of the inner interfaces and forwards requests for those interfaces to the inner the inner object forwards all requests for interfaces to the outer now suppose that the inner as part of its constructs child com presumably an interface pointer is passed to that com object so it can communicate with its the inner object has some idea of the interfaces that it however the outer object might have chosen not to forward some of those documentation states that an outer object should not blindly forward this seems to imply that the inner object often cannot hand away interface pointers to other com objects unless the outer object is specifically required to forward all of those interfaces to the inner this is not limited to a child object any place where the inner object implementation passes an interface pointer seem like they could be it appears that aggregation is not general purpose cases where the inner object must communicate with other com places strict requirements on the outer object as to which interfaces minimally must be forwarded and more interfaces cannot be added to this list in future versions of the inner object without breaking compatibility with existing outer objects that do not forward those this a correct seldom description of the way things actually are or is there more to the com aggregation not supportable by most

have two questions regarding a how to escape potential apostrophes or any other characters that would cause an not worried about sql how to use in with and include results that have a i seem to find any advice for the first option since every one says use parametrized that a queries which pretty sure you do with the the situation is like i know what the values are going to be ahead of time since the list is retrieved from a i know i could parse the string before passing it to the select but sure there is some ansi built in away of doing it which afraid i aware that two apostrophes in a row would escape the character if i knew where it was going to be located but i know the exact location when i receive now for the actual select what looking to do is allow the user to free form type into a text this text field will use 4 different columns to filter so the user could type in several items separated by space which would then perform a query per their the itunes search box which allows you to type free form album song etc or you could be specific and only search by one type of know how to do an in or a like by themselves but not sure how i could put them together escaping the apostrophes and including results that match but might have a null in one of the and of course do something that is supported by the in like the user in the case above provided lu which should return a record for the more information they provide would further refine the any is the technical specs regarding my expression using in and

i am using yet so i am trying to make simple what is too complex for me managing backing beans with conflicting navigation external params breaking rules and so for example when i need a backing bean used by other simply i call it using facescontext inside other backing but often too wired up to jsf rules to be really and of course more simple is more useful become the with only a bit of cross browser javascript a form copy and a on a i create a sort of proxy form inside the main user page disassociated from jsf navigation but using jsf ajax gives me flexibility on the user but data is always managed by i demand all user actions to an hidden which build up all needed forms according jsf then a javascript simply clone its form output and put it into the user view level for real command buttons and making the user plays around and when he click a script copies all form values into the real jsf form inside the that invokes the real submit of the what it returns is obviously dependent by your jsf is really a pleasure real interest is to know what are your alternative strategy for using pure ajax and jsf without adopting middle layer like ajax4jsf and all good choices but too much than and jsf using hidden iframe with what do you think about this development

i get data in postgresql is and i know i can use to make my queries i know there might even be a type in a future version of my question how do you deal with this when designing user thinking specifically of uniqueness say my data looks more or less like a file system google except that google docs actually allows duplicate names how can i make it easy for our users to understand the fact that they can have duplicate if the case is i think to most it will just seem get some questions out of the come from a windows so is how i i now primarily use mac os which you is the majority of our users fit into these same two new to most of my experience is with but also used which is like i thought a lot of about this issue but ultimately left everything and let our users just figure it interested in both technical solutions making this problem just go and ui design solutions helping the user feel comfortable with the do you deal with case insensitivity when designing user can i make it easy for our users to understand the fact that they can have duplicate if the case is i appreciate all the feedback so if the answer is allow duplicate names if they differ by then do i implement in one solution considered is silently maintaining a separate column which is always the version of the and putting the unique constraint on this do you expose case sensitivity to

i had to agree with your will personally prefer composition to inheritance in about of the but it all depends a little on which programming language in a rich language like practically not be using inheritance at all henceforth also quite few protected a more primitive language like there are so few sensible options to that you basically have to use any means available to so inheritance is overused in java to create working for microsoft or sun and are making the api for or the windows template method be for the rest of the template method pattern borders on being an in my lot of times it uses up your inheritance hierarchy for wrong between subclasses and base classes tend to become classes have a tendency to become littered with all sorts of unrelated forces you to lock down often quite early in the development lock down in a lot of this at a later stage becomes just harder and while by no means being i tend to have very few protected methods in my is the smell of

i have an interesting i am working with a proprietary set of dlls that i have the source the goal is to write an intermediate dll that groups together a large series of funnction calls from the proprietary the problem i am when compiling with is that i get errors for the original dlls along the lines export symbol not i add a main and just compile to an executable everything works as using mingw for thanks for any response to the first either confused about what saying or i word my question very not explicitly trying to export anything from my wrapper i am just calling functions from their the problem is that i get errors that it export these specific symbols from the dll to my the issue is that not even entirely sure what these symbols are i did a search and read somewhere that they be exported because internal symbols that windows i have tried using the directive to the linker but it seem to do i apologize if completely misunderstanding what trying to i think my issue was related to when just compiling a standard executable that uses a dll i was able to include the headers and directly call the functions for a function in the would compile and run i just needed to link the libraries in the linking with the flag i would get these errors main removed of i think it has something to do with the fact that by default attempts to import all symbols from the what i understand is why this happens in the dll vs in an i will try doing it using thank compiling dll that accesses another

i have found myself doing often lately is declaring typedefs relevant to a particular class inside that typedef typedef types are then used elsewhere in the new lorem i like reduces the noise introduced by the class becomes serves as a statement of intent in the example the lorem class is intended to be reference counted via and stored in a allows the implementation to change if lorem needed to be changed to be intrusively reference counted at a later stage then this would have minimal impact to the think it looks and is arguably easier to i like are sometimes issues with dependencies if you want to a within another class but only need to forward declare lorem opposed to introducing a dependency on its header then you end up having to use the explicit types rather than which is a little may not be very and hence harder to try to be objective with my coding so it would be good to get some other opinions on it so i can dissect my thinking a little typedefs in good style or bad

i have undestood what is your real then you need a sort of timer which automatically extends every user session client consequentely overriding the server side default page session expiration timing usually 30 only for detail because i understood that the script every 30 seconds if the user is active on the page so before jsf i always extended inactive user sessions via underground so use it also in your pratically you can build a simple page listener in javascript starting expression msecintervaltiming can be a called function in which you invoke some dummy jsf needed to keep the session alive without reloading the current page visited by the in the past i used standard frame or iframe to make http now with xhr ajax is more simple timerid invoked by some user event denoting his absence here goes all events and logic you need and know for firing the if avoid timerid msecintervaltiming make iframe or make action like page reloading or other invoked by some user event denoting his active it can be also the global variable timerid you use the as a global reference to keep track of the listener so when you need to activate the you assign it a instead when the user come back to the page by some event you you clear the timeout stopping the listener above example obviously implies that the when comes must reload the page in your specifical avoid to interfere with javascript automatically generated by icefaces even for you could simulate periodically some user events on invisible input elements set on not on this causes the icefaces event to not stop it and making itself work like on which you can call periodically invoke the click event by the see the old great js docs of devedge online

i keep hearing that preparedstatements are good for have a java application in which we use the regular more than we use the while trying to move towards using more i am trying to get a more thorough understanding of how preparedstatements work on the client side and the server if we have some typical crud operations and update an object repeatedly in the does it help to use a i understand that we will have to close the ps every time otherwise it will result in a cursor how does it help with does the driver cache the precompiled statement and give me a copy the next time i do or does the db server understand the argument about the security benefits of preparedstatements and i appreciate the answers below which emphasize however i really want to keep this discussion focused on the performance benefits of when i say update i really mean more in terms of that method randomly being called several i understand the advantage in the answer offered below which asks to the statement inside a some code blah some more code blah blah void update throws preparedstatement ps is no way to actually reuse the java object and i understand that the actual call is quite is what brings me back to the original is this preparedstatement still being cached and reused under the covers that i dont know should also mention that we support several in and

i personally would do is to make a script in some scripting language to separate the different data sets before the file is read into and possibly do some of the necessary data you want to do the splitting in look up and is too and is meant for reading a single data you could write the different data sets into different or if you are cook up r objects that are usable with and read from the correct parts of the underlying big you have dealt with separating the data sets into different use on those whichever variant is best if those are not tabs but see if indicates in your be sure to specify it as part of if you do r thinks you have data in that but with the right you automatically get the field converted into it seems that one of your fields can include time stamps like so you need to use and specify a class to which your time stamp format can be if the class just define your own class and an function that does the

i think found what you take a look you must define a webmethod on your server and then you can easily access it using an exellent working example is under the link and here modify it to show how you can pass your page use this class to class public string name public string color this is your in my case partial class public static string return name is on your this is what we want to send to the var dogitem and this is how it should be sent in serialized var dogitemserialized dogitemserialized here you fill textboxes and then your data is sent to the server which understands it as a dog pay attention to arguments because this is the most confusing you should pass them in json which is a little bit so i use here script which helps to convert usual javascript object into string it is available but it is still rather ugly it is important that i pass argument called which value is the serialized because this is exactly what the server expects to get for i change the argument this dogitemserialized the last pay attention to the following you are working with prior to then need to write just instead of only encapsulates all the data under member for some in the above article you can find useful links inside the article and in so you can read more about and so hope this

i understand i think you perhaps are misunderstanding how the module you are already specifying an address of for the server to bind you start the server via your call to this is going to cause the server to start listening to a socket on to the that socket is passed to your requesthandler as the when data is received on the your method should be able to that object using the documented socket you want a further it looks like your requesthandler can extend from streamrequesthandler and to the socket using objects point there is no need for you to create an additional socket and then try to force your server to use the new one part of the value of the socketserver module is that it manages the lifecycle of the socket for the flip if you want to test your server from a then you would want to create a socket that you can your client requests but you would never pass this socket to your per you would probably do this in a completely separate process and test your server via ipc over the based on new get server a to open a socket to server b when server a receives data one solution is to simply open a socket from inside your that there are likely some other design concerns that you will need to address based on the requirements of your you may want to use a simple connection pool that say opens a few sockets to server b that server a can use like a there may already be some libraries in python that help with your current your requesthandler has access to the server as a member variable so you could do something like def point socketb hold serverb def data if print do whatever with the like i it may be better for you to have some sort of connection pool or other object that manages your server b socket such that your server a handler can just the socket as incoming requests are way you can better deal with conditions where server b breaks the your current design be able to handle broken sockets very just some	
i understand indexing scheme when the same long string is indexed as a field in many this really bulk out the index compared to if it were indexed just i create a single term make it and then add it to many does the full string data get duplicated for each document in the if this is the am i just best off putting the actual storage of the into far as i can the only info that comes back in query results is the documents themselves ordered by to determine which fields satisfied the query for a matched must i do separate queries on the fields for each or lucene stores a dictionary mapping strings to numerical so the memory consumed is only to store the identifier several think you are safe storing the tags and attributes in do not need separate queries once you hold a document you can use to get the relevant field you are concerned about lucene i suggest you read lucene and which covers lots of performance

i understand the open session in view pattern need not necessarily mean a unit of work is open for the entirety of the i handle this not webforms but the principle is the by explicitly defining a unit of work in my controller before the controller method returns any database transaction has been so i can handle any data update errors properly at that the session stays open even after the transaction has been for my the open session in view is useful mainly to allow lazy loading of related objects in the view there were 2 main reasons i chose to do it this want to hold any database transactions open while the view is being rendered to the response not and with database the shorter the a having an explicit unit of work is not much extra nhibernate errors that occur in the view stage are less important for me the and any updates have already gone so i can just handle those with a generic redirect error

i understand the problem you want to keep the html but you want to not count it as part of the length of the string you are can accomplish this with code that implements a simple state goes to outoftag if character is goes to itself any other character is goes to intag if character is goes to itself any other character is starting state will be implement a finite state machine by procesing 1 character at a the processing of each character brings you to a new you run your text through the finite state you want to also keep an output buffer and a length so far encountered varaible you know when to your length variable each time you are in the state outoftag and you process another you can optionally not increment this variable if you have a whitespace end the algorithm when you have no more characters or you have the desired length mentioned in your output include characters you encounter up until the length mentioned in a stack of unclosed when you reach the for each element in the add an end as you run through your algorithm you can know when you encounter a tag by keeping a this variable is started when you enter the intag and it is ended when you enter the outoftag state when a whitepsace character is encountered while in the intag if you have a start tag you put it in the if you have an end you pop it from the

i was in i took several courses that encouraged the adoption and use of agile they were mostly a mess and although i learned a lot of from them they generally the things the professor was expecting us to i do agile development professionally now and love but here are the things i wish that i had known when i was doing agile in things squared with your schedule is really which makes daily standups more not if you sit in the same room then use twitter or yammer or just lot of benefit is simply in getting you into a that just mean weekly it means set commitment to and weekly this is tough to pull off in an academic context but should go a way towards helping you with your procrastination tough to get used to everyone has their own computer and style of try to hook a second up to your existing laptops if or use screen sharing and standardize on an pairing also really helps with procrastination but trying to do it without good tools is an awful lot of skimp on unit even if you think of it as a done projects before that i figured were too small to bother with testing and never failed to come back and bite me on the might be a bit believe it or we still do an awful lot of things on whiteboards or with index you may be your own customer but that mean you have stories estimable and helpful to be able to visualize these features are these are in these are ready for if like software recommendations i can give you those but i do recommend simple paper for a lot of the planning

i work for a company that makes performance management and capacity a lot of products out there to answer those quest makes a like spotlight for sql spotlight for capacity manager for sql and so no single formula or rule of thumb because each component in the system reacts differently to and each thing storing scales if storing sales data in a data your sales data will grow pretty a simple formula per per you first open your the transactions per day is fairly but as word spreads about your the transactions per day if you start carrying more items amazon going from books to your items per transaction may rise as well but not over as your reporting needs implement aggregate tables to include data about your etc and change the amount of data you store as the other if building a web filtering the formula revolves around the number of employees each company people will surf roughly the same amount over but the formula is affected by whether going to hire more people or lay people you nail down a formula to predict your data that formula necessarily useful to your cpu needs or your bandwidth a each capacity planning product has its own sets of for has something like half a dozen different formulas just to predict disk and not even talking about cpu or memory in a big find that different formulas work better for different types of found that more efficient to buy a product that has all these formulas built in rather than reinvent the wheel to become an expert in predictive i expect me to say that because i work for a but i bought capacity manager as a dba before i came to work for

ia a very broad are you looking to write your own or just a simple application can do that with erb quite biggest pitfall i can see to not using a framework one that is that it will be much harder for other people to figure out what your code is and you lose all the automated data document and other goodies that frameworks tie if you do all the just written a written a horrible mess of spaghetti since a beginning is read the rails and try and figure out what it not because necessarily a great but because your understanding of web frameworks will be a lot more complete by diving into a and this is very looked at a few of your other and it looks like a so going to caution you against writing your own not because a bad idea per but because of what a software framework represents the sum total of years of experience in working with language are like beavers we want to we want to to build always with the idea of fixing the shortcomings of the existing while this is a very noble it tends to lead people down the path of getting very little because they willing to use tools that other people have often for what boil down to cosmetic younger coders are especially guilty of and i was no different i wasted literally years screwing around with writing webservers and database abstraction instead of writing software that i could have made money i could go back and do things i would have started contributing to the frameworks that already rather than just trying to it from there is an exception to that rule of other work and that is when got the experience with the tools to know when time to build something dhh guy who started was a very ruby coder before he decided to write a ruby probably at reading what other people have cooked and rather than just starting on your learn more about the make a valuable contribution to the and give yourself some good resume

idea of a linear index for arrays in matlab is an important an array in matlab is really just a vector of strung out in matlab allows you to use either a row and column or a single linear for 8 1 3 5 4 9 can see the order the elements are stored in memory by unrolling the array into a you can the 8th element is the number in the function find returns its results as a linear result we can access each element in turn of a general array using a single for if we wanted to square the elements of a i know there are better ways to do one might do i 64 1 9 25 16 81 are many circumstances where the linear index is more conversion between the linear index and two dimensional subscripts is accomplished with the sub2ind and ind2sub linear index applies in general to any array in so you can use it on cell the only problem with the linear index is when they get too matlab uses a 32 bit integer to store these so if your array has more then a total of elements in the linear index will it is really only an issue if you use sparse matrices when occasionally this will cause a i use a 64 bit matlab i believe that problem has been resolved for those lucky individuals who

implemented a couple of systems that mimiced what olap cubes and here are a couple of things we did to get them to the core data was held in a n dimensional all in and all the keys were implemented via hierarchies of pointers to the underlying in this way we could have multiple different sets of keys for the same the data in the array was the equivalent of the fact often it would only have a couple of pieces of in one instance this was price and number the underlying array was often so once it was created we used to remove all the blank cells to save memory lots of hard core pointer arithmetic but it as we had heirarchies of we could write routines quite easily to drill a hierarchy for instance we would access year of by going through the months which in turn mapped to days at each level we would aggregate data as part of building the cube made calculations much we implement any kind of query but we did support drill down on all axis 7 in our biggest and that was tied directly to the ui which the users we implemented core stuff in but these days i reckon could be fast but worry about how to implement sparse that sound

imply a lot of linux file systems delay writes and batch them which improves overall presumably reduces wear on the disk and improves battery life for if the os had to write to disk whenever a file many of these benefits would be tomblin mentioned a controversy in his and explaining the one seen fit into a what recent controversy is over the ext4 ordering is the proposed successor to the popular ext3 linux file it is in linux and unix to change important files by reading the old writing out the new one with a different and renaming the new one to the old the idea is to ensure that either the new one or the old one will be even if the system fails at some ext4 appears to be happy to read the old rename the new one to the old and write the new which can be a real problem if the system goes down between steps 2 and standard way to deal with this is of course but that trashes the real solution is to modify ext4 to keep the ext3 where it rename a file until it had finished writing it apparently this covered by the so a quality of implementation and qoi is really lousy there being no way to reliably write a new version of configuration files without constantly calling with all the problems that or risking losing both

important difference between and is not will only accept a string but will accept if the operand is an it will be converted to a string by calling on a primitive will be converted as if by calling the appropriate method in the associated wrapper and a null reference becomes the string i know why even people see it listed in the api docs and assume there for a good being the most obvious but a red if performance is really a you should be using a as discussed in the thread john linked or is much more as for the issue of objects in the string i think misunderstanding what the string pool at the actual character and will be stored in a dedicated data and wherever you see the literals and in the source the bytecode will really contain references to the appropriate entries in that data the string pool is populated when the classes are not when the code containing the string literals is that means each of your snippets only creates one the result of the also some object creation behind the which is a little different for each of the but the performance impact is not worth worrying

intel platform the explanation is the when you declare on stack the compiler really allocates 8 bytes because of then typical for functions to have the following saves ebp registry value on then moves esp register value into ebp for using esp value to access the this leads to 4 more bytes on stack to be occupied with ebp the epilogue ebp is but its value is usually only used for accessing function so overwriting it may not hurt in most you have the following layout grows downwards on 8 bytes for your then 4 bytes for then usually the return is why you need to overwrite at least 13 bytes to crash your

is a pretty standard design and there really a true rule of thumb i typically follow is goes in files go in of the considerations to keep in a file is stored in the how are you going to serve it out via you need to set the content if a file on the the web server takes care of all that stuff for very quickly and efficiently even in kernel no interpreted code are typically big databases are certainly but they are slow and inconvenient to back up why make your database huge when you have like really easy to copy files to multiple say running a you can just periodically rsync the filesystem from your master machine to your slaves and use standard static http obviously databases can be clustered as just not necessarily as the flip side of if already clustering your then having to deal with clustered files in addition is administrative this would be a reason to consider storing files in the data in databases is typically you filter sort by or group by that lessens the value of storing it in the the flip databases understand you can use your standard model of transaction isolation to ensure that two clients try to edit the same file at the same this might be not to say you use but now got two things to understand instead of files in a filesystem can be opened with regular whatever you this can be how are you gonna open that word document out of a blob filesystems have and they can be a pain in the they might be useful to your permissions will really bite you if taking advantage of because almost guaranteed that your web server runs with different permissions than your sarah mei this plays into the http question above on the client side you going to remember to set lifetimes on the server side files on a filesystem are a very and optimized access large blob fields may or may not be optimized well by your and almost guaranteed to have an additional network trip from the database to the web server as people tend to use filesystems for files because they support idioms the no reason you have to do it and filesystems are becoming more and more like databases so it surprise me at all to see a complete convergence

is code which includes a variadic function and calls to the variadic i would expect that it would output each sequence of numbers it does when compiled as a but not when compiled as a void argument for i val return is the output when compiled for argument argument argument argument argument note that the reason the variadic function pulls out is because the use of this is for a variadic function that accepts a list of pointers and naturally the length argument should be a and in some cases a caller might pass in a length for for i const ptr const len that the passed into might encounter the problem described and really the caller should be using or the result of or just plain put the number into a but the point is that the compiler is not catching this common danger with variadic right thing to do here is to eliminate the variadic function and replace it with a better mechanism that provides type i would like to document this and collect more detailed information as to exactly why this problem exists on this platform and manifests as it does this variadic function fail on 4th parameter on windows

is definitely the operating system can fetch from the disk to the cache while your code is processing the data already the disk may well still be the bottleneck but you have but for suppose we have processing which takes half the time of representing time going down the we might have this sort of activity without with this is optimised the total time will be to read whole file time to process last piece of instead of to read whole file time to process whole it is tricky need to have an operating system where you can tweak or turn off the another alternative is to change how opening the file for in if you open the file with the cache is more likely to do the right try with and without that has spoken mostly about prefetching general caching the data even after been delivered to the is a different and obviously acts as a big win if you want to use the same data more than also in where the application has only requested a small amount of but the disk has read a whole block the os actively prefetching blocks which been but can cache the whole block so that if the app then requests more data from the same block it can return that data from the

is in sqlite so been trying to see if there are any performance improvements gained by using sqlite disk based basically like to trade startup time and memory to get extremely rapid queries which do hit disk during the course of the the following benchmark gives me only a factor of in improved generating 1m rows of random data and loading it into both a disk and memory based version of the same i then run random queries on both returning sets of size approx i expected the memory based version to be considerably but as mentioned only getting experimented with several other sizes of dbs and query the advantage of seem to go up as the number of rows in the db not sure why the advantage is so though i had a few table used big enough to make a huge would make the advantage more is some kind of caching going on at the connection or os level such that the previous results are accessible corrupting the is some kind of hidden disk access going on that not seeing tried lsof but i did turn off the pragmas for i doing something wrong any thoughts on why producing nearly instant the to see whether offers significant performance numpy as c to avoid hitting trading safety for make a demo table if not exists demo id2 val index on demo index on demo for row in into demo start foo diff return build some fake data with 3 1000000 700 uniques in 1st 5000 uniques in 2nd load it into both dbs build execute a series of random queries and see how long it takes each of 300000 number of ids of each qq in qsize id1a uniqueness of ids id2a id1s for xx in id2s for xx in query from demo where id1 in and id2 in now look at the disk memory row in print the note that disk takes about as long as memory for a fairly wide range of query disk memory ram be almost instant relative to going wrong good suggestions guess the main takehome point for me is that probably no way to make but there is a way to make disk access other the benchmark is adequately measuring the realistic performance of but not the realistic performance of disk because the pragma is too big or because not doing mess around with those parameters and post my findings when i get a if there is anyone who thinks i can squeeze some more speed out of the db than by jacking up the and which i will all performance benchmark why is so as fast as

is no memory leak but you should use instead of especially since your function is you ever want to to use a type which has a your malloc based function is broken since it call any replace with simply doing double new stuff with is functionally equivalent it can call constructors for other it is simpler and requires less plus every programmer will instantly know what is going on since it involve an extra use smart pointers to completely avoid memory stuff with many smart programmers like to say best code is the code you have to why do you believe that the code you posted leaks i saw your comment to another post saying code execution command top allocated memory may be completely normal may not depending on your allocation usually the way heaps work is that they often but often shrink is to favor subsequent completely symmetric allocations and frees should allow the application to stabilize at a certain amount of result in continuous growth because the heap is highly likely to give the same block for each my question to you does it grow or does it simply not have asked what to do about a 2d i would use a class to wrap the either use a library believe boost has a array or rolling your own be too something like this may be goes like is technically more efficient to use something like for indexing a matrix wrapper but in this case i chose to simulate native array if efficiency is it can be made as efficient as native another what platform are you developing if it is then i would recommend valgrind to help pinpoint your memory since the code provided is clearly not the know of but i am sure that windows also has memory profiling for a matrix if you insist on using plain old why not just allocate it as a single contiguous block and do simple math on indexing like p new to access an just do width way you do a on the pointer whether it is a 1d or 2d

is no of doing this in only various accepted and many mediocre and just plain bad php gives you a nice open space to do it however it makes sense to this is arguably its greatest but this is also a big just because you do it however you like mean you seen numerous projects that do it all different the methods currently involve separating out data data access and data presentation using a framework usually with a central dispatch they have their own rules about how to arrange your directories and where to find the older method involved treating each file as a it had a few at the top of the file that setup the including database handlers and other but also defined functions for building the common elements of a the file was in two it did all its processing and access in the first and then built its output in the second a variation of that has it include a separate file for the this is closer to the spirit of php and is easier to make work from	
is no option to specify the order of operations in a transaction as it is as follows the sql statements are issued in the following entity in the same order the corresponding objects were saved using entity collection collection element updates and collection entity in the same order the corresponding objects were deleted using exception is that objects using native id generation are inserted when they are can i challenge you to answer you are adding a new entity with an existing an identifier is supposed to be unique to a specific if that entity is so should be its option would be to do an update on that record instead of a this keeps the id the same so there is no unique constraint violation the key at and you can change all the other data so that a apparently i entirely paying attention to the question when i responded since this is a problem with a unique constraint on a think you have two solutions to choose after your delete which will execute all the changes to the session up to that after which you can continue with the rest your new this works inside of a transaction as well so you need to worry about a function which updates the existing entity with new data but keeps the and the unique column the

is not an iterator like in and itself is actually a really simple concept once you understand how blocks work in blocks are a functional programming even though ruby is not properly a functional in ruby uses the method to create block which is borrowed from syntax for creating anonymous functions which is what blocks from a computer science blocks lambda are in methods usually take only one can pass but keyword in ruby is just a way of calling a block been given to a these two examples are output yield calling our block here with puts value is the tells ruby to convert an object without calling output explicitly calling the block puts value is the first just assuming a block and say to call in the ruby wraps the block in an object and passes it as an the first is more efficient and but effectively the call either one like a a it would print the value that wound up getting assigned to so a completely stupid but i think you get the are used for a lot of things in almost every place use a loop in a language like replaced in ruby with methods that take for print prints returns value 2 returns andrew also commonly used for opening files and many other basically anytime you have a standard function that could use some custom logic sorting an array or processing a use a there are other uses but this answer is already so long afraid it will cause heart attacks in readers with weaker hopefully this clears up the confusion on this

is nothing new or the just talking about native been able to do plugins for the only special thing about is that it allows native code and to talk to each other in a plugin and the little trick where dll can be seen as a singleton object that implements the interface you can use the supports function from the unit to check if the dll and all the methods are you want to do what the talking about in delphi for look at the getprocaddress and freelibrary windows api if you absolutely must have an interface like the article you have to write it either in the dll you wrote the dll by writing an exported function that returns an or in the calling by writing a function that uses getprocaddress to create an interface this requires mucking around with and is usually more trouble than best bet is probably just to do what tim sullivan use tjvpluginmanager from the if you only need native or if you have to talk to

is really intended as a web server as a framework that fits into a web not as an email i suppose you could put some code into a django web application that starts up an email using the kind of code shown in that question you linked but i really recommend an abuse of the capabilities of dynamic web normal practice is to have separate email and web and for that you would want to look into something like sendmail or for pop3 you would also need something like dovecot or i certainly possible to have the email server notify your web application when emails are received so it can act on if what you want to in response to your yes you are trying to make at least an email an email server is just a program that receives emails may be capable of sending them as but you need could definitely write a small email server in python that just receives these emails and saves the images to the filesystem or a database or be worth asking a new but make it part of your django web keep it as its own separate

is right that immutability would fix but that would also be you could just lock the whole thing but that could be a performance i can think of two good is to use a requires or since your checkpoint can acquire the read lock it can be assured things are but when no one is reading performance should be pretty this is still a pretty coarse so you may also want to do is to break things each area of the program could keep own map map for gui the map for user the map for hardware each one would have a lock on it and things would go about as when it came time to the checkpointer would grab all the locks things are and then do the catch here is you have define an order for the locks to be grabbed in otherwise with the maps are orthogonal to each other to one require updates to another to be then the easiest thing may be to push the updates to a central map in the not unlike something you biggest question to you would how much of a problem is this are updates very or are they that would help to advise on something since my last idea could be but easy and may not is a fantastic book called concurrency in which is basically the java threading it discusses how to figure out this kind of stuff and strategies to avoid problems or make solving them if you are going to be doing more a very useful if your key values are orthogonal to then things are really the interface are implemetations such as the would solve your problems since they can do changes so readers see inconsistent but if you have any two keys that must be updated at the same time this cover hope this threading access to shared data structures is complex

is the facilitator for operating on asynchronous once a async operation is it uses one of running threads to call you if no such thread exists it uses own internal thread to call of it as a queue containing it garantees you that those when will only do so on the threads that called its or or when dealing with sockets and async internal reason you must pass it to everyone is basically that someone has to wait for async operations to be an as stated in own documentation is link to the operating system service so it abstracts away the own async such as and the methods to operate on such as i end up using to demultiplex callbacks from several parts of the and make sure they operate on the same eliminating the need for explicit since the operations are it is a very powerful idiom for asynchronous can take a look at the to get a better feeling of why is needed and what it

is the kind of behaviour that is often seen in event driven gui frameworks when one wants to do continuous going to guess that is called from a button click or maybe from some point during the application startup in any here is going uses the main application thread to drive an event the event loop is something like problem you are seeing is that updates to the screen are done during a paint if you are running some code during a mouse click event or any other then all the drawing you are doing is queued up and will be drawn to the screen on the next paint sometimes it takes awhile for this to sink best way to address this is to change your approach a one way is to throw away your while loop and setup a qtimer set to fire every 5 in the timer slot you can draw one when the timer fires draw the next you want a more direct and less elegant quick try calling right after your call to this of the will force the application to clear out any queued up events which should include paint should also mention that is merely adding new scene objects to the scene on each iteration covering the ones that were added during the last think of the scene as a fridge door and when you call you are throwing more fridge magnets on the door

is what successfully worked for my team in the combo of face to face and email code 10 1 big 1 all based physically in same based upon the principal that no one developer owns their own they may be responsible for coding it in the first place but may not be responsible for bug fixing code review process was made easier with visual studio team we could shelve our code and someone else could unshelve the code to review it without having to actually commit the code into the development review we provided a high level over view of how to solve a no code at this talk with fellow developer who is available and development benefits of early design review is getting input that a single developer might have etc if to code changes to another developer for peer review via best bet is to submit it to a developer who was not involved with design note that the reviewer should review the code without input from the original this is we approach it this way for several the code can be understood by someone who has not written it then it is safe to say it is maintainable should the original developer be no longer around to ask the company or or even if they are still the code reviewer cant understand the code then its given back to the developer and makes it more understandable either by greater documentation or refactoring the it could be as simple as adding more information to the bug description that the code change is related this in it self saves so much time in the ability to pick up someone elses code and understand it quickly is very and code reviewer get together and discuss makes changes if reviews in my opinion and very important and advantageous to the development you learn from reading other peoples your skill in reading other peoples code you learn about other areas of a system you are another head with knowledge of how something works therefore another resource to code in that area if its spreading the not easy to sit and listen to someone point out flaws in your code which naturally points people away from code

it be simpler to simply create a separate thread with its own message queue for your i think casyncsocket needs to be created on the main message just some message see the documentation for cwinthread to see how to create a separate thread with its own message it is crucial that you call all socket operations from the context of the new mfc uses global state in hidden classes that use storage to hold and that information is used in many of the that means casynchsocket has thread affinity and you must always use and create it in whatever thread is to be its message approach would be to create a create your own custom mfc hidden window on that thread creating the window in the context of that and create messages and message handlers on that window for all of the socket operations you assure that the thread is pumping messages method does and then messages to your window to control your remember that callbacks from your socket will come in on a separate thread than your ui or worker need to worry about race conditions and possibly gui thread affinity issues if updating gui worried about the design just create your own cthreadsafeasynchsocket proxy object and delegate to the real implementation through to your hidden you can use sendmessage for blocking operations and postmessage for asynchronous if you wrap the constructor in a factory you can delay creation of the socket thread until its last concern i can think of is that need to detect when all your proxies have gone away and shut down the you can use a global reference count managed by the to detect when to shut down the failing to shut down the thread will keep your app hanging about with a hidden window even after you close your main app

it is a absolute value not a calculating the square root is probably one of the worst things you could do accept a smart compiler optimizes it away because it is really there is a library function for doing something like multiplying with is also just return so a good solution would be the x compiler will probably optimize this to a single ifs may be quite expensive on moden processors because of the long execution their calculations must be thrown away if a branch was misspredicted and the processor started executing the instructions from the wrong code but because of the mentioned compiler optimization you need not care in this

it is true that is a good do not forget that a application entails other issues you will have to deal matter what scm you end up in order to divide your application into more manageable and independent one your scm need to deal with while this is especially true in maintenance when you have both a release in production to and a new development for the next version to in order to easily query your deliveries into a test homologation production the merge perforce or git are better than because they allow you to merge any subtree you while memorizing the merge and with many merging strategies in its latest subversion does only support from the root directory of a can merge but the will not be accurate for merges to subtree the ones you have currently checked	
it is worth worrying about in md5 is so badly broken that have been able to forge fake certificates that matched a real certificate signed by a certificate this meant that they were able to create their own fake certificate and thus could impersonate any bank or business they felt like with browsers completely trusting this took them a lot of time and effort using a cluster of playstation and several weeks to find an appropriate but once a hash algorithm only gets never if you care at all about it would be better to choose an unbroken hash such as one of the has also been though not broken as badly as md5 the technique used in the link that i provided you involved being able to choose two arbitrary message prefixes and a common from which it could generate for each prefix a block of data that could be inserted between that prefix and the common to produce a message with the same md5 sum as the message constructed from the other i cannot think of a way in which this particular vulnerability could be exploited in the situation you and in using a secure has for is more resistant to attack than using it for digital but i can think of a few vulnerabilities you need to watch out which are mostly independent of the hash you your algorithm involves storing the password in plain text on the this means that you are vulnerable to any information disclosure attacks that may be able to discover passwords on the you may think that if an attacker can access your database then the game is but your users would probably prefer if even if your server is that their passwords not because of the proliferation of passwords many users use the same or similar passwords across information disclosure attacks may be possible even in cases when code execution or privilege escalation attacks are can mitigate this attack by storing the password on your server hashed with a random you store the pair on the and send the salt to the client so that it can compute to use in place of the password in the protocol you this does not protect you from the next an attacker can sniff a message sent from the he can do an offline dictionary attack against the most users have passwords with fairly low and a good dictionary of a few hundred thousand existing passwords plus some time randomly permuting them could make finding a password given the information an attacker has from sniffing a message pretty technique you propose does not authenticate the i know if this is a web app that you are talking but if it then someone who can perform a dns hijack or dhcp hijacking on an unsecure wireless or anything of the can just do a attack in which they collect passwords in clear text from your the current attack against md5 may not work against the protocol you md5 has been severely and a hash will only ever get never do you want to bet that you will find out about new attacks that could be used against you and will have time to upgrade hash algorithms before your attackers have a chance to exploit it would probably be easier to start with something that is currently stronger than to reduce your chances of having to deal with md5 being broken if just doing this to make sure no one forges a message from another user on a forum or then unlikely that anyone will put the time and effort in to break the protocol that you if someone really wanted to impersonate someone they could probably just create a new user name that has a 0 in place of a o or something even more similar using and not even bother with trying to forge message and break hash this is being used for something where the security really then invent your own authentication just use one of the fundamental rules of cryptography is to invent your and then even for the case of the forum where it probably matter all that it be easier to just use something proven off the shelf than rolling your

java and avoid separate they make full use of they differ is that they require the programmer to write a pair of separate files when writing a reusable the user writes the definition of a class and the compiler extracts the information equivalent to the from that single definition and includes it in the output file as so the output file full of files in or an assembly in is a combination of binaries and headers in a single when another class is compiled and it depends on the first it can look at the metadata instead of having to find a separate include happens that they target a virtual machine rather than a specific chip but a separate they could put x86 machine code in as the binary and still have the metadata in the same file as well is in fact an option in albeit rarely compilers it is common to try to speed up compilation by using the metadata in and files is much like a header already parsed and ready for rapid upshot is that in these modern there is one way of doing and it has the characteristics of a perfectly organised and modular build system pretty speaking

just one read quite a few books and yet to see anyone else saying use personally think properties are one of the best things about they allow you to expose state via whatever mechanism you you can lazily instantiate the first time something is used and you can do validation on setting a value when using and writing i just think of properties as setters and getters which a much nicer for the caveats with there are a one is probably a misuse of the other can be properties are types of it can be surprising if you place complicated logic in a property because most users of a class will expect the property to be fairly class explicitly obvious that calculation is being done public int return class not at all looks like it may just be returning a cached public int get return find that using methods for these cases helps to make a and more properties can have if you evaluate them while you have some property like int result get return suppose you have an exception that occurs when too many queries are guess what happens when you start debugging and rollover the property in the bad avoid doing looking at the property changes the state of the are the only caveats i i think the benefits of properties far outweigh the

just setup a new windows server 2008 machine with an instance of sql server 2008 the sql browser service does not appear to be working in management browsing for servers shows the hostname of the new but not the instance when you choose the hostname form the list it but i can connect manually by typing the browser service is and i have tried it with several different including domain administrator which is a bad but i tried anyway for troubleshooting have tried punching the appropriate holes in the and also completely turning the firewall is running on a windows server 2008 32 bit which is on a windows server 2008 i have done this before on this same but with sql 2008 standard instead of i browse for the server in on the sql server it works fine and shows the whole instance when i browse for it on a remote machine the same with ssms it just shows the host the packets as suggested and found the client sent the broadcast as expected and received correct responses from other sql servers on the same server received the broadcast but did not send a these i wonder why the host name ever appears in the client list in the first it show up at an hour and a half on the phone with microsoft i learned a few but the problem is not yet it was suggested that i try installing an instance of sql standard on the same i did that and the new instance exhibits all the same the hostname shows up in the browse list only not once for each chose an answer for me thanks to the bounty but this question is not today i tried moving the whole vm to a different host server everything is exactly the the hostname still appears in the browse without the instance that integration services are installed on the guest server browser showing only not instance

key thing to realize here is that you have to use just you can use two one you already have which is drawn on hidden map which drawn but which is used for path collision detection natural next question then is where does this second map come you create your own tool which can load your first and display your tool will then let you draw boundaries around you islands and place markers at your these markers and boundaries polygons are stored as your second map and is used in your code to do path finding fact you can have your tool emit python code which creates the graphs and polygons so that you have to load any data am just basically telling you to make a level it very hard to you just need some buttons to click on to define what you are if you are adding a then you can just add each mouse coordinate to an array each time you click on your mouse if you have toggled your add polygon you can have another button for adding cities so that each time you click on the map you will record that coordinate for the city and possibly a corresponding name that you can provide in a text

kind of depends on how you want to set things definitely the portion of the manual on processes is worth reading the code for package is a good place to listed a pretty limited set of functionality like to which could be solved by a direct you can find helpful utility functions by looking at what is provided in the application trying to connect to has an interpreted connect to as opposed to writing a custom parser on the app emacs from launching emacs from the app opposed to the other way might have made this job this is what probably little perl script to open a socket and to up loop in the interpreter write a custom and connect it to a emacs with function call or specifying the the perl script as a subprocess and the port how or do that anything from emacs could be sent to the perl subprocess and be passed on to your and have the desired effect you can send commands back to emacs by just sending over and have them parsed by functions stuck in then write two little one in your app interpreted and one in to do whatever functionality makes the emacs library should probably be packaged as a major mode depending on what the files are if solely to be used with the a major if a minor mode would be better given that probably want to leverage the write the little perl script in as opposed to simply i know how to interact with if the little perl script could be replaced with a chunk of and still have the benefit using be an added got pretty much the same setup for only the connection stuff is handled by send it works really app from if you launch the app from the above still only you can get rid of the little perl script and just interact through the no sockets still need the loop the app leave tied to the libraries would remain the be much but only works if the user flow enables you to go that a hunch writing this for more than just your being it might be easier to this way from you could add on the socket communication later as an whichever is more

kind of simplified it a little too also comes into play when using as explained in java can only hold object so you have to box primitive values into the appropriate wrapper when you take the object out of the you get the integer that you put if you need an you must unbox the integer using the intvalue all of this boxing and unboxing is a and clutters up your the autoboxing and unboxing feature automates the eliminating the pain and the when should you use autoboxing and use them only when there is an between reference types and for when you have to put numerical values into a it is not appropriate to use autoboxing and unboxing for scientific or other numerical an integer is not a substitute for an autoboxing and unboxing blur the distinction between primitive types and reference but they do not eliminate overview of

know how you would inject javascript into someone which would then send you that actually sounds like something a virus would think you could accomplish something like what you want using an simple method would be to include an iframe preset to load the location on your and then include a button on the outer page for the user to post back their current location the the button on your page is pressed you could query the current state of the to the window generated by the iframe and to the document loaded into the iframe can be obtained via the frames array using the name frames array method of referencing has broad even among quite old as long as you attach a name attribute to the for best use both name and more the document inside the iframe can also be referenced via contentwindow and contentdocument properties of the iframe dom as the comments below it looks like most browsers prevent you from using an iframe this you can start a window anwhere you but you are not allowed to communicate with it if it is not on your same i guess you could build a in the where you flow all the trafic through your server but that is not very is a good example of jquery controlling an that	
know i am not the only one who does not like progress bars or time estimates which give unrealistic estimates in best examples are installers which jump from to in 10 seconds and then take an hour to complete the final of the time programmers just estimate the steps to complete a task and then display as a ignoring the fact that each step might take a different time to for if you insert rows into a the insertion time can increase with the number of inserted rows or the time to copy files does not only depend on the size of the file but also on the location on the disk and how fragmented it i asked myself if anybody already tried to model this and maybe created a with a configurable robust i know that it is difficult to give robust estimates because external factors user runs other play their there is also a solution that uses profiling to set up a better or one could use machine learning anybody know of advanced solutions for this connection to i found the article the progress very it shows how progress bars can change the perception of time and how you can use those insights to create progress bars that seem to be can think of ways how to manually tune the time and even with a i will have to fine tune the but i think this problem could be tackled with statistical of the estimator would collect data during the process to create better estimates for the next i do now is to take the average time something took in the previous step grouped by type and normalized by file size of and take this average as estimate for the next steps counting in different types and i know are better statistical to create estimators and i wonder if anybody applied those to the time estimates for progress bars

know the world needs another like it needs a hole in the but writing your own framework is a great way of learning a i wrote a fairly complete one in php in under a fortnight and learned a hell of a lot about php and web development in the only reason i released it is because i was finally not happy with the way it managed session but that was a good learning experience think the way to begin framework design is to write down about 5 basic aims for for these at producing simple web apps with a dozen or so at people with a good knowledge of procedural code php or otherwise for that in sql programming described in on a vanilla state maintenance on was enough to get me other suggestion i can make is to try to build an app using the framewark at the same time as you build the framework this will quickly reveal problems and suggest ideas for new directions abd

law of demeter should be the suggestion of says that you an object to get at their child if as a need to perform some most of the time the domain model working with should support that is in principle a dumb hierarchy of it is like a filesystem of where each object could have child you almost always reach through with you can optionally build up composite object types using rest and as long as the provider and the client agree on you can avoid the how do you balance rest and it seems to me that they are not in because rest is all about coupling to the point where it is pointless for the provider to try to anticipate all the needs of the whereas demeter assumes that logic can migrate to its most natural place through you could argue that rest is just a until you understand your clients is rest just a is demeter unrealistic in any of demeter

less than but a generatedconstructor var params for i i i var code new methodname var ctor new function return way this works should be pretty it creates a function through code this example has a fixed number of parameters for each constructor you but useful most of the time you have atleast a maximum number of arguments in this also is better than some of the other examples here because it allows you to generate the code once and then the code generated takes advantage of the feature of this way you can avoid having to name each parameter spell them out in a list and pass the arguments in to the function you a working dateconstructor new 23 will return the apr 23 1982 is indeed bit but it atleast conveniently hides the mess and assume that compiled code itself can get garbage collected that may depend on the implementation and is a likely area for scott s s

like a bit confused about classes and the thing is one of the gotchas in python for people coming from other programming imo the official tutorial handle it too seems quite ever learnt in python is very similar to in the difference is that python requires you to list as the first argument to every function in a class python is your first programming language your first you could remember this as a simple if defining a function part of a you need to include as the first if defining a function not part of a you include in the you take a class function and make it without doing some possibly a lot extra never include as an argument when a are exceptions to those but not worth worrying about

lists are often implemented using arrays which makes them very fast and by their nature do not require dynamic you just need a quick check on the read and the write indexes to see if they fell off the end and if reset it to zero they are generally used for things like input where the data has no real value once contact lists have lasting value and new contacts will overwrite older contacts once the list fills which might be ok unless you overwrite your grandmom who is leaving you a bunch of cash in her do not think that a linked list is the most efficient way to go for a circular buffer original purpose of a circular buffer is speed and an array simply cannot be beaten for speed in the context of a circular even if you keep a pointer to your last accessed linked list an array will still be more lists have dynamic resizing capabilities that are unneeded for circular said i think a circular buffer is probably not the right structure for the application you

may be able to improve matters by building your list of keywords as a regular may allow them to be tested in but will very much depend on what the keywords are some work may be reused testing for and rather than searching every phrase from the start for each could do this by will actually return a match object on and none if not found this might be useful if you need to know which keyword how much this gains you will depend on the if you only have one or keep your current if you have a large it may be worth tring and profiling to see which performs how the approaches do for your good1 good2 good3 bad1 for this your approach performs far better than the regex whether this will always be the case depends a lot on the number and complexity of and the input data that will be for large numbers of and lengthy lists or rarely matching regexes may work but get timing and perhaps try even simpler optimisations moving the most common words to the front of your keyword sometimes the simplest approach really is the updated the table with and a similar approach before applying the i also added 2 new 500 1000 the first of which 500 1000 none of which show up the various strengths and joining does do worse when a match would immediately be found there is an always cost in joining the list this is a best possible case for the linear search however for it performs better when there are a large number of items in the

may find some helpful code on my tutorial although the i wrote to support this uses stl in should be easy to strip the stl support in addition there is a pool allocator included with it that i wrote to speed up stl on game it is but i ported it originally from c and i think it would be hard to do it the other the code is tested by over people so a good base to start the stl structures using is no problem since it is limited to i use one of the vectors as a priority queue using the heap functions and you can replace that with my c which has a priority queue implemented in c that should just drop into your only does one so you can replace that with a pointer to a reserved area of your you can see in this code fragment from the the main difference in c code is that no this no so your code typically takes an object pointer as the first pqueue int32 uint32 bool32 bisascending pqueue pqueue void uint32 void pqueue pqueue pqueue uint32 void

maybe it would make sense put the code in but there a way to put a handler at which i can close database issue is that you can never rely on these events to because the runtime decides whether they are fired or because they might not even be necessary and can be skipped to save a cancels the whole processing of a request by using a and the lifecycle events after that will not be fired at why for example there is no or something would consider moving your logic to a different layer of and maybe initialize the database when actually requested from a then you can close the database file within the same method that you needed the this would make you much more independent of the state the is sure if this is the info you were looking for though

me give you an example of the use of nested classes that might clarify when this kind of architecture is i recently needed to generate an html table by pulling selected columns from a data table and them so that rows become columns and vice in my there were two essential pivoting the data and generating some rather complex output was not just showing the each data row was subject to operations for extracting generating image setting up thus using a sql pivot really right an initial attempt to create one class to do the whole i recognized that much of the fell into three distinct header row and i decided that a better approach would be to encapsulate the logic for and into nested this allowed me to separate the data held by each row and program the pivot operations very cleanly a separate row object for each column in your data at the end of the pivot i generated output by calling the header object and then each row object in turn to generate its output back to the main classes appropriate because the nested classes did need some data from the master class and the processing was very specific and not useful just programming one big class was simply messier due to confusion surrounding terms such as and which differed depending on whether you were talking about data or html this was unusual work in that i was generating html in my business class so i wanted to pull apart the pure business logic from the ui in the nested classes provided the perfect of encapsulation and data

might want to be careful of the hippo in the the highest paid opinion is not always a good tended to focus more on providing great tools and support for these done take some of the hassle out of so that it becomes faster and more developers are then more flexible in terms of their and more amenable to testing and deployment are a couple of good ones to start make sure every developer can run up their own software stack in a few seconds and try out ideas developers are then able to make revisions quickly or run down side paths they find and these paths are often the most and by successful i mean measured success based on real metrics gathered right in the system and made readily available to all the owner is then able to set the which they probably care rather than the which they either care about or have no experience in course it depends on the owner and your particular but found that metrics are easier to discuss than and that developers are pretty good at interpreting them a typical problem might be that customers seem to spend a long time filling their shopping carts but go on to a marketing requirement might be to make the checkout button bigger and the requirement might be to take the customer straight to as the ceo only ever buys one item at a time the ui requirement might be to place a second checkout button at the top of the cart as well as the existing one at the the requirement might be some web ajax widget that follows the mouse pointer around the the customer probably saw the ridiculous cost of delivery and ran but redefine the problem as a instead of a and suddenly the developer becomes the developer have to do 10 rounds with the cmo on what shade of red the button should he can play with his web thing all and then rush off the other 3 solutions on monday each one gets deployed live for 48 hours and the gets measured and reported none of it makes any but the developer got to do their job and the business shifts focus onto the crappy products they sell and the price they gauge on so the example is a lot of work in there to make sure that the project is the team is hot deployment is instant rollback is and that on what we wanted to get to is a state where the full potential is not so why involved not just from the but also in the start out with an issue like the number of clicks during registration is too run it through a design and we found that the number of clicks actually went up in the design that was our experience but leave the developer some freedom to just the number of and you might actually end up with a patented as we not that the developer cares about but it had merit and no

more details from prefix enables the use keywords as which useful when interfacing with programming the character is not actually part of so the identifier might seen in other languages as a without the identifier with an prefix is a verbatim use of the prefix for identifiers that are keywords is but discouraged as a matter of language with therefore allows to derive from a class named which might be defined in a library written in another language than any other case i would not recommend to use this syntax and rather make up identifiers different from the keywords valu instead of to increase code readability and avoid confusion whether there is any special meaning attached to is also another interesting fact about variable naming mentioned containing two underscore characters reserved for use by for implementation might provide keywords that begin with	
more like you want to use powershell you can spawn new windows other by using see also although you probably have to use some other tools and a little trickery to create something like a have only a maximum of instances running at a you could achieve the latter by using and counting how many are already there loop or if and simply wait 2 and again whether you can spawn a new have cobbled together a little test batch for in do call lss 5 rem just a dummy program that waits instead of doing useful rem but suffices for echo starting processing instance for start 5 goto wait a can be adjusted with 2 because the first ping returns otherwise just use an address unused and waiting for instances to close 2 jump back to see whether we can spawn a new process this could probably be done but instances should contain the number of running instances in csv eq do set spawns a maximum of four new processes that execute in parallel and wait time needs to be adjusted depending on how much each process does and how long it is you probably also need to adjust the process name for which tasklist is looking if doing something is no way to properly count the processes that are spawned by this one way would be to create a random number at the start of the batch and create a helper batch that does the processing spawns the processing but which can set its window title to a would be a simple batch that sets its title to the first parameter and then runs the second parameter with the third as you can then filter in tasklist by selecting only processes with the specified window title eq this should work fairly reliable and prevents too many false searching for would be a bad idea if you still have some instances as that limits your pool of worker can use to create a sensible default of how many instances to can also easily adapt this to use to spawn the processes remotely be very viable as you have to have admin privileges on the other machine as well as provide the password in the you would have to use process names for filtering	
more method of moving data from variablea to variableb is to use the move for to move from arraya to arrayb you can do the arraya of arrayb of this is where the move from arraya to arrayb works by the fact that the array is layed out in a linear so your copying the bytes starting at the first array for the length of the

most important thing is to understand why the choice was made and use the team to determine if this is something that you would want to team buying is important for these kind of decisions and the team is more than just the source control trees contain things such as so there is a legitimate chance that the structure was determined by multiple parties to find a common use tfs where i as we do have a common root folder called control that is the main folder that all team projects live this choice was made because of the extreme by all that the drive would get cluttered with various you have the option to map multiple so what you do on your local machine is dictated by the structure on the my personal and my as is to use a single workspace mapping to the source control given the shelving functionality in there is not a concern about having multiple copies checked since they can be shelved if something else needs to be worked build server has the same as this in no matches the deployment builds are dropped based upon the criteria of the the only time this presents a problem is when absolute paths are in configuration for since we are not using absolute paths definition in our developer this is a

most of you may be following my line of questions already trying to create a program that can serialize multiple structs to a read them back in via loading edit the and then them to the file and so a inventory program i am trying to do and i get it to work for the life of file loading is my program takes like 10 seconds to even load and now i know cause the size of my vector is like 250 oh this time i ran it the size of my vector was thats a pretty big vector full of there any or compile but i am pretty sure i am doing something the file loading in is completely blank project main project namespace namespace checkcommand const inventoryitem string string int int int int cout to the inventory manager ifstream if cout has been opened else cout opening return cout structlist in cout while string line cout are currently items in cout cout cout add a new record cout display a record cout edit a current record cout exit the program cout cout a command int rvalue if cout entered a invalid try else if cout calling else if return checkcommand int intreturn int status switch case case case case status status return const out i i out const inventoryitem out out out out return inventoryitem in in in in return in int i i t in return someone simply show me how to turn this in to a program that can actually write serialized vectors full of structs to a and then read them back in so i can edit them and store them back for loading oh my goodness what a ride this has you for any help you can is the size of my vector full of structs so large when i load serialization in from a	
most programs do to signify that some character needs to be treated literally is that they have a defined escape in the following are specially defined characters that usually have a your fun dollar sign character is in and it usually means of what a programmer using regular expressions has to do to have these characters interpreted literally is that they need to express those characters as an escape for to interpret as and not of the programmer uses which is the escape your you can store literal dollar signs into your compressed file as inverts this above solutions to store as becomes confusing when you have runs of in the bmp

my current project a server product with no gui trying to write in better error handling errors currently are outputted to the logs and are typically not read by use postgresql as our database backend and we access it using direct jdbc calls and daos via a database most database related exceptions are wrapped in a generic class that implements and attempts to pull out debugging and state information from the exception it was in our particular it will access the underlying postgresql database driver so far this approach has worked well for getting more verbose information about what caused the database with the notable exception described since we have very specific performance and legacy support requirements we have a lot of custom sql that makes the following the stack trace back a bit more time intensive but not impossible or have noticed that when we get a as a result of a faulty sql the implementation does not return the sql statement that caused the after doing a little i found out that there is a way to drop the postgresql driver into a debug mode on startup and have it display properties about its internal it is undesirable for us to run the driver in debug mode in our production environment honestly i been able to figure out how to get it into the freakin anyone else dealt with this same issue before and found a if is there some oop pattern out there for storing query information before execution and then assigning that information to the exception or do most developers just feel that they need the full query to troubleshoot database i it because i have the full stack trace and i can look up the invoking but it definitely speeds up my debugging by having it be the first thing that i see in the error do i get at the sql statement that caused an sqlexception using the postgres jdbc driver in	
my current project we use a simplified version of the query object pattern that mausch in our case we have a search criteria object that consists of a field and a and several such objects can be added to a we did have an operator property from the but it was never used so we removed whether the criteria are treated as and or or depends on the search method that is used would say that it is and in of the cases in that find methods themselves do not do a lot with this they will invoke stored procs in the passing the criteria as most of those procs are fairly straight even though we have a couple that does involve some string handling to unpack lists of critera for certain code from a perspective might look something like this controller classes wraps repetetive stuff as instantiating a search object with a configurable populating it with search criteria and customers customer more than one search criterion is needed a collection can be passed inside the finder function the code will loop over the map the present values to appropriate parameters in an sqlcommand approach has worked out rather well for the means that we have created an architecture wher the search objects are defined as abstract classes that merely will define the interface and contain some generic and post the actual search code is implemented in separate decendent which amongst other things allowed us to quickly create a data that could be used for mocking away the database for some of the unit	
my design the ui this is for our as a complex ui will almost immediately alienate potential we prototype our designs on then as we decide on specifics for the prepare the view and any appropriate controller code for continuous interactive prototyping of our we move towards an acceptable we then write a spec for the workflow logic of the paper is and churning through designs guarantees that at least spent a small amount of time thinking about the implementation rather than coding specs are kept in revision control along with our if we decide on a or want to we branch the and immediately update the spec to detail what trying to accomplish with this particular unit tests for branches are not they are required for anything we want to incorporate back into found this encourages are not nor are they owned by any particular by committing the spec to the democratic environment of source we encourage constant experimentation and revision as long as it is documented so we saying a recent iphone game yet we ended up with almost 500 which later translated into nearly 20 different a huge number of concept simplifications to on the progress bar instead of a separate a number of rejected and 3 new the great thing is and every was so it was easy to visualize how the idea could change the each major build in trunk gets with unit tests we try to have at least 2 people test out the we try to find people who have little knowledge of as found far too easy to design complexity rather than use doxygen to generate our we really have auto generation incorporated into our build process but we are working on do not code if the unit test and the source cause probably ok but this is because we are able to rely on the quality of our this probably would not work in all testing has been a for our programming since any new code can not be passed into trunk without appropriate unit we have fairly good coverage with our and moderate coverage in our it is no substitute for user testing only a tool to aid in getting to that bug we use we like but it works for we will probably soon either roll our own solution or migrate to our goal is to not release software until we reach a 0 known bugs because of this our updates to our existing code packages are usually fairly our flow usually looks something like ui spec planning code unit tests 1 or controller model spec planning 2 or controller code unit tests 3 or idea spec coding unit idea spec coding unit unit tests 2 or bugs bug tracker bug repair 2 or product bug reports 2 or process is not perfect by any but a perfect process would also imply perfect humans and technology and not going to happen anytime the amount of paper we go through in planning is staggering maybe time for us to get a contract with dunder

my estimating hardware for an application that been built and designed yet is more of a political issue than a scientific by the time you finish the current hardware capability and their functional expected number of concurrent external systems and all other things will change and this change is beyond your this question comes up very often since you need to put numbers in a proposal or provide a report to your if it is a what you are trying to accomplish is to come up with a spec that can support the proposed sofware the only trick is to propose a system that will not increase your cost for competiteveness while not puting yourself at the risk of a low performance	
my every pear project that was potentially interesting had major points against is targetted at the widest audience there are hacks in place all over the place to deal with php new useful features are ignored if they be emulated on older meaning you end up lagging behind the core language given project tends to grow until it solves problem with a single simple when your php interpreter has to process all of that source code on every page hit the authors may not have designed it to be there is a measurable overhead for processing thousands of unused lines of was always it never felt like i was learning generalizable apis like in other used to use at we discovered that most of our scripts spent their time inside pear code instead of our own replacing that with a very simple wrapper around functions significantly reduced execution time and increased runtime due to the use of prepared used its own at the logic for postgres because the native functions were too new to be used i feel like pear is good as a in many it is likely to be higher quality code than any individual will produce in a short amount of but i would certainly not use it in a popular website not without a lot of tweaking by maintaining my own

my you use a relational database when any one of these criteria are data is structured as a hierarchy or a graph of arbitrary typical access pattern emphasizes reading over no requirement for hierarchies and graphs do not translate well to relational even with the assistance of proprietary extensions like chasing down trees is a mighty pain using databases add a lot of overhead for simple read transactional and referential integrity are but overkill for some so for a file metaphor is good you simply need a relational database with its query language if there are no unexpected queries if there are no suits asking questions like many blue widgets did we sell in on the east coast grouped by and there never will then can live free of

need more details to offer actual but you might want to look into delegation refers to the use of a single event listener on a parent object to listen for events happening on its children deeper event delegation allows developers to be sparse in their application of event listeners while still reacting to events as they happen on highly specific this proves to be a key strategy for maintaining high performance in web where the creation of hundreds of event listeners can quickly degrade basic you have a div with like instead of 4 you have or you want to bind a click event to images so that x action is performed when the user clicks on most first code might look like is going to bind a crapload of event handlers that will bog down the performance of your with event you can do something like will only bind 1 event to the actual you can then figure out what was clicked by using the property and delegate this is still kind of a and you can actually get this significant performance improvement without doing all this by using this

not a heard this kind of question before and it stems from a confusion with reference where circular referencing does pose a collector count it just scans and flags referenced those flags also prevent it from going into a this is a very simple and virtually foolproof the system need to count or track inbound so there is zero overhead for shortlived but you have to keep an eye on where references a common problem are objects that subscribe to the event keeps a so you need to unsubscribe before the subscribing object can be another benefit of gc is that the logic also works in whenever your code has access to a reference that reference is guaranteed to be simply because that reference counting requires the compiler to inject code every time a reference is copied or goes out of incurring a constant when the count drops to zero the object can be immediately the system needs a mechanism to handle you can find some horror stories by searching for the com iunknown

not clear exactly what has in but suggest a few some of which may not be feasible due to other written this out pretty much as thought about it i think it helps to see the train of thought in as make it easier for you to do the same thing next you like my of course is inherently functional in that means that queries have for expect a method with a signature return a new sequence of user objects with extra rather than mutating the existing the only information currently appending is the so add a method in along the lines user whatever you need to create a clone of this user clone new return might even want to make fully immutable there are various strategies around such as the builder ask me if you want more the main thing is that created a new user which is a copy of the old but with the specified inner back to your currently got three methods but my is that only the first one needs to be and that the rest of the api actually need to expose the facebook it looks like your method is basically although probably line up the query in terms of given a sequence of local users and a collection of facebook left doing the actual mapping a straight clause is because it yield the local users which have a matching facebook we need some way of treating a user as if they were a facebook user without an essentially this is the null object can do that by coming up with a facebook user who has a null uid the object model allows adjust for however the user should actually be static readonly facebookuser nullfacebookuser new we actually want a of these because what static readonly nullfacebookusers we can simply this dummy entry to our real and do a normal inner note that this that the lookup of facebook users will always find a user for any facebook if not the need to revisit this and not use an inner include the user at the then do the join and project using var facebookusers return from user in join facebookuser in facebookusers equals select the full class would sealed class facebookmapper private static readonly nullfacebookusers public var facebookusers return from user in join facebookuser in facebookusers equals select private var uids u in where select return facebook users for uids using few points noted the inner join becomes problematic if a facebook uid might not be fetched as a valid we get problems if we have duplicate facebook users each local user would end up coming out replaces the avatar for second group see if we can address these assume that if fetched facebook users for a single facebook then it matter which of them we grab the avatar from they should be the we need is a group so that for each local user we get a sequence of matching facebook then use to make life can keep as it was before but this time only going to call it if got a facebook user to grab the avatar a group join in query expressions is represented by this query is reasonably but not too var facebookusers return from user in join facebookuser in facebookusers equals into let firstmatch select firstmatch null user the query expression but with sequence is just our local user in perform a group join the range variable now be a sequence of facebookusers with the right this could be facebookuser in facebookusers equals into convert an empty sequence into a single null and then take the element the first matching facebookuser or firstmatch if not got a return the original otherwise return a new copy with the appropriate firstmatch null user option is to only use linq very for var facebookusers var uiddictionary foreach user in facebookuser if out yield return yield return uses an iterator block instead of a linq query will throw an exception if it receives the same key twice one option to work around this is to change to make sure it only looks for distinct private var uids u in where select return facebook users for uids using assumes the web service works of course but if it you probably want to throw an exception anyway your pick out of the the group join is probably hardest to but behaves the iterator block solution is possibly the and should behave okay with the immutable would almost certainly be a positive step nice of all of these solutions is that the users come out in the same order they went that may well not be important to but it can be a nice this helps been an interesting question is mutation the way to seen in your comments that the local user type is actually an entity type from the entity it not be appropriate to take this course of making it immutable is pretty much out of the and i suspect that most uses of the type will the it may be worth changing your interface to make that instead of returning an implies to some extent you might want to change both the signature and the leaving you with something like sealed class facebookmerger public void var facebookusers var uiddictionary foreach user in facebookuser if out private var uids u in where select return facebook users for uids using this a particularly solution the main any more but as not really

not easy at represents a generic and not an if any way you could do so to optimizations and other things done by the some data might be thrown so it might be impossible to get the original expression be disassembling the il on the fly and inferring the expression is by no means treating lambda expressions as data is a magic done by the the compiler builds an expression tree in code instead of compiling it to is why languages that push lambdas to the extreme are often easier to implement as in those code and data are essentially the same thing at but our chip cannot understand that form of so we have to emulate such a machine by building an interpreter on top of it that understands it choice made by lisp like or sacrificing the power will no longer be exactly equal to to some extent choice made by in the compiler gives the illusion of treating code as data by allowing lambdas to be interpreted as and at

not entirely clear what you but if trying to only add where clauses for the parameters which are you could string query if query if query if query if query return tried and that linq to sql would get confused by the code to find the value of the nullable value you may need to write code like if int querycourseid query worth trying the simpler form first though all this gets a bit a helpful extension method could make life more static where tparameter ret if ret return then use it like string query x x x if query return a higher order function like this could get confusing if not really comfortable with it so if not doing very many queries like this you might want to stick with the longer but simpler

not going to be able to do this the features built into are all scoped to the individual given that going to have to code your own method to handle the best you were using a suggest that you use a fourth make the id column in the three main tables a foreign key in which you stored the fourth and synchronize inserting a row into the fourth table with inserting a row into either of the other something into sequence values into tablea values you want to use a which suggests to me that you really care about the persistence of these id if they really only need to exist while your application is you can just use a static field to store the last used and make a helper static class private static int private static object lockobject new public static int lock return locking strictly but no harm in making this code you can handle the event on each of your three data t new datatablenewroweventargs will insure that whatever method adds a new row to each table whether your code calling or a new row being added via a data bound control each row added will have its id column set to the next

not quite sure if this is a good approach not the why you designing for in that your design is what more can anyone ask the tests come in the middle or last matter as much as designing for in the changes to the design will make tests and you can fix changes to the tests in anticipation of design changes will make the tests both are you get to the end of your design and something hard to test in the then you failed to do have to refactor your design to make it

one of the main things you can do in a dvcs like git that work well in svn is the create several development branches off of trunk for various features that are under merge code from one feature branch into another feature branch before either feature branch is finished and ready to be merged into merge the feature branches into nice to break new features off into separate branches so that trunk stays clean until the features are inevitably you run into a situation where a team working on one feature branch has written some code that is needed by a team on another feature if you merge this code across feature branches with have trouble merging into trunk later git avoids this another your company decides to outsource development of a feature to an indian contracting your professional services group needs to add a feature for a and that feature may be productized in the you really want to give write access to your svn to the indian contractor or your ps they have to build the code outside of source and you have to merge it in detecting and resolving any conflicts yourself without any help from and losing all of the history in the with you just give the contractor or your ps group a copy of the and they can commit to it just like a you can use features to merge the changes back into your git git will find the and it will preserve one of the coolest things about git is that you really have to convince your friend that better than because git integrates so well with your can happily use svn while you happily use a git connected to the

one part of the application working there is a form control that does validation on reception of the cmexit which is exactly how the delphi documentation says to do it code sample is from the delphi help tell data link to update database on exception do if it let focus leave purpose of this is to perform the validation as soon as the control loses for if i were to click on the ok the form control would lose this method would run and on an exception would set the focus back to that form the event on the ok button would never go through and the dialog would never problem having is that this form control is inside a modal dialog clicking ok does indeed send the cmexit message and causes the record to update validation to pressing enter while in the form control causes the modal dialog to close sending the cmexit as if the form control never this means that not only does the dialog close without the form actually validating the but the data set this where is the best place for me to place my dataset i could move it up to the dialog form itself and implement it in the onclosequery but this would mean that the logic is duplicated in both the form control on the form form control is used in other and i want to avoid changing its speculate that cmexit triggered because the control never actually lose the form is but the form control still on the closed cmexit message not sent when modal dialog is

only recently started with but basically interested in these i write any code if i learn i use windows mostly at work and linux at most of my friends use windows either predominantly or i know people with i would like the option of writing code for all of after trying a number of operating systems and operating system formed the opinion that the free stuff is of a higher also i find it more morally so i want to be restricted my library to writing proprietary after trying a number of operating systems and operating system formed the opinion that a real quality product forms more readily with strong commercial red novell and canonical make flavours of linux that appeal strongly to me and what do you commercial windows and mac os x are commercial operating and good enough for most this only serves to emphasize my simple build i come from a scripting and accustomed to having my changes applied the moment i hit save in a text editor not having to so having a very quick and simple build process is important to if i can use the same build procedure on multiple platforms by flicking a switch on a i feel like strayed too far from the scripting other look at me i know all the silly compsci 102 the first language i was really comfortable with is php is quite the powerful object oriented but most of the examples most of the completely ignores any object oriented believe me when i all the facilities for that kind of programming exist in php just that unless taught it you will learn all the things first like i i want to be able to participate in and i mind having to work to figure out how to apply it in if i get to choose which paradigm i subscribe even does qt stack easier to learn than pure you need to learn both to use it i had to do platform detection even i will have to when i finish my current project because there will be an option to wake up the display and linux test on a when certain events occur in the but arguably pretty low you can write a text web browser or game without needing a feature like my qmake project files are portable to all platforms without special software without requiring cygwin or although if i wanted to switch to msvc there would be no qt allows me to release my work under the gnu gpl if i and this makes me qt is backed by everyone knows i own a fairly expensive nokia with a bunch of qt apps on furthermore other companies like red hat et al submit the odd patch now and you get much more commercial than qmake how hard is it works on it works on it even works on i have to define anything or rewrite any project files or idiotproof and it never goes although i break free of object oriented programming when i use i can stray pretty far from it before the application falls and when i oop in qt is always waiting with open arms to welcome me i mind having to use objects of various kinds for no matter what mood in it feels pretty natural under as a never tried another library and i probably never i can get everything i need from qt at this even json and soap and file locking and quite capable of writing c code and i like plain c a looking into learning about doing not because of any dissatisfaction with after a bit of soul searching qt seemed like the obvious choice chose the not the language and then started writing it in its native i want to learn gtk because so many free software projects interested in use and interested in having the knowledge to contribute to some very interesting projects include browsers and instant messengers networking code is something pretty well familiar with of php even if it is in totally the wrong language so when some protocol problem happens in a software product i know what it is gone way off track now retaining the the point is that qt has everything i was looking for in a including portability and a shallow learning performance as good as doing native api function calls apparently but i still very quick compared to most scripting languages is more than fast enough if you write good code and even sometimes if you and still faster than many programming rather finish the application in one year and have it take an hour to than take ten years to write the same program to do that same job in 45 minutes the slower version is a stepping but bear in mind comparing the abstracted model to the bare api more information about how using a library can make an application more stable and more fun to look for me personally the questions is not switch to but move away from and there is absolutely no reason to do so at hooked for only be working with other systems if i happen to be hacking someone not used mfc i possibly tell you that moving to qt is the right thing to but i tell try see whether difficult to learn to use see if it hurts your work in any if you i bet you would win

only way to really use entities end to end is to use something a little bit more sophisticated than in my experience going to have to manage the hibernate session manually at the application opensessioninview will only give you the same session for one after that need to be constantly reattaching to the current take a look at seam and or implement your own hibernate session we currently manually manage our sessions based on when a wizard starts and ends and use spring aop to attach sessions to the right threads just in are not thread not a good mix with on the other hand most certainly are going to need some form of i see a way around entities may look like pojos but serializing them can range from difficult to nearly just create dtos that fit with the goal of the service method and be done with i think the dto pattern is if just making a website feasible to go end to end with entities and it may even buy you some performance but if like a more flexible stick with

operator is a method with a special you can treat it like any other	
operators are like a little can make something too much can make it	
operators are potentially excellent ways to do certain but are horribly easy to the and operators makes it easy to extend both in new kinds of new objects for and overloading makes smart pointers almost a replacement for overloaded operators make it possible to have a string concatenation and to build up new sorts of numbers that are syntactically just like having them makes it possible to do things in libraries that would require changes in other do have their there is no operator suitable for there is only one multiplication and in some cases more than one way to multiply 3d for at least the dot and cross the and comma operators cannot replicate their since they have evaluations and sequence of they can be no language for that arithmetic operators have to work anything like seen horrible things done in an effort to come up with a sql notation that somebody thought was in a program that was badly impossible to know x since or maybe or and the operator functions could be written to do intention in designing was to include useful features regardless of the possibility of whereas james intention in designing java was to exclude excessively abusable features even if they were somewhat not clear to me that either of those philosophies is correct or but they are was designed to avoid situations that would usually call for some like operator multiple and type so they often whether this is good or bad or neither is not something i far as teaching tell them not to overload operators themselves under defined such as functors and the assignment but point out how the library uses overloaded i trust any student to do them and if going to be able to do it they can and will learn it on their they will know because you forbade it in some of the ones i would never trust with anything more complicated than a statement will find out how to overload and will do but

pieced together some code to insert a dynamic image into a pdf using both and while filling in some form fields as after i got it working and blogged about i help but think that there might be a better way to accomplish using the basic idea of this in a production app right now so any comments or suggestion would be most full path to pdf you want to add image full path to the pdf we will using to a unique file name so we can delete it full path to the image you want to java output buffer to write reader to read our stamper so we can modify our existing get the content of our existing create an image object so we can add our dynamic image to our get the form setting a value to our form you want to put initalize our centering our image top center of our existing pdf with a little margin from the 2 now we assign the position to our add our image to the existing flattern our form so our values close the stamper and output our new close the write out new pdf to the browser file deletefile a dynamic image to a pdf using coldfusion and

point numbers should be used for what they were designed computations where what you want is a fixed and you only care that your answer is accurate to within a certain if you need an exact answer in all best using something are three domains where you might use floating apps require a lot of number and often use sophisticated numerical methods to solve systems of differential typically talking floating point of games as a simulation where ok to if the physics is to seem real then ok for and you can make up in user experience what missing in terms of games usually use floating science statistical methods need a lot of floating a lot of the numerical methods are the the application domain is just you find a lot of statistics and monte carlo simulations in financial applications and in any field where analyzing a lot of survey point and for most business applications you really need to know all these fine just knowing that you represent some decimal numbers exactly in floating and that you should be sure to use some decimal type for prices and things like you really want to get into the details and understand all the tradeoffs and check out the classic every programmer should know about floating or pick up a book on or numerical linear if really	
point of scrum is for the developers to we use scrum where i and jobs get passively sorted by a we do it on purpose with a chart and it just we all know best at or what their focuses if the person needs they get the with a secondary focus in it to we do get plenty of tasks not necessarily in line with whatever our particular focus but you always know who to ask for help your example i know that if you say had 3 server guys and 5 gui that expect to get all the work done in that sprint the server guys some help from the others the way the sprint is supposed to work is that from a prioritized the developers pick what they think they can get done in that if that meant the gui guys needed 2 days of training in order to what unless there were concurrent things also high up the list that they could do the sprint tasks are not supposed to be dictated by management as a you have a safari an interesting mostly book by one of the who invented

pointers are a poor attempt to be you could even make an argument that having function pointers makes a language since you can write higher order functions with closures and easy sorta so you tend to use them far less than mainly for oo design works around using functions by instead creating a whole interface type to pass in the function has so function pointers actually store an object so not just a raw but typed state are vastly more usable of the comments said there should be a demonstration of higher order functions with function any function taking a callback function is a higher order wndenumproc lparam parameter is the function to pass easy but since there are no closures in we get this lovely second an value to be passed to the callback that value allows you to manually pass around untyped state to compensate for lack of framework is also filled with similar for a object that qualifies or contains information about an asynchronous since the iar is all you get on your without you need a way to shove some data into the async op so you can cast it out

possibility is to use you describe with a script how you project is to be and cmake generates the visual studio files for if you need to build your project from the command or in a continuous integration you use cmake to generate a makefile for if you project is a one you can run cmake to generate the makefiles for the toolchain of your simple cmake script looks like these two lines with a makefile or the way you setup a simple project in your favorite a nutshell cmake does not only your project it also makes it if you like to just test your project with eclipse or or just run cmake to generate the corresponding project in practice it is no always so but the cmake idea just if you consider using cmake with visual studio there is some tweaking required to obtain the familiar vs project main obstacle is to organize your header and source but it is possible check the cmake wiki by writting a short script you might even simplify this

potential you must use the i suggest you wrap the call to with an explicit string reason is that returns what i believe is a constant memory reference at the meaning that you are not being returned a copy of the but actually whatever qstring is available at the memory you call the it is the string you but eventually it is something else when the contents at the memory reference are i have noticed this peculiarity with several methods on different most notably where i typically have to make an explicit copy the qdate returned by the function of qdateedit by wrapping it in a qdate use the method the qstring returned is a constant instead of a constant memory see this const qstring looks like riverbank will be addressing this problem in future versions of pyqt in case anybody is still having this copying of in current pyqt wraps a returned by a function it the address of the value it does not enforce the this can cause behavour program by the underlying value or the value being correct way to handle this is explicitly make a copy of the using its copy that is not pythonic knowing that it needs to be requires knowledge of the will be changed so that it automatically invoke the constructor and will wrap the

primitive way to do it would be to look out for network disconnection your sequence would for network connections status maintain a list of all active network the first available network connection you could sort it based on interface and use the one with highest you detect a down use the next active if there are implications to the functionality of your based on which network connection you you are much better having either a routing protocol do the job for or have a tracking application within your this tracking application would track network paths various methods like across all your available interfaces to see which one can reach the ultimate and use the appropriate network you could monitor your network interfaces for not just status but also for and change your selection this would help you use the most efficient network at any given point of but this would need to be balanced with the churn caused by switching a network

problem in general terms is the security model of java that actually attempts to prevent that a class that has already been loaded be loaded course java since the beginning has supported dynamic class what it is difficult is class was consider harmful and for a good reason that a running java application got injected with an new class with malicious for instance a cracked implementation comming from the internet that instead of creating deletes some random file hile invoking the method they way java was conceived and i presume clr in because it was highly in was to prevent an already loaded class to load again that same offered a mechanism to override this but again the rules for the class loaders they should ask permission to the classloader before attempting to load a new if the parent has already loaded the the new class is instance i have used classloaders that load a classes from ldap or rdbms hot deploy becomes a necessity in the java world when the application server became mainstream for java ee and also create the need for micro containers like spring to avoid these kind of burden the whole app server after every compile drives anyone app server offer this class loaders to help hot and using a configuration that should be disabled when set in but the tradeoff is you have to use tons of memory in so the good way to do this is restart every 3 4 happen with other languages that were designed from the beginning to load their ruby for you can even add methods to a running override a method at runtime or even add a single method to an unique specific tradeoff in these kinds of environments is of course memory and hope this found this product some time ago that promises that reload is make as simple as i remember the link when i first wrote this and i is from

problem is that actually do any boundary checking with regards to it depends on the os to ensure that you are accessing valid this particular you are declaring a stack based depending upon the particular accessing outside the bounds of the array will simply access another part of the already allocated stack space and threads reserve a certain portion of memory for as long as you just happen to be playing around in the stack everything will not crash i did not say happening on the last line is that you have now accessed beyond the part of memory that is allocated for the as a result you are indexing into a part of memory that is not allocated to your process or is allocated in a read only the os sees this and sends a seg fault to the is one of the reasons that is so dangerous when it comes to boundary

problem is that garbage collection only happens when there is memory unmanaged handles are more restricted than so you can run out of handles before gc causing for one or two it hurt you bigger problem is that some of the objects are shared and be disposed	
problem is that listview control is basically a wrapper around windows list view so when we set the cursor to the underlying listview control always defaulted to hand cursor while our setting in the listview class wanted it to be an why we were getting that because underlying control was reverting back to is the code that you need to const uint static extern intptr uint intptr intptr very important that you call the sendmessage from your onload event because by then the underlying listview control is completely pretty simple have a great	
problem is that nsnumber objects are meaning that you cannot change their so in order to change a value you have to create a new nsnumber of course you have mynumber point to different object than the one you added to the so you have to update the array by replacing the changed nsnumber this leaves you with the problem that you have to store the index together with each nsnumber in order to be able to update the which is incovenient if you want to pass the nsnumber object around and allow changing the could solve this problem by introducing a wrapper object that you wrap around nsnumber in order to allow transparent updates or you just could create your own class that handles your doublevalue a mutable nsnumber	
problem is that the conversion tools offer support for the vb6 graphics commands or the vb6 printer plus you get into a lot of corner cases when dealing with activex i know our own applications translate over with any conversion tools as a lot of tweaks are built into the ui to make it work smoothly with the vb6 form are things that conversion tools fail on as the winform engine requires own the same thing was experienced when our software moved from dos to sometimes there is no substitution for manual that being there are somethings you can do to make conversion considerably first make sure your application is built in this way you can convert one layer at a test and continue it also has the advantage of leaving you with usable software at every i recommend starting at the top layer and working your way sure anything that is vb6 centric and not basic centric is behind an when first came out several years ago i created a canvas interface and implemented that using the vb6 graphics i use the same canvas interface in except now it uses the graphics the same was done for all the code was moved out of our forms into classes that the forms the forms themselves implement an interface that the ui classes when we switched to we have a precise definition of how the form interacted with the rest of the system and form conversion was considerably of these steps where done in vb6 and put through our normal release then afterward we started the	
problem is that the marker and the so never achieve what you are trying to do using so only choice is your issue is that some lists can have up to 9 items others have up to 99 items and still others have up to 999 items i would say that you have 2 create a different class for each list you know the count ahead of maybe call them so for 1 digit you would abandon lists altogether and just use tables know but you would guarantee proper wrapping and indentation no matter how many items are in the	
problem is that you are doing multiple passes of the try just stepping through the characters of the string in a loop and replacing each character by its that way not going back over the string and those characters already create a separate output string or instead of modifying the ideally use a and append the new string the original character if not replacing this to	
problem is that you can only cast a value to an int if it does indeed contain an clearly your first 18 rows but then if you include more it reaches a row where the value cannot be cast to an int and you get the error you how about bigmacs as bigmacsb from where bigmacs like bigmacs like will find all rows containing a number within the text of this column that is greater than 5 there are no decimals or negative numbers

problem is that your first replace string is going to be matched by the second search effectively overwriting the first replace string with the second replace you can somehow differentiate links from the original ones so that they get caught by the other expression by adding an extra html i think you can really solve this with a single one possible solution from the differentiation in the regular that comes to mind would be to use since it will give you an array of matches to work you could probably then encode the matched urls with your tracking url by iterating over the array and running a on each matched	
problem is that your memory accesses are out of rotation your newrow and newcolumn may be larger than the original of the they may even be if you take care about that end up with garbage data or most common way to deal with this is to just ignore all such you could also clamp or wrap around the valid this a padding or tiling shown with ignoring outside width height row row for column column int newrow int newcolumn if

problem is worse than the previous two answers you know what to sound so but where did you ever see something like and what did it mean or what do you even want that to figure out what you want to create a class that can represent add a property of that class to the server you may have to add a typeconverter or other designer support in order for to convert your preferred textual representation into an instance of the be able to get something like the properties of a going to make a guess about what some of these values and try to show you how to deal with them in a my guess could be far work with assume this applies to the domain of automobile and that the color property is meant to represent the finish given to the car as a in that would probably be an referring to the type of finish i know what other sorts of finish apply to a i know from building model cars when i was a kid that paints may be or or so those three would be enum values of one would be one of many this would give something like enum notpaint enum enum class public finishtype finishtype public paintfinish paintfinish public carcolor carcolor class car public carfinish color would allow for something like

processes are using the same each process gets its own private copy of that static all you need to do is make the list be a global variable in a and link to that dll from every that there is no need to pass anything additional idea of trapping the destruction of the list is fraught with due to the unpredictability of the order of destruction of objects in a would be a lot simpler to dump out the contents of the list at the end of your or not using a smart pointer class in a consistent then do it may be worth looking for cyclic reference counts object a has a count on object and vice this is a common cause of unreleased force all static destructors to run and release so you can then examine the entries in the list need to structure your application a certain you have a very minimal exe that launches the and loads a number of other dlls that actually do all the these other dlls are loaded with somehow by com or a the loadlibrary api works by either loading the dll into the or else incrementing an internal reference counter on the dll if it is already the freelibrary api decrements the counter until it reaches zero and then unloads the dll which point the static destructors for that dll will this we now add our diagnostic dll that holds a list of all outstanding reference counted all the other dlls use linkage to the diagnostic and the exe uses loadlibrary on it as is about to the exe goes through the list of dll handles it previously and calls freelibrary on all of by keeping the diagnostic dll it ensures still there at the the theory at in what order should the other dlls be if has static pointers to objects defined in then you better unload a so you need to have some idea of how your various dlls form a with higher layers depending on lower thus giving you a safe order in which to unload once unloaded all the any entries in the diagnostic list that refer to objects in the dlls will now be pointing to valid data on the but the vtable will be pointing at code that was defined by the dlls that have now been so you be able to call virtual functions on those you should be able to examine their data	
processing arguments to a the powershell parser splits adjacent expressions into discrete arguments if the first fragment is a recognizable expression as is the case with because powershell is we try to preserve object integrity until we absolutely have to render to a if you want to force string expansion put around the entire argument sequence as one of the other posters note that an argument with a leading character like will be treated as if it was a string this is because the leading characters are not recognized as a valid expression so we default to treating it as an expandable powershell

protect is definitely the better way to go what it is there i would strongly recommend you put all your users into and only ever use groups in your protections table much easier to can protect at any level of granularity you so is not note also that the server release has a new protect feature that allows you to specify what you can do in a slightly different change now allows specification of permission only allowed using permission levels which include the specified access and also of its lesser permissions permission rights make it possible to deny individual without having to lesser the new permission rights are and this functionality was previously and is now fully supported for you really have an issue with having to be an admin to lock unlock then you should take a look at the feature introduced in this will let a user to be able to add remove people from a so combine that with the protections get site admin to set up the protections and restrict rights to a group named and make you the group you can then add and remove users from that group to control trigger option is a but you still need to be an admin to set up the trigger in the first you could also affect performance of all which is something to look out but the main issue with triggers is that you would be using them to emulate a built in feature designed for that purpose protections if you wanted to be you would still need to find some way of preventing anyone else modifying the reference it just seems like a lot of work to emulate an existing

put this edit at the top since it directly answers your question of why word is your copy constructor is const theobject make a copy of what points just the so you effectively have two objects pointing to the same internal this gets very bad when a word object gets a proper implementation the techniques you i recomend against would be like const theobject new 1 earwicker noted the following as although that is not a copy so one will and does the same and therefore the same still remedy need to make a proper copy constructor which should have the word this code infile new word like you reallocate after word is read and entirely forget to delete the previous once again show a sane implementation using the techniques you are attempting to infile new word how it counts the then allocates room after it knows how much to now is ready to be used for up to word you just replace the class with it would make the code much smaller and easier to work it makes it easier for just do you can do like it has the added bonus of removing the need for you to use the member to get the would also change your to just be a that way you can simple do more dynamic all done for size of the word array will be limited only by the amount of ram you because grows as needed when you use if you do what to get the word count you simply do need to manually keep track of the number of this code is infile2 eof set till you attempt a you are better off using this will correctly stop on if you do this there should be very little actual code you need to a sample straight forward implementation of what i think you from the menu items it seems that the intention is for the user to choose option then zero or more times to filter out some then finally c to print the results word per option really needed since hitting sends an eof to the program and makes the test thus ending the least in my it might be for it makes no effort did to deal with but here it public bool char const return make a read a text remove words starting with print words to const int const char char case case a file scope so we can have locals int words read from the file case case scope so we can have locals letter to char remove all words starting with a certain case case output each word to separated by return	
put your code into a test page and to be perfectly even with thirty or so divs it seemed ok certainly responsive enough to use from my sliding the mouse over a bunch of them means i have to wait for the rollover effect to go through them all which takes a while until it gets to the one actually stopped but surely that was what you wanted given that using rather than would certainly remove any speed not using actual images in my test just getting the alt so my best current guess would be to make sure all images loading are as small filesize as you can possibly make

question will always boil down to which operator is most or you have an unordered adding to it takes no and accessing particular items takes extra you have a sorted adding to it takes more but accessing it is applications spending most of their time accessing the rather than adding to which means that the time overhead in creating a sorted list will usually be balanced or covered by the time saved in accessing the there is a lot of churn in your data it sound like there then maintaining a sorted list necessarily because you will be constantly resorting the list as considerable cpu complexity of the data structures only matters if they be sorted in a useful if they can be then have to go by the heuristic of of of determine if sorting is a good

quick answer here is it absolutely should not crash just because you are mixing printf and the only difficulty with mixing the two is that the respective output buffers will not be synced by so the order of the output may be a bit mixed but it definitely should not a quick perhaps you have a formatting problem with printf passing a double when it expects a short or something like that will lead to unpredictable which might well shift depending on the order of function calls in your

quick reference on the principle control working is an is an client has a very ackward modify the appointment label on the devexpress schedulercontrol so that the user can click or double click on a name and go to their profile instead of the appointment edit the subject field text is currently set up to hold the name and phone problem is that appointmentlabels equipped for there is no container attached to the appointment label to insert any kind of button or anything like something like this would be no problem in using the item tried negotiating for some things i thought would achieve the same effect while leveraging extensibility the schedulercontrol such as putting the profile link in the edit form many button or a custom editor or prepared menu confusing for this is the only ui design the client will is it even possible to put a hyperlink control inside the appointment label of a a hyperlink or button in the appointment label of a

ran across some of these issues at work really have a chance to explore it there my issues should an application designer take into consideration when devising the error and exception handling ideal exception handling strategy would be a complete recovery and logging of the the if you could do such a you have written it in the code in the first as not really an per plus your implementation complexity goes the other side of this would be in the realm of autonomic systems and the i believe the most realistic strategy is to always try and force the system into a consistent state minimal you will always be forced to something loss or corrupted loss of resources resulting in reduced being in a consistent state increases your chance of staying operational at a diminished capacity rather than face a total formalizing a consistent state among the project team could mean establishing natural default values which would be used as a reset the strategy will differ depending on the software type business hosted web embedded is the software type think each type of software lends itself to different auditing and qos and it is reflected in the costs associated with downtime and or data the general strategy is the with the strategy is to minimize the appearance of the problem to the user and create you can achieve this by restarting the software quietly reset the with hosted web the session data from a crash can be dumped for later analysis and the user gets a new for a game for things like you invest in maintaining snapshot data to prevent gamers from losing progress in the event of a server server clustering and techniques are also very important in these political and legal is probably the most important part of error and exception which would come in the form of maintaining the end result of those issues is demonstrating the system failure any collateral damage is a result of an unpredictable chain of events which cannot be reasonably foreseen by the also important to demonstrate that whatever handling mechanisms in place had a positive effect by reducing keeping users in the loop in the face of a catastrophic failure is also important did my wow server but my main point is that transparency should be applied to disciplined auditing for the purposes of reconstructing the perspectives on error handling business a error handling should be totally if a server i still want my bank transaction to be completed as scheduled without having to call the bank and rerunning the a error handling is the most difficult part of the application to the number of things which can go resulting from both people and technology and how to classify them into cases which we can write code to handle is immensely we depend on the project budget and management to guide these but in the still like playing a game of russian business support i suppose error handling would be like the insurance paid during the software development phases which reduce the incidences of having to compensate customers who experience inconveniences or outages due to software also a measure of software quality and accountability they want to know which division group developer was

read this article and thought of it when seeing your hope it a primitive polynomial over one can obtain another primitive polynomial by decimating an lfsr sequence obtained from the initial this is demonstrated in the code c in order to generate an lfsr we must first multiply this polynomial by a suitable constant so that the trailing coefficient becomes c we are now able to generate an lfsr sequence of length 72 the initial state can be anything other than lfsrsequence 5 we decimate the sequence by a value d having the property 6 b to get the corresponding primitive we multiply by a constant to make it b

realize you are starting completely over if you you could transition to android or but i stake your livelihood on it unless you are used to freelancing wages and depends on your personality and establish and work on a network in the area you wish to be be be be your opportunities will most likely be related to who you know and how much they want to help too many programmers who spend their life in front of a screen forget that the employer and client are not be a you might look into the winestore that is in this database applications with php and is a fairly approach to learning what a program and an approach in how to get it worry about ajax and other web stuff until you have a grasp on the just be in my which builds issue tracking software written in has an development kit and a if looking to see some code and work in a fairly developed you might try it development is a different skillset than although you might find a way to leverage your ability to concentrate on detail and troubleshooting if you work in python or web programming by nature is linking a bunch of disparate systems and protocols where i would imagine embedded might do but in a much more constrained environment with a lot fewer choices and limited reign for web programming based on languages seem to throw power at so you would ideally find a way to leverage the skill acquired with a language that is predicated on not bells and there are far more java and positions than python so pick you poison is decent if looking to get into the while will pay better but the circumstances are typically much different environments what they might look at getting certified in java or php cert is a they get you a but since already just not in the area you are looking to cert will help you transition your toolset and plus explain the some employers do care certification something fun and think about picking up a interpreted is a good resource list if to get into java

really depends on who notionally the disposable in some you may want to be able to pass in the for instance in the without your class taking responsibility for cleaning it other times you may want to clean it up if creating the object in your sample then it should almost certainly be your responsibility to clean it for the property i think having a property should really transfer ownership or anything like if your type is responsible for disposing of the it should keep that

really enjoy database design and the whole concept of managing data semantically and all the logic that comes with knowledge level when it comes to databases is however would quite basic i can model data relationships correctly with er connection handling etc experienced when it comes to programming in and i figure my database knowledge is like knowing the basics of object oriented how to model a inheriting from the vehicle containing wheel objects and so i would like to further my knowledge about relational databases so that i may confidently say to an employer that i can handle the subject on a professional i can handle right now is probably my movie database in the back end of my personal which probably would collapse if i was amazon and had to store millions of so the subject of scalability sure a pretty array of within database design that you simply must understand and be able to apply in real life if going to work with databases on a professional i would be very grateful if any database gurus in the field could namedrop some case studies or anything that would be beneficial to study to get really good at sure a vast science lurking and i want in databases there has to be more

reason is that floating point numbers are not a real representation of the number that you save in the to bcd coded can see the definition point the problem is that certain numbers are not expressable with a given set of could if you could add bits trick is that in most cases the difference between the saved number and the intended number are pretty in you have some corner cases where this may lead to is for example the reason why you should not build a financial software and use floating point numbers for money you can easily have differences that are which your tax office to compare floating point numbers you should always apply some kind of threshhold that is ok for your something as david mentioned in his you will still get into trouble with things like you can at least store numbers without loss in precision that you put into the as computers have limited memory you can always construct corner cases where you rely on exact saw your edit of the so here is the next somehow because you know whether just the number representation that is wrong or if just a real value that is close to it really depends on the requirements for your if a small error is then not then you have to use another variable type that is not suffering from the

reason that you simply use a grid or dock panel with the textblocks in to control the alignment is because the default template of expander left aligns the header content instead of allowing it to are two ways around you can either specify a width for the content of the header or you can define a new template for the second option is probably the but it is also the harder one to if you have expression blend then you can right click the expander element in the and tree and select control parts edit a once you have done that you will need to modify the template as well can select this time though instead of creating a once your in there you can pretty much just set it to for horizontal alignment and add a bit of margin to the right and your you have expression blend update the question to specify that and i will post some sample the main reason i done that here is that the template is about 250 lines of code and i want to generate alot of noise for no the reply that you gave i am guessing you have if you put the following xaml into xaml pad you should see an example of an expander which will enable the header content to span the full width of the you will most likely want to move the resources for the page into a seperate resource dictionary so you can reuse it throught the l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l as an alternative you could use a dock as shown by the following some

reason to do it is that it puts all of the initialization code in one place which is convenient for others reading your having said this i really do it for two primary i use testing to define the behavior of my if you want to know what the parameterless constructor you should really read the tests built on the parameterless with i typically use automatic properties and inline initialization with a parameterless constructor to instantiate the this is much more flexible and it puts the definition of the properties right in line where the code is being this would override any initialization in the constructor so i rarely put any of this only applies to var foo new foo bar public class public string bar public

recommend that you consider the approach known as vertical this means that you keep defining tables with a userid you could call them start a new table when you hit the maximum row size for your the benefit of this approach is that the values are still true database this will wind up saving time when working with this data key question to answer are these really do they represent the struture of information that you must collect about the if the best way to model them is to make them the only reason you must resort to vertical partitioning is the row size limit of the on the other a flexible attribute system is called then by all means go with the property value for if users were allowed to define their own attributes then definitely want the i would say is not the best way if you understand the structure of your data and have legitimately identified hundreds of attributes for a side i must say that you should question entities with large numbers of they may be but also quite likely that missing some entities at the conceptual in other mabe all of these attributes related to the user per but to some other entity that is related to

redesigning the class structure to remove the bidirectional association is possible and reduces the number of problems associated with the then this is preferred this redesign is not possible or introduces equal or greater implementation then one possible solution is to use a specialized equals method to be called by equals methods of the classes involved in the bidirectional as mehrdad this be too big of a deal since the requirements explicitly ask for this so you are not introducing one by doing is an implementation of this that keeps the specialized methods checking only their own this reduces maintenance problems vs having each class do a comparison of the other public class person private string private string private address public string address firstname lastname address public virtual address get return set public virtual string get return set public virtual string get return set public override bool use rather than a cast to get a null rather an if the object person person obj as return public override int string composite firstname return internal virtual bool per msdn should return if return return public virtual bool per msdn should return if return return have address check public class address private string private string private string private person public string string city state streetname public virtual string get return set public virtual person get return set public virtual string get return set public virtual string get return set public override bool use rather than a cast to get a null rather an if the object address address obj as return public override int string composite streetname city return internal virtual bool per msdn should return if return return public virtual bool per msdn should return if return return public class static void address address1 new address address2 new person person1 new if no stack two addresses are person person2 new if no a stack two addresses are two addresses are two addresses are

say code is which implies that the algorithms are you save the sets are several terabytes in is all about finding and eliminating obvious bottleneck is the bandwidth to the data given the size of the guessing that the data is held on a server rather than on a desktop you given any details of the algorithms is the time taken by the algorithm greater than the time taken to the does the algorithm work on subsets of the total going to assume that the algorithm works on chunks of data rather than the whole have two scenarios to algorithm takes more time to process the data than it does to get the in this you need to optimise the algorithm takes less time to process the data than it does to get the in this you need to increase the bandwidth between the algorithm and the the first you need a developer that can write good assembler code to get the most out of the processors leveraging gpus and multicores if whatever you just crank up the number of threads because as soon as the number of threads exceeds the number of your code goes this due to the added overhead of switching thread another option is to use a seti like distributed processing system many pcs in your organisation are used for admin purposes think of all that spare processing as bh213 can be an order of magnitude slower than well written using but that is a niche skillset these the latter where limited by then you need to improve the network connecting the data to the make sure using the latest ethernet equipment 1gbps everywhere use wireless as if lots of other consider a dedicated network in parallel with the consider storing the data closer to the clients for every five or so clients use a dedicated server connected directly to each client which mirrors the data from the saving a few percent of processing time saves of thousands of then seriously consider getting a consultant two actually one one they should easily pay for themselves in the savings sure many here that are suitably qualified to if reducing cost is the ultimate then consider write code that keeps the cpu ticking over below this saves energy directly and indirectly through reduced thus costing want more bang for your buck so again have more overhead more cpu work more more in when it comes to saving money a lot more to it than what language going to	
say i have a system that stores data for some complex objects in these objects have a weak inheritance maybe 4 fields common to all of them and then another 20 that are unique to each type of say 6 to 8 different types of data that is unique to each object may itself be things like other complex and items that are only used each type of object has an xml schema to describe system builds up a record for each object over a series of and so it will be very common to have only a partial what goes into each step is not a user may fill in as much as they know and then pass it up the chain for someone more knowledgeable to i want to do is create an page to show these given a record number load the schema for that type into a and then populate the form from the record i think the record by itself will be enough to create the because the record may not yet list each field i want to include on the form and implicitly include data for types like would be an elegant way to accomplish sure missing something obvious about a simple way to do but xslt probably cut is a follow up to and at the moment is purely based on responses here i may go a different way page based on xml schema and add data from xml

should be as terse as necessary and no remarks aside there are several factors affecting just how terse it should longer than you think of likely is dependent on many things but the original coder has a big part to play in reading just the think intellisense and the reading it sometimes with the help of programs like diff not the same person that wrote performance these things combine to produce a set of sometimes competing forces which may want more or less these is the key to effective which are more important is totally dependent on the problem your software is trying to off lets take the easy they read your code they are quite capable of doing so irrespective of the they might be a little slower but this is something that is normally hard to measure is unlikely you will go beyond 1 or two orders of magnitude of verbosity than the minimum theoretical exceptions are where you are something like meta programming via a preprocessor to do lots of expansion for this can take a time when here you must decide if this trade off is worth they will be people with similar context to you and they will be reading the source in a similar situation to when you wrote by this it means that if the function was in a called foo then there is no need to go putting foo in front of the foo aspect of it should be quite clear from this makes changing this aspect easier in familiar with the idioms of the of programming you are using will be quite capable of understanding several constructs which are extremely index variables called for example are as terse as you can get but are normally not a problem until your loop becomes you see an interesting the value of terseness is often proportional to the complexity of the block of code within which it as this block becomes more terse the variables within it benefit more from being by writing code in with limited responsibility it becomes easier and more helpful to keep things terse as there is less scope for confusion on the part of a paradoxically this can lead to the need for the context to be more thus longer method and class lifespan and probability of bugs factor into how often you will have to either read the code or debug through many debuggers support break points at multiple points on a line spotting where there are two but some do therefore care should be taken on if you intend to break point within it a lot to make sure you can place and control these with minimal the code has a low probability of bugs but a long lifespan you have another interesting the probability of the code being comprehensible when you come to need to change it is much lower will have a worse memory or may not even be there any this code therefore will benefit from being slightly less terse than occasion you might have to sacrifice a compact but clear representation of something to satisfy a performance perhaps you must bit pack for never a nice thing to read in code but unavoidable if you have to fit in a certain amount of like these are hopefully language constructs can encourage terse code anonymous inner lambdas to name but a where these concepts make sense to use use them the idea is that they reduce boiler plate and expose you do the same thing repeatedly and have a certain amount of code duplication consider a shared but remember that if you must make the shared code less clear an additional if statement or unused variables in one of the code then you may not have a net inference is powerful but remember that the compiler is sometimes much better at it than a if you are saying x new then x new is no stretch at all gets better as flibble gets compare with flibble common sense helps if you would never have to use intellisense to work it out you certainly should consider using other useful rules of actions on a single line often confuse effects often confuse humans or matter at all conceptually unless part of a wider expression for helps most humans to infer structure far more than brackets rules are often by humans rather than remembered as a set of this means that needless the bracketing can be harmful for readability where the idiom is common but useful where the usage is not so not is often a single when using this in an if statement consider whether it can be restructured to not require this may not be possible the resulting contortions to name or ordering of code outweigh the removal leave it

so having a similarly hard time reading the entirety of that but see if i can piece it together from what i did figure start gitk simplifies things by condensing a string of commits into an containing a series of commits that each only have one parent and one aside from anything doing this should cut down pretty dramatically on the number of nodes you have to consider for your which will help out any algorithm you as a related commits will end up grouped does introduce some complexity in terms of finding an arc when you read a new there are a few new commit has a single or no it extends a most of the just extend the most recent there are a few interesting may cause an existing arc to be if its parent already has a child its parent turns out to be a branch which i gather you know ahead of could be a that connects two arcs may already know that this commit has multiple new commit has multiple parents merge may want to include the or commits in or it may make more sense to keep them either it be too difficult to build up this set of arcs you have these still left with trying to linearize in your the first algorithm described on the aforementioned sounds as you have a known set of branch points to use as your initial set commits should be first of you only have to care when you connect two either through a new merge a branch or combining two arcs into any given arc can easily maintain its current row number range fine with putting an arc on sequential so traversing up the tree checking that all new ancestors show up later should be pretty know enough to say much about drawing the graph but i imagine it be too different from what you do i hope that it was interesting to think at

so i suck at sql and i always have to ask for not sure what my disconnect is because i have any problem with programming c like here is my have a table full of tracking data for as specific course number i have added new tracking data for course number row of data is for one user for one so for users assigned to both course 6 and course 11 there are two rows of client wants all users who have completed course number 6 any time after august 1st 2008 to also have completion marked for course however i just convert the 6 to 11 because they want to preserve their old data for course for every row that has a course number of is marked as and is greater than the date august 1st i want to write the completion data over the row that contains the tracking for course 11 for that specific would need to carry over the data from the course 6 row to the course 11 row so things like user score and date of posted completion is moved is the structure of the values will be null and obviously be carried over as that is already in the right data from one existing row to another existing row in	
so if i understand all of the hardware is done your system has a command input that is a current level in amperes by say a double precision floating point number in and the output of the controller is a voltage that controls hardware that draws your plant is the circuit and the feedback is probably an 10 or 16 bit number either signed or unsigned depending on your your system looks like quickest and dirtiest approach is probably pid you can brush up on the basics with wikipedia and there are some hints on implementation in this a nutshell you want to compute the error of the system which in your example is the current command current make sure everything is in the same hopefully after your error is calculated you have to correct it with a in your system that is the voltage command to your current with the command is calculated by multiplying the the integral of the and the derivative of the error by gains and summing the the gains are the tricky the other tricky parts making sure your units are making sure the timing is and the correct your system you have many error is the command is which turns into then the current use is amps which is reported as volts which gets turned into either a signed or unsigned integer which has to be scaled back into amperes to make the error have lots of make sure you can keep track of what physical unit applies to control algorithm is hard and has to run at a dedicated i would recommend at least 100hz every electronic circuits move quickly not like electromechanical you may need a higher rate to stay on top of but it has to be hard real time that means you may not even be able to get away with software and derivative calculations are tricky but there are only so many ways to do the most basic algorithm is the rectangle rule dumb but it will probably if you need to be more precise use trapezoidal check the algorithms out most likely you use derivative control it tends to make things unstable and needed in most you ought to be fine with are lots of pitfalls but this should get you if had a background in control theory then it should all come back to once the framework is in place spend a lot of time tuning the proportional and integral gains the meat of the if this still seems like too much math for sorry this is about as simple as it gets for

software	
software development is a set of values and formulated by a group of the industry leading figures in is a concrete software development methodology that can be traced back to 1995 and was created by two of the original signatories of agile scrum supports agile early approach to software project management usually referred to as implies a sequence of clearly defined steps necessary to complete any execute and then represents a very simple and above all convenient abstraction from the project management theorist point of when one stage follows another it is possible to define clear inputs and outputs for each isolate and identify techniques and tools that are most useful at every this is a clear example of reductionism in tackling project management keep splitting the whole into smaller bits until you get to understand each bit in isolation and then hopefully you will master the mechanics of their as soon as the waterfall abstraction was presented it started to firstly it turned out that process can not be clearly cut into often definition is still changed on what it seems to be organisation or even execution in the stages were allowed to overlap and theoreticians started drawing all sorts of diagrams there possible to see how the definition stage gradually runs out as execution starts picking up during the organisation again only in it is possible to accurately estimate during the planning stage how long it is going to take to develop a piece of in actual the estimates and other plans have to be tweaked right through the execution phase which gave birth to a string of complex yet not very meaningful methods as value chronic problems with the waterfall abstraction gave birth to a number of project management methods xp programming that despite many differences at the more detailed level use the same fundamental principles to tackle product development project is organised as a number of small iterations through the classic project stages execution and iteration aims at a relatively small yet semantically complete increment in product functionality or involvement throughout the every iteration goes through a separate definition and planning stage the time horizon for various estimation and planning activities is greatly it helps achieve greater hence make it easier to access measure value and costs increments help controlling the evaluate utility of the changes and keep users involved since there is always a fresh version of fully functioning it is also much easier to organise a number of teams working on a large project simultaneously when increments are kept this really helps tackling task user feedback is key to iterative since it helps the product evolve gradually in a right direction providing greater utility at the end as opposed to the uncertainly of user reaction that is natural to driven by the waterfall

solution far right that the executionmode is what you want to use when wanting something to come out in the start or end mode of the which is part of what you then you say you want that script tag put out in the start mode of only the first tag used on the where you would use suggestion of the request unlike the default the request scope is shared among all custom tags on a given you proposed using the caller and that could unless the caller was another custom in which case the caller scope would only be the local scope in the custom the request scope has been around since about cf is your best that your proposed solution was in the custom in the start programatically check if you have already created a tracking variable in the request scope when you put the script tag out the first if put out the script tag and create the tracking than changing your code from using caller to also suggest want to put the cfset inside the no need to execute it again for when the if test

solve i ended up using the tupletopropertyresulttransformer and providing the list of property there are a few limitations to the main one being that the sql query must return the results in the same order as you provide your properties to the tupletopropertyresulttransformer the property types are inferred so you need to be careful with decimal columns returning only integer values apart from that using the tupletopropertyresulttransformer provided a reasonably easy way to use an sql query to return a collection of objects without explicitly mapping the objects within	
solved a very similar problem by using the drawinggroup and adding or removing drawing objects from the drawinggroup as they either needed to be displayed or the key is to organize your drawing objects in such a way that they are easy to manage and to understand how to add and remove them from the remember that you want to add and remove the drawing objexts from the so use and you will need to keep an external list of the drawing objects you to the drawinggroup to do this and used this technique to great effect by drawing an image into the first child in my instance of drawinggroup and then adding and removing drawing objects to this instance of drawinggroup in order to layer etc on top of the or on the image by adding or removing drawing objects to the instance of the the drawinggroup is treated as a single drawing and so any or other manipulations will affect all drawing objects within the

sounds to me like you are trying to do a rather than this kind of thing is usually tackled using event i did something similar in haskell a few years and rolled my own discrete event simulation library based on the continuation monad afraid its owned by my so i post but it too a continuation is effectively a suspended so define something like this sim r a contt r threadqueue io threadqueue tq sim r threadqueue inside the state holds the queue of currently scheduled you can also have other types of thread queue to hold threads that are not for instance in a semaphore on once you have semaphores you can build the equivalent of mvars and schedule a thread use the argument to is a function that itself takes a function as an this inner argument is the calling it resumes the when you do from that point of view just returned the value you gave as an argument to in practice you need to pass values back to the suspended so the parameter type is your argument to is a lambda function that takes and puts it on the end of whatever queue is appropriate for the action you are then it takes the head of the threadqueue from inside the state and calls you need to worry about this function it never

speaking with databases you rarely delete you can mark it as deleted but generally speaking you keep it in your database at least for a are many reasons for some of them are you may have requirements ot keep data for a given some of them are sometimes its just a you may need to restore the the user may request their account is reopened or it may have been locked due to spamming but that was because the account had been compromised and has now been data may be deleted or archived but this may take months or even i just give relevant data a status column 1 0 and then just change the status rather than delete it of the integrity is another issue let me give you an you have two want to delete a particular what do you do about messages sent and those messages will appear in someone inbox or sent items so you delete do you set the relevant field in message to that make a lot of sense either because that message did come from go even if they active better off just marking that user as deleted and keeping them it makes this and similar situations much easier to deal also mention forum threads and so you delete those either there are other reasons to do so such as spam or because content that is related to other content forum messages that have been replied only data you can safely and reasonably delete is child this is really the difference between aggregation and the user and message relationship above is an example of composition is house and you delete a house and all the rooms go rooms cannot exist without a this is composition in entity relationship a find more instances of aggregation than composition my so the question what do you do with that really hard to erase all traces of someone without deleting things you just mark them as locked or inactive and deal with it that

specific choice of threading model should be driven by the nature of the problem you are trying to there necessarily a single approach to designing the threading model for such an if we adopt the following arrive are independent and rely too heavily on shared is desirable to respond to an arriving message as quickly as want the app to scale well across processing architectures is the key design requirement more message at a faster to thread failure long operations is my the most effective threading architecture would be to employ a thread all messages arrive on a single multiple threads wait on the queue and process messages as they a thread pool implementation can model all three examples you single thread processes all messages thread pool with only one thread per n message types thread pool with n each thread peeks at the queue to find appropriate message multiple threads for all messages thread pool with multiple benefits of this design is that you can scale the number of threads in the thread in proportion to the processing environment or the message the number of threads can even scale at runtime to adapt to the realtime message load being are many good thread pooling libraries available for most including to your second whether to use standard windows message dispatch this mechanism comes with significant overhead and is really only intended for pumping messages through an windows ui unless this is the problem you are trying to i would advise against using it as a general message dispatching windows messages carry very little data it is not an each windows message has a and a this may not be enough to base a clean messaging model the windows message queue is not design to handle cases like queue thread or message these are cases that often arise in implementing a decent message queing	
specific community extension for joomla is are also extensions problem will be to find a combination which does what you want to an acceptable your customer is not satisfied and has musts which the solution provide you will have to start hacking the extensions or start writing hacking a joomla installation is not really a good idea since upgrading will become hard and a not upgraded joomla installation is a great security the end you might be better of developing your own joomla extension which does what you need it to or refrain from using joomla at more extensions you use at the same the harder maintenance of hacked code will pros and cons in is definitely one of the best cms but it always depends on your what tools you two websites can help with the choice a page where you can over a 100 open source cms and similar basically an extremely large feature comparison matrix of almost 1000 cms and similar software all price own experience was a when typo3 was strong among free cms but that time is the interface is clunky and typo3 has fallen far behind in the then there was a time when mambo became strong and later joomla split from mambo and became even but the code legacy of the joomla series was strongly flawed and a new player quickly took the cleaner clearer node based maybe for some too hard to in the same time when drupal got strong and the joomla series had serious security stories about hacked installations piled up and drupal had the pole position for some joomla is a completely different it has a few fantastic new features and in every upgrade more and more code follows mvc and other nice together with the enormous wealth of extensions design joomla definitely offers more options than any other open source had several extrem cases which i would do custom development where only joomla was able to fullfill all the needs for a there are also a few new names which have a great silverstripe for

sql you could do all sorts of fancy but google api is rather that you want all records to be no more than 1 minute just ask the database for all records less than 1 minute and then have python collate the results and reject the duplicate the data you show it looks like getting a couple of rows per per minute or so that approach should be sufficient even though its alternative would be to keep a second table with only the latest entry for each in it and cull that table every now and then to remove records over a minute	
standard approach in the webapp world is to split the key and put it in different you might split the key and put part of it in the filesystem of the part of it in the jndi configuration and part of it in the getting any single piece particularly hard if examining backup media or sql but getting all of the pieces will require a lot more can split a key by it with random numbers of the same a cryptographically strong random number you can repeat this process several times if you want to split the key into multiple at the end of the process you three partial keys such that p1 p2 p3 you might need to some of the partial keys so they can be stored in a jndi are more sophisticated ways to split a an algorithm where you require all of the pieces to recreate the but beyond what you need you can require the user to actively enter the there are pbe algorithms that convert a password to a good symmetric you want to find one that requires an external file as again a case the tape backups or the password itself you need you could also use this to split the password into two pieces with jndi you can use a plaintext passphrase in jndi and an initialization file somewhere in the whatever you do be sure you can your application fairly one approach is to use the password obtained above to decrypt another file that contains the actual encryption this makes it easy to change the password if you think been compromised without requiring a massive reencryption of all of the data just reencrypt your actual

standard library often has a similar feature set compared to the native library but there are several important is object whether you like it or the advantage of this is that certain concepts are easier to for most file related operations are found directly in the file compare this to where a file is a handle which is really just a an index into your open file the posix approach is very close to how the os actually implements but in java you see that or know it or has certain behaviours in certain there are many awt apis that are the way they are because awt needed to be identical on a number of separate that turned out to be and sun most of because supporting platform equally meant supporting every platform the newer implements almost everything in pure and thus is far better at and thus has a richer and that api is very different from the native windowing swing integrate too well because it uses so little of the native has certain limitations that the native libraries for you have function thus you have and and other java patterns for doing things that in would involve function so any api that needs one of these features will be significantly different in java than in the native in java often has libraries that offer similar behaviour to the native and sometimes offer completely different but best to think of java as a platform in its own sometimes you need advanced such as opengl or data in which case want a specific java api but most of the time you should evaluate java as its own

started testing reportbuilder quite a few years ago but i switched to fastreports a while ago and have been very happy with the of my requirements was that the reporting engine needed to be just one form of output columnar or similar but my framework needed to be able to output to this engine or an engine to produce filled in pdf forms or reports in excel format or other kinds of digital the reports have to be instances of a report superclass so that they can be combined and produced together as a package with multiple output types and am not an ace but i found the job could be done fastreports fits into this framework and does its job i say enough about the power and flexibility i have found by using firebird and i am just now starting to explore the possibilities of using its built in pascal scripting to integrate more completely with my main hope this is

submitted the question a couple of days but by continued research and after reading i think i have found an interesting white paper that i found very informative and comparison of the top four roger methodologies have come and gone in the last 20 at this perhaps 90 percent of the field use one of these four zachman framework for enterprise as a is actually more accurately defined as a taxonomy open group architectural framework called a is actually more accurately defined as a process federal enterprise be viewed as either an implemented enterprise architecture or a proscriptive methodology for creating an enterprise architecture gartner be best described as an enterprise architectural practice white paper discusses these four approaches to enterprise it does so within the context of a fictional company that is facing some very nonfictional operations these problems systems that have become unmanageably complex and increasingly costly to systems that are hindering the ability to respond to and market conditions in a timely and information that is consistently just plain culture of distrust between the business and technology sides of the white paper helped me in several gave me a good introduction and history of architecture architecture introduced me to what the author suggest is the 4 leading enterprise architectures then continues to compare them in a logical and simple manner with good examples that i could relate cannot say that all my questions have been answered and i am now ready to die but much has become clearer and thus i thought that someone else out there may also find this would still value any additional suggestions and questions you may have on this

subversion versions prior to merging subdirectories made later merges of the rest of the directory tree really you merged a svn simply applied all the changes made in that directory to the other if you had already merged a subdirectory and then tried to merge the main all the changes in the subdirectory were already in the target branch you merged them svn now know that these changes were from a previous it just saw that there were things the when it tried to merge the resulting in lots of avoid this you would have had to take care to only merge the directories that you merged making the whole process much more you had to remember exactly which revisions of which subdirectories you already had merged and only apply the remaining changes of the remaining this can get always merging the whole branch made this much current versions of subversion keep track of previous merges so that these problems can be subdirectories is no for svn this is just a global revision of the in that revision there will be only changes in one but for svn still a new version of the whole just like any other

suggest you zoom out and evaluate how the form process and user experience works before refactoring your is it necessary to give feedback to the user immediately when inputting can it wait until completed filling out the if you can just use a regular form validate the submission and return and the experience requires immediate you may want to look into creating a generic wrapper around your implementation to handle form this can be done or you can look around on google for form validation mechanisms that allow you define specific urls and per your third option could be to do the validation without contacting the determine whether your logic can be done in javascript if it involves date this be too and try to add a layer that does that for you so you need to contact the server in the first depending on how fast your server side code this could actually improve the user experience remember that validation is still a the example use case you gave in your it sounds like my former suggestion applies namely that not entirely necessary to be so immediate in your feedback on whether the form is being filled out if my understanding of your situation is i would advise starting the refactoring process by removing the ajax calls and having it work as a normal and then adding in validation once that

surprised that while people mentioned the logical array approach of indexing an nobody mentioned the find if x is an nxmxo works by generating an nxmxo logical array and using it to index x can be bad if you have large arrays and are looking for a small works by generating list of indices of x that satisfy and indexing x by should be used more than it in my what i would call can to arrays and cell arrays if you know the size by using end 1 with higher dimensions so long as the dimensions of the slice match so have to initialize x to something other than in that not good for numerics but for small dynamic lists of things cell parsing 1 2 1 2 3 think many people know is that for works on any dim 1 so to continue the for n means if all you need is the members of x you need to index also works with cell arrays but a bit annoying because as it walks them the element is still wrapped in a for el to get at the elements you have to subscript for el remember if there is a nicer way around

the answer is definitively to the first the halting problem does not prove in what suggesting proves the halting problem does not apply to real digital and used this very example as a proof of it a deterministic digital system a program running on real digital the number of possible states is and therefore all possible states are exact amount of memory required for the hash would state of initial initial state would be your hash and final state would be the hash and then have a pair for each initial an operating the state is gigabits of memory across all system such a general purpose program would require an impractical amount of memory to and would not be useful since the system is complex next user input depends on previous system is highly because if you index every possible initial state and associate it with the terminating you would effectively bring the running time of any program to any by zero i mean a very fast running time the time it takes to look up the terminating state it a starting from each of all possible will provide a kind of state map showing halting problem is therefore because there are only three four collapsing to possibilities given any possible initial program will reenter a previously encountered state the initial before exhausting all possible and therefore logically loops program reaches a state identified as before it has a chance to reenter a previously encountered state or exhaust all possible states the initial the simplest program will start from an initial will enter all possible states exactly and then has no choice but to halt or reenter a previously encountered state and loop i will reach roll over back to at which point it will have reentered the initial your index could be described like each initial there is exactly one or zero terminating other for each initial the program either reaches a terminating state a state already encountered since the initial state and cycles for any program running on digital it is often to determine all its states and whether it halts or loops practicality depends solely on how many valid initial states you have you can reduce with input and how feasible it is to take the time to run the program for each of them to termination and store the resulting state in the hash forcing any running time an other uses of capturing state include the function in game console emulators and the hibernate feature of computers not a perfect restoration of since some system memory must be used for the code that restores the state and some memory may never be stored gpu this proves is that any program can be represented by a hash program can be represented by an programs can be simplified to one big function with a massive

the biggest problems with anonymous types stem from the inability to name their that not possible to expilictly specify the type of an anonymous type as an expression in this really makes in awkward to do things like create a generic list new way to specify an ananymous you have to resort to a helper return new list also has a larger impact in that you use an anonymous type as a return makes casting extremely awkward a helper etc these are not the operations that anonymous types were designed in many ways they are designed to used within a particular defined function and subsequently created lambda not as a data communication type between to full fledged this is certainly a limitation in the design and at times drives me but overall i find them to be a very useful construct in the parts of linq would not be possible without them in some

the challenge here is because your application is meant to do a kind of task in a smart the very goal you hope to achieve is that the application becomes better than human beings at finding these and cool but if you pull it then it becomes very hard for any human beings to this the answer should be ideally the computer would i see why you think but consider these terabytes of information over have you read them based on i would argue that the answer should be if you really succeeded in your original the end user might sometimes that is a better you found a pattern that is going to make us save us or such a thing could never then why are you asking the computer to detect these kinds of patterns in the first the best thing i can think of is to let real life help you build up a list of test if there ever was a pattern discovered in the past that did turn out to be then make a that sees if your system discovers it when given similar i say in quotes because it may be more like an integration but you may still choose to use nunit or or rspec or whatever unit test tools some of these you might somehow try to the terabytes of data really mock the but at some higher level mock some of the conclusions reached from that for maybe you have a with some data in from which you expect a set of patterns to be if you can do it would be great if the system could its behind the patterns it this would let the business user deliberate over the question of whether the application was right or

the is textmate 2 still in or has it been is being actively if this text is still that is still the updated april allan stresses that no release is the allan has updated the textmate blog with on the past two posts on this blog have slowed to just a and a number of textmate users have asked about or publicly worried about its this blog the first written here in a long is an attempt to assuage those concerns and answer some of the most frequent textmate development is going textmate 2 done but progress is it is starting to take and the end is in the rewrite has been a slow and careful but the ideas behind it are i hope to publicly describe some new abstractions in the coming weeks and the community continues to churn out new bundles and features for textmate and been building up a backlog of posts describing while i am not writing to announce a release date for textmate i do hope that this post will be the first in a series showing a bit more requests for textmate 1 have mostly been incremental additions such as split chunked and editing over but textmate 2 is about more than new surface every part has been completely rewritten to take advantage of the lessons learned from the years of version not only are the data structures chosen for increased but the abstractions on which textmate is language been rethought and are more powerful than in the coming try to describe some of these new but for know that i am excited about the new ideas where does development stand for it feels to me like most of the modules are getting say but as they on the mountains look while i use for my own and the basic infrastructure is pretty much of the still needs and for now all lacking the spit and polish of a finished hopefully an alpha version will be ready before too but i make any promises about why i been better about keeping the world it is a combination of many things but the main issue is that i am not good at writing for a large i am more into informal for instance over mailing lists or on so while i started a lot of i end up unhappy with them halfway and they get finished or i am taking i have enlisted a technical writer to help bring this blog back to and try to communicate more of status and direction through than either of those problems as i is that textmate 2 is no minor a major undertaking with a long timeline and its final form fully i want to hype and i want to get hopes up before i know i can meet their i wanted to throw ideas onto the internet without having a chance to implement them humbled that textmate has served as inspiration for many other and i hope that it continues to be a model for other developers in the but i want to see my ideas done my way before i feed them to the am trying to slowly turn this with this i hopefully am showing that a hand is at the i know been quiet too long about my i make up for but going i aim to do the official blog saying the public alpha version will be release before christmas

the most part openmp and opencl are independent from each they are both ways of giving the developer access to parallelism on their is designed to work well with multiple where work that is approximately equal can be automatically farmed out between is a somewhat different in that it is really shines when working with special it will allow you to offload some of the number crunching to the gpu or some other like in the it was also built with the idea that it could be used to harness other main as are now common in i would consider this feature to be and if this is all you intend to use opencl i would not recommend using guess it would be somewhat though definitely not impossible to get openmp and opencl to work together in the same first thing to think about is what work giving to this would definately be a case where you would only want opencl to run on the on the other since openmp is alreay using it cause application errors to run opencl and openmp on the same main but it will cause scheduling where both the openmp and opencl run slower because they spend a good chunk of their time switching back and fourth between each this would also happen if you run any other process on the same core at the same other big thing to think about is how going to schedule tasks that do run on the its true that you can feed a lot of work into one of the modern but there are lots of things to think about with the pipeline and memory what you want to happen is to have 8 different openmp threads each trying to send their own work to the at the same i would recommend having only one thread that manages all the interactions with the so it can make sure to feed it work in an efficient sure there are programs that have multiple types of tasks happening at the same where one type of task could always be farmed out to the and another kind of task could be handled by the main this would be a fine example of a time to mix openmp and

the only makes sense in the context of its then it should be returned nested within its for in an element make sense as a sub resource on its if a resource can stand and you are going to want to manipulate a resource independent of any other then it should have its own that you can post or put to that resource without affecting other related and without having to parrot them back to the if you had to manipulate everything from the think about what happens if one person does a modifies one and then does a put of the whole thing with that what if someone else changed one of the others in the then you need to be adding locks and transactional which defeats the whole statelessness of get requests at it is likely to be a good idea to have some form of bulk query by which a client can get a large number of resources at having to do a new http request for each resource can take a long since it means a new round trip over the network for each it may make sense to have bulk update functionality as but if you are going to want to be able to manipulate one resource at a you need to provide a uri for that one perfectly fine to have more than one way to access you can think of it like a you can get stories on the main or on archive or by going to their if you want to to a bulk update without running into the problem of having one client give stale data to the you basically have two one client tells the server want a lock on this whole set of fetches the data it wants to modifies the sends it back to the and unlocks the client downloads the set of which is marked with some sort of revision tag which the server changes every time it gets new the client modifies and sends it back to the if any of the other data in the set has been modified in the the revision tag will be out of and the server will respond with a your data is out of try each have advantages and the problem with locking is that it is and so fit into a rest architecture very if the client program crashes or otherwise dies while it has the then that data will be permanently locked unless you have some kind of lock which can get locking can also lead to deadlock if the clients are doing some kind of fancy transactions that involve multiple problem with optimistic concurrency is that if there is a high load on a data with a lot of clients changing it at it can take many tries before a given client can post its in a slow client may end up being completely cut off from posting updates because other clients continually change the data in ways that mean that the slow clients changes always need to decide for yourself which of these options suit these issues also come up when changing a single resource update may clobber but when you aggregate resources into a bulk they are going to come up a lot more why i would recommend having two if going to aggregate one in which the resources can be accessed and an optional bulk interface where many resources can be read and written at

the other answers say about it being impossible to accurately predict the performance of code running on a modern cpu is but that mean the latencies are or that knowing them is exact latencies for intels and processors are listed in the manuals shown in can berk also has pdf manuals on their own website with the official tight knowing the latencies for each instruction can help a lot in manually trying to schedule your the programmer can make a lot of optimizations that the compiler the compiler guarantee it change the meaning of the this still requires you to know a lot of other details about the such as how deeply pipelined it how many instructions it can issue per number of execution units and so and of these numbers vary for different but you can often come up with a reasonable average that more or less works for all worth noting that it is a lot of work to optimize even a few lines of code at this and it is easy to make something that turns out to be a modern cpus are hugely and they try extremely hard to get good performance out of bad but there are also cases unable to handle or where you clever and making efficient and it turns out to slow the cpu in optimization table first column is instruction then there is a number of columns for latency for each the cpuid indicates which processor family the numbers apply and are explained elsewhere in the the latency specifies how many cycles it takes before the result of the instruction is so this is the number looking throughput columns show how many of this type of instructions can be executed per up xchg in this we see that depending on the cpu it takes and a mov takes looked up what each cpuid but i assume the are for pentium which ran some components of the chip at double allowing it to do things in half really see what you plan to use this information but if you know the exact cpu family the code is running then adding up the latency tells you the minimum number of cycles required to execute this sequence of

the others have you will want to connect to your database and then query the table that you have the data echo use instead of since the arrays are associative arrays indexed by but rather by names for displaying the update on the page that involves basically what that means is that your page will call out to a background script to get the new records from the this would require a new field in your something like that you could set to when it has been should check out this if you are interested in making an ajax chat	
the page is quite an old method and is generally a more expensive in terms of bandwidth than simply updating specific parts of your the solutions presented here already will do what you but you should also try looking into dynamic using not too hard to basically rather than the browser refreshing the entire you can use ajax to request only the data from the that needs updating on the are plenty of tutorials on if you need to support it can be just a tad more otherwise it is quite in an xmlhttprequest it a url that points to the data that needs updating on your page have to be the object a function that can process the data when it is the object to send the request to the server and retrieve the

the password file with something then it matter how the passwords are stored inside the use something like pgp for noticed that this answer has been downvoted before someone else upvoted and just thought i would clarify since i suspect the person that downvoted my answer actually read the on the other perhaps full encryption of the entire file is not possible for the person asking the this would be a handy clarification in the question if that is the the question specifically states that this is about the it also specifically states that this is not about storage and using a safe and secure encryption method for the entire file is really the best way to as then not limited to having to manipulate the file contents to try to mask each individual the whole file would be and if more than just the password file is to be it would be lumped together and thus encrypted together a lot more making the process of identifying the passwords nearly impossible as attacks on such encrypted files are a lot less likely to if you pick a reputable encryption algorithm and implementation than inventing something or at the very least making it easy for the attacker to find the individual passwords in small

the pools by table name or putting them in separate databases is about the same if you have lots of tables in one mysql has to load the table information and do a security check on all those tables when logging others separate databases will allow you to shift things around and create optimizations specific to a certain pool compressed it is extra admin but there is considerably more you can always the tables that are in separate databases by using federated or merge tables to simplify querying if for running out of primary you could always use a compound primary key if you are using myisam for if you have a field called groupcode and another called sequenceid and create your primary key as the sequenceid will increment based on the next unique id within the group code with large tables you have to be careful about caching and make sure the file system you are using handles large

the popular php frameworks today use their own view layer implementation that is based on pure php templates and lots of tried some of them and always found that this approach introduced huge complications to quite simple for in zend framework forms and the pagination use their own solutions to customize the look of these the helpers providing also quite slow and the whole view in my opinion does not exist as a one but many of its functionality is delegated to other parts of the the same configuration problems occured in symfony and admin and in kohana i was forced to duplicate the same code over all my is php really a good choice for the view do you also find these implementations inconvenient or why despite all these problems they are good and cannot be for example by a smart template engine mean smarty you find the view implementations in php frameworks

the wpf grid control is easy when your child elements are always contained within a single grid cell there is no a fixed width column stays the requested fixed an auto column will indeed size itself to be as wide as the widest cell in the star columns share any remainder space according to their relative star all is simple in the once you have a cell that spans two or more columns the width of the columns becomes more complicated to calculate and indeed seems here is a trivial example of what i we can define two columns with the first as auto and the second as fixed at 30 we define a button that spans both of the columns and happens to measure at 80 pixels my machine with my font and theme settings need to allocate the 80 pixels width of the button across the two spanning given the second column is fixed at 30 i would expect 30 to be allocated against that column and the remaining 50 go to the first because the first column is auto it seems the obvious thing to if you try this in practice you will find that the first column is 0 pixels and the second column has become the full even though that second column is defined as fixed and so should not be growing it as stretched to the full width of the maybe i am missing something here but that does not seem very logical to to my actual is there a full description of the logic used by the grid control for doing this calculations so that i can fully understand how it i have searched msdn and google and find nothing that describes how spanning elements affect the column know the algorithm used to size grid columns with spanning

them in and of itself i find myself using them less and less the more i a few reasons why i use am tempted to protected methods make a simpler api for any client the code is dangerous if used the code is dangerous if used the class or any of its the code is doing too avoid making any arguments as to whether protected methods are a good idea or but based on the above the amount of times that you protected methods all that in my more frequently a crutch than they are a all you have to do is inherit from the class to gain access to in most modern languages you even have to do that consider how much benefit getting from how many times have you accidentally called a method that supposed to be called outside its and if going to allow the method to be called by anyone and everyone who wants to inherit from your why you just make it if you want to control who can access a why not just leave it out of the you are exposing an interface rather than giving direct access to the not trying to side with your friend or make any kind of case against protected they have but you should think about whether you have a valid reason to make a method protected or whether creating them because what was drilled in your head in your programming for usually the

there are a couple ways to approach i would probably just use which should work just fine for your purposes long as the map is from rather than if you want to go through some it is possible to give a type for trait val class extends class extends class extends assuming that you were reading the json field into a scala field named you would give that field the following time you pull a field out of you would need to pattern checking whether the value was of type or two of once you have the inner you would then pattern match on to determine whether it represents an or you have to do this sort of pattern matching anyway in order to use the data once you pull it out of the advantage to the approach is the compiler will check you to ensure that you missed any the disadvantage is that you just skip impossibilities mapping to an there is some overhead imposed by all of these wrapper so watch out for that scala does allow you to define a type alias which should cut down on the amount of loc required for a few implicit conversions to make the api and you should be all nice and

thing i really like about aop is that it is really easy to move between a development and production you can create very verbose logging and then basically flip an xml switch and	
thing that comes to one could track execution time of the queries and if it passes some threshold which is considered normal it gets logged along with some profiling information is discarded might also be feasible to profile individual parts of the query data acquisition from logic and so then again compare the times against some pitfall is that some are bound to be processed significantly longer then others because of the difference in the amount of they one would have to keep a whole lot of averages for different parts of the site different types of queries in order to get rid of constant flow of normal queries that execute longer by is a very simple approach sure there are better ways to do	
thing to keep in mind about recaptcha is that they are images actually scanned from real books and as such you have to be aware that funky punctuation and stuff can make it not just for example seen partial words that end in a hyphen obviously occurred on the end of a as well as numbers find if you bear in mind the origin it makes a heck of a lot more sense and is easier to you only need to get one of the recaptcha words because the other is used to aid in the however you know which is	
thing to keep in mind is that if importing alot of data into this you may find out that things like are not as unique as you and there may be operational roadblocks to fixing the problem road	
thing to note about answer with multiple in one can be rather dangerous for really large amounts of because most dbms have an upper limit on the size of the commands they can if you exceed that with too many your insert will on mysql for example the limit is usually 1mb you should figure out what the maximum size is at might be available from the database and make sure you exceed it by spreading your lists of values over several	
thing to remember is that at core visual like any is a glorified text editor with an integrated and maybe a few other features as you could certainly use visual studio 2005 to input the code text of your linq program and then use the command line compiler to build you might even be able to find or write an to automate the build means the technically correct answer to your question you get extra ide syntax to work with solution debugger result is that you would probably be better served if i had simply you already have 2005 but not you have a few the 2008 express a tool like a 2008 full	
thing you should know about addresses is that you are providing a not a is an implementation and the you are specifying can be will all regardless of any other just the unique identifier for that named the network stack is not involved with this form of

things have already been but i think one should also that there are some programming that differ from oop and for those tuples are quite programming languages like haskell for example have classes at	
things to keep in try anything expect it to work under mono first is really good at the things that you do every like manipulating strings and displaying web really bad at things that need to use the little hidden corners of the runtime for instance is still implemented at and even some of that actually mono is not a silver

think a better approach would be to handle the onbeforenavigate and ondocumentcomplete events that the webbrowser control set a timer in onbeforenavigate and stop it in now you are which is never a good	
think a bit of a problem in because filesystems have not supported this kind of behavior people written programs to use and because people written programs to use little incentive for filesystems to support could always write your own filesystem to do or maybe modify an existing one filesystems used the are probably pretty you might have an easier time starting from if people find it useful enough it might catch on

think at the first you should bind the constructed object from the second as first parameter of the method should be the address of the constructed try to compile the one other possible issue is that the second bind functor might return the constructed object by and the first bind requires a pointer to object this so you still need a pointer as first bound parameter for	
think bad design to put security logic in the you put business logic there and you could arguably view security logic as a sort of business you certainly want it all in the controller or the you want to follow the fat models should stand alone as a cohesive chunk of application you should be able to completely drive your models from the rails having security logic in the model makes it easier to unit

think doable with could try to stop using the controller hierarchy classes which is about to be deprecated anyway and take a look at annotation based controllers introduced with spring they allow a much more flexible form be put off if you like although none of the examples really make it you can use annotation driven controllers and define all beans in an xml

think it makes more sense to say a refactor can be better than a after all if you are rewriting it means you are throwing at that point you are basically flipping a coin as to the bugs you will enter in all the new if you are porting you can often just wrap some chunk of code in a library wrapper and make it available to the software if you reuse then you are just wasting time doing the same thing refactoring your system in treating each interface as a library or service that can be swapped out can often have vast leaps and bounds in terms of performance and	
think it really matter that much in which programming language and environment you as long as you get to know it java and all have good libraries and all have their strengths and the important thing is that you know the peculiarities of the the development the a good the standard the best third party after a while you can reuse your own code as for you mention an advanced tree in our we have our own tree which we can finetune as we

think it would be more correct to say that the question of whether the strategies must be deterministically identical is outside the scope of the definition of the strategy a function always returns the same result for given it is if two functions are deterministic and they always return the same value for the same inputs then they are deterministically they may or may not have the same side if they do then they are just plain this is not the let us consider an example that appears to require deterministic you might think that if two comparer implementations fail to return the same result for the same inputs then at least one of them must be but this is not necessarily the orders vary between some places sort some put mcduck with and so these are this is a perfect application of strategy and the strategies are most certainly deterministically

think markusq has the but let me develop an alternative that you may find easier to use my of developing this as a series of simple transformations in an analogue of in a procedural put everything in common recall that column is seconds since the midnight 1 january we can find the number of seconds since midnight of the day of the that call by just taking s modulus the number of seconds in a 60 60 as 60 dur 1 as subtract one from because a one second call that starts at also ends on can find minutes since midnight by dividing those results by or just by s 60 view s 60 as s dur 60 as we create a table of we need 1440 of numbered from 0 to in databases that support arbitrary i an artificial range or like create table id int not null primary key idz insert into values repeat next line to double insert into select idz from to create a create view minute as select id 1 as from where id we just join to our record view from minutes a just cross record so we have one record row for each whole minute over which the call was that doing this by defining active as the call occurred during a that a two second call that starts at and ends at by this definition occurs during two different but a two second call that starts at and ends at occurs during one did that because you specified i need a way to check for a count of active calls for if you prefer to consider only calls lasting more than sixty seconds to occur in more than one need to adjust the if we want to find the number of active records for any granularity equal to or larger than minute we just group on that last to find average calls per hour we divide by 60 to turn minutes to select 60 as 60 as from group by 60 that that is the average per hour for over all if we want to limit it to a particular day or range of add a we create a version of that does a left outer we can get a report that shows the average over all hours in the create view select from minutes a left outer join on and we again do our but against the new select 60 as 60 as from group by 60 hour 0 1 2 3 can also index into this with a the join means have null values for the underlying table where no calls exist for a particular select 60 as 60 as from where 1 and 2008 group by 60 bring back no rows for hours in which no calls if we still want our view that shows all we make sure we also include those hours with no select 60 as 60 as from where 1 and or date is null group by 60 that in the last two using a sql date which the functions and can be not the date in your record brings up another both the date and time in your record table are superfluous and as each can be derived from your column leaving them in the table allows the possibility of inconsistent in which or prefer to do it like create table record id int not null primary create view as select as from the the is an enumerated type that tells the function to add is the column in	
think me if insert or replace is in any of the sql an there is but that supported by all dialects so not available in general cleanest solution is to use as suggested by you could also use savepoints to an except then rollback and do an update a third solution is to write your insert with an outer join and a where clause that filters on the rows with	
think nick has the right it sounds like you are performing your search and populating your listview in your onclick method for your search you need to perform your search preferably cache the data the first time and bind that to the listview for each new page that is requested using the can do this fairly easily by creating a method for the onpagepropertieschanged perform the search pull from the and bind the listview in that onpagepropertieschanged event and your data should your code might look like void eventargs void your void eventargs

think of a reason why float would be better than make sense if either worried about copies being made is irrelevant with a primitive type like or you want to be able to update a value across all instances that share the reference is irrelevant with top of references in members are a huge pain in the when it comes to and so have to offer a significant advantage of the alternatives in order to be and clearly not the case with the on is always amusing and thought

think that any commonly used hash function will do what you want provide a unique representation of an the problem you are trying to my solution would be to have a backend table that records all not the changes but an identifier of the rows that have on a periodic basis callback to the server and get a list of all the objects that have and use this to decide on the client which rows need

think that referencing when is since wpf is still a relatively new it just have complete feature parity with winforms for to my knowledge none of the standard windows dialogs save browse for have been implemented in wpf the only way to display these in a wpf application is to use the winforms or use to display the win32 versions i go with the winforms version since they already took the trouble of wrapping the win32 approach is to use wpf as much as and only fallback to winforms if wpf fill my hopefully over the next release or so of wpf this will become less and less

think the pattern best for your situation is your have to know what class sending this data you would implement a logincontrollerdelegate in your you would implement a property like id when actually got something to communicate to the you would write object that should receive the login ids would incorporate the protocol like someotherclass nsobject you would implement the method in instead of your needing to have intimate knowledge of the other classes in your you simply establish a mechanism for sending that data to whatever object is interested in it when it becomes if you later change which object should receive the login you only need to choose a different

think the problem is that they estimate the number of steps so much as that often the wrong definition of is in your example of the installer going from 0 to in 10 seconds and then an hour for the seen that happen when the programmer decided to count the number of files to not the number of there were 10 9 of them were 5k each and the last was a 2gig the first 9 would copy really fast and the last would be counting files was the wrong thing to should have counted problem if you want to count bytes then you need to implement your own copy routine so you can provide status updates during the copy of the large is is really worth it to implement your own copy other problem is that an install many other is made up of stacks of routines that can be quite these routines can do a lot of but likely generic and have nothing in them that is capable of updating some progress meter at a much higher need to reimplement a number of common routines to get good progress for a robust i think that would be really the particular steps could be defined in a config but need to have progress updates from every part of the install the time to do these things would obviously vary from machine to so likely be way off of once done the install on a specific machine you could likely estimate the install on that machine next

think the solution for my needs is to add an identity the one thing i can guarantee is that the ordering will be such that entries that should will be added first never add one with identifier then go back and add bbba if i have that obviously it but as it i can just order by the identity column and get the sort i keep thinking about the other suggestions maybe if they in my look like a better	
think the stride size and row number limits can be calculated in i precalculated all resulting in the following static unsafe void bitmapdata point it is expected that the bitmap pixelformat is format24bpprgb but this could change in the const int pixelsize calculate total number of rows to var totalrow var rowsize starting point of copy srcptr destptr loop through each for i i draw the entire for j j advance each pointer by 1 destptr srcptr tested it thoroughly but you should be able to get that to have removed multiplication operations from the loop and removed most branchings so it should be somewhat me know if this helps	
think the typical approach to this is just to ask the if you feel confidant that your users will provide an accurate i suspect have to write an application that runs a speed test on the typically these record how long it takes the client to receive x number of and use that to determine 3 has a library to help you with this but i believe it requires you to deploy your app on flash media see native bandwidth for	
think there are going to be issues with this other than a little bit of performance penalty for having a primary key larger than a usual 4 bytes do you need a uuid as your primary why you just use a surrogated integer key with a	
think there are many gotchas to this approach over the usual problems of running a script from a compiled i find the biggest problems tend to be people from moving the sure people add hidden dependencies in the script that are not reflected in the calling i do think you should consider another model for your instead of having a program reference a why not add all of the logic into a compiled this can be easily linked into the program and exposed to powershell via a i find this is an easier way to maintain shared code between scripts in	
think there is a think of ms cab files as archives like now it is possible to put anything in such an like your but i think you mentioned that python since you want it otherwise just use an archiver like no need to use i am right then you first need to convert your script into an executable using something like or	
think there is any way to expose undefined enums using a propagating you might try enabling see the for i usually do is implement an ierrorhandler that logs exceptions and promotes exceptions to faults there is some good stuff on web	
think this actually has more to do with type inference than with the params the inference engine assumes on the third line that the type of t is and therefore passes it to the first if you believe	
think this can also do the trick it do it imho for html file a web page monitor with google docs and track changes	
think this is a common case of pattern you check your two they do exactly the same the only thing that changes is the keep things dry and overuse this pattern any here you gain a little bit of but then you also have 2 classes that pull their and probably gonna that is common when you learn a new technology or you want to apply it everywhere happens to every one of even if doing it harms the code readability and keep it response to the author comment on my did not try to make fun of or this is a common i did it many and learned it the hard not only with patterns but also with fancy new buzzword you name authors of the book themselves warn the readers not to overuse and the upvotes in this answer clearly indicate something if for some reason you still want to implement the my humble a superclass for both this superclass would be abstract and should contain the shared rate value of their child strategies and implement the abstract method in each subclass see that both methods are the but to make each concrete strategy always favor immutability as joshua bloch for remove the setter of provincialtaxrate and specify the value on constructor or directly in its create some static factory methods in the strategysuperclass so that you decouple your clients from the implementations or concrete strategies can very well be protected classes a pastie with some code to make the solution a bit more it	
think this is a matter of i prefer to use anonymous classes for but in your use an inner since i think be packing more than just a few lines of code in perhaps more than just a and it would emphasise the fact that adding functionality to the by putting it inside the rather than hidden somewhere in a who maybe someday you might need the subclass else of depends on how much you know about how your software will other than just flip a vajna	
think this is exactly what looking but its what got bash rm	
think this is pretty efficient and though you could use to avoid the many i agree with ross on the dictionary idea for larger	
think this is the easiest way to print this is using or you could create a print the stack and go from	
think this is what you looking for automatically resizes flash to width and when your browser is greater than the minimum size and resizes flash to the desired size when the browser is it can also resize flash movie to a maximum size if browser window size is greater the maximum	
think this should but it assumes the image has an alpha if you try and load an image without an alpha channel you will get an exception or your application might for channel images use instead of on the second right before setting the	
think this should not be treated as a see cocreateinstance fails in rpc this one too to register multiple rpc server there is problem in the release of see examples of implementation of and check your input pipes on the output pipes on the input pipes on the output pipes on the	
think this type of code is written who have misunderstood the concept of references and use it for everything including primitive data also seen some code like this and see any benefit of doing	
think this will answer both you can control the way your ads are being transferred to if you want that to you can add the following method to your class implementing return the ad will be displayed on an internal browser instead of launching safari to do	
think tied to euclidean distance as you can probably use manhattan distance but pretty sure tied to geometries that can be represented in cartesian so you use a to index a metric for	
think to answer this question we would need to know about the architecture of your entire program or whatever the case may answer it there are a number of strategies you can others have pointed on a modern desktop or server operating you can and not worry about the memory your program has strategy for if you are developing on an embedded operating system where might not clean everything typically what i see is when individual functions return due to an they make sure to clean up anything they themselves have you see any calls after 10 each function would in turn indicate an error when it and each function would clean up after the original function you will it might not be called would detect the clean up any memory it had and take the appropriate you just have not rocket where it gets difficult is if you have multiple threads of and shared data then you might need a garbage collector or a way to count references and free the memory when the last user of the structure is done with for if you look at the source to the bsd networking see that it uses a value in some structures that need to be kept for an extended period of time and shared among different is basically what garbage collectors as	
think what looking for is tested with flash and textfield and it	
think what swfobject allows you to do is to write the flashvars into the embed with the same result as if you were to hardcode the flashvars i think trying to change the hardcoded parts in your manner would be very similar to trying to change the flashvars during after the swf has already firefox may well be loading the swf once it hits the not giving the javascript a chance to change the read up on that might be cool if you are compiling the swfs	
think what you want is the attribute on your which takes an optional path to an error handler the default is you could add additional support for your specific exception	
think what you want is to separate the males and females into different data you can go this in the chart as long as you have enough information in your data your data set looks something like date sex count m 124 f 78 m 95 f 101 if you have the date as the count as the and add the sex as the series the it should automatically split them into two graph and add a legend	
think what you want to do is pass an arbitrary number of i think what you have here is a case where you have multiple types of in your passing a but you also mention sometimes pass an so it seems to me what you really want to do is declare your callback to take a and a flag to indicate what it something int switch case list case ele passing things as a the list should know the so you have to worry about passing you could define multiple types of callback and always callback the right one based on what sort of processing you need to not restrained to straight c you can use you may investigate using as it is very useful for this sort of	
think with the first approach you are not tying your design down in any you could load services and easily add new services in the future there is no code binding to the exact service type as in the second	
think wrapping your statics and providing access via singletons at a minimum via static is generally a good since you can better control access and avoid some race condition and synchronization	
think you are looking for like in that you specify the number of in but it require that you have a notion of the objects clustering like every cluster has a representative which is the member of the cluster closest to the you could think of it as a version of that finds instead of all you need is a distance metric to cluster and used this in some of my own work for exactly the same reasons you is not the fastest but there are fast variants that are probably good enough for your here are descriptions of the algorithms and links to the documentation for their implementations in is the basic implementation of is a much sampled version of it works by clustering randomly sampled subset of objects with pam and grouping the entire set of objects based on the you should still be able to get very good clusterings fast with you need more a that gives an overview of these and other	
think you are looking for something like obviously you will need to change table names and fields to match your from ul where not in select from	
think you are looking for the it is not quite as awesome as so you have to give it a format mask to select your i think the mask would be depending on whether or not you are expecting month names and based on your example it could be select 30 2006 30 2006 row in set out the reference for the mask	
think you are right creating a new table just to store the unique paths may actually take more space than leaving the duplicated data in the original plus it complicates the queries and this depends on the amount of duplicates of	
think you are thinking about this in the wrong you be the error simply to log it further down the the cannonical way of doing this in python is to use the logging adapted from the bad display message raise gives a far more flexible logging system than relying on errors produced on you may not need to the exception if you can recover from the exception in some	
think you can deploy a windows service via clickonce in a normal	
think you can detect in the sense of having some sort of kind of but you could consider having different base classes for those pages that are loaded in an iframe and those that so that you can know the error is from a request that was for an iframe page that may help to some	
think you can do that by but you can do something you go to the select you pick your for example check the for you get a message about a class not existing and being generated at runtime you press and when you define your dynamic you do the new you only need to define the textformat if no differences in size or other attributes the applies for the text already in the whereas the applies for the text going to be added from that point on to the should do the tested in flash	
think you can do to my knowledge there is now way to programatically disable the toolbars or any of the features you are and it is certainly the wrong way of providing security to a maybe you should look at alternative a general rule of if someone can see it on their they can duplicate	
think you can to this by using the option to and the option to both cases they allow you to replace the default prefix used on the functions generated with a prefix of your own	
think you could also do something like and and put this at the end of the onload or call it stringbuilder sb new stringwriter sw new htmltextwriter htmltw new not sure if there are any potential issues with but it looks like it would this you could use a full featured instead of the maildefinition class which only supports text	
think you could also use the allows you to parse querying the html tree using xpath or via iterators and the tree with a save method when on your you might just create an adapter around the because it only works on an entire html document and you want it on elements but this should be not too	
think you could look around and find but whether or not followed is an entirely different is open source software it costs you nothing to but afraid going to have to invest some time to determine if a package does what you relatively straightforward to determine how recently a gem has been released and how many times and with what frequency updates have these are indicators that the source is being actively maintained and that effort is going into its continuing you can also look at tests installed with the existence of bug tracking discussion groups or forums and the like in order to assess the degree of commitment from the and the amount of penetration and community around the what were you hoping value for some central authority that accredits the fitness for purpose of a it going to happen any time and on no bad	
think you have answered your own as is a nice clean if you alias types you get a clean output after that it matter which soap stack you use so long as it is nice and interoperable with	
think you have not yet tried out its opensource but seem to have	
think you have to save in the transition if the effect you activerecord aasm is sitting on top autosave by can do the saving in a if you want it sounds like you	
think you mean next hop instead of the the next host can be checked from the route with traceroute it can be implemented as following stackoverflow	
think you might want to be more specific a singleton to control the db connection in your web a object will be thread but your may want to pool so you should go to a single instance of it to share the	
think you misunderstand the purpose of a as the name defines a structure where of its members occupy the same memory whereas a places each of its members in separate memory in a contiguous your when you and will both be this is because and are stored the same memory each member of a union is a different of the same this does not happen with a because all of the members are distinct and separate from each is no way around this behavior	
think you need a domain model similar to the buyer details seller details book details it works is that a user or can create a bid or offer as so if you are a buyer you may start by searching through the offers if you like one you may choose to accept it and proceed to perhaps you quite like any of the offers but one is close in price to what you you might create a bid and have that sent to the creator of the offer to if nothing is close to your requirements as a buyer you may create a bid and leave it in the system for potential sellers to and consider till time of expiry you have have added the bid and offer classes and i think their benefit is self but if you would like some further explanation please feel free to leave a comment and i will the expiry fields are not necessary but most likely every bid and offer will have a time limit in which case you will need have increased the number of but i think you will find that your system becomes much easier to manage and	
think you need to change the signature of the look up using the backgroundworker not just for wpf but also for the winform async	
think you need to form found next topics about this there a control which emulates excel functionality but is not web server control that generates html and much more with tags think the best implementation would be has a number of	
think you need to put in the create action since using and not you need to pass an object to the current you use and your object will vanish when the current action is set via now are accessed the same way as standard	
think you need to quantify what means to that is an ambiguous term and can mean alot of you mean something like syntax there is no exact equivalent for a powershell with powershell not sure there is anything in v2 for that description you give makes it sound like you want something more than just a it type like rossell that is not trivial and is highly specific to what you are previous mentioned methods in the other answers only work for powershell not they show what that cmdlet would not a syntax	
think you read it wrong to some dense the article talks about using fibonacci heaps with time complexity v log which is significantly	
think you should ask the other way when should you not use floating for most numerical floating point is the preferred data as you can forget about overflow and other kind of problems typically encountered with integer way to look at floating point data type is that the precision is independent of the that is whether the number is very small of very big an acceptable range of the number of meaningful digits is approximately the drawback is that floating point numbers have some surprising like x x can be false x is they do not follow most mathematical rules that is y depending on the values for and this can	
think you should never implement things you or are not sure you are going to need them or if it add value to your put it if you like to keep your tests in synch with your and use them to show use cases of your then you have anything that is not covered by those this includes problem i other than a possible waste of is that it would confuse someone who reads the does this class have equals is it some data can it be a part of a does it even make sense to compare instances of this say only implement these when you actually need therefore i say that i implement this and that perhaps would be the method that i write the because usefulness appears a lot in vajna	
think you should register your new database with sql server registration tool	
think you want instead of since you want it associated with a particular field in your show	
think you want to call on the block	
think you want to combine both those lines into run looking at your posts and it seems you want to log the compilation the command for that will be something like on one a file called command been using so far is designed to simply open an interface where you can type which is why you get no if you want to log or a kernel there is a file called which describes the command line including in full are you really using a nant script to call a to call a to call sure a simpler way to do	
think you want to use i believe the was deprecated and removed between 9i and	
think you want to use the indirect function to lookup the value of a rather than define a lookup range directly in the data have a look at which explains it fairly warned though that multiple cascading validations like this have particular problems of their if you make a second third then go back and edit the first there is no automatic flag to say that the selection may now be for if you have the then change the first you may now have a finding such inconsistencies can be very or requires some code to the ddoe blog shows one method to highlight such errors using conditional but this is very calculation intensive and scale aware that multiple lookups of this nature can bring a workbook to its knees if used even without using conditional in for a small project where data entry is tightly controlled this is a flexible method of cascading drop down but if you have little control over the or if the data collected will grow past a few hundreds lines then probably want to look at validating the validation using or just going the whole hog and forcing entry through a which is by far the best if the data absolutely has to stay the way it then an advanced filter which creates the named ranges used in the validation would be at this level of complexity though surely be better off just using a form for data	
think you want to use the namepsace the batterylevel batterystate for the full code	
think your algorithm cannot be optimal because it makes no use of any measure of you use other metrics like and checking for drive a wedge between yours and an optimal we need to exploit that gap by looking for shapes with close vertices which would decompose for example the i found this on the polygon which forms a g or u have no protection against the point being connected across the concave which is to the algorithm is also quite and may be overdoing it just like complex you may find bugs in it because complex code makes complex a more extensive initial stage to break the shape into simpler shapes like triangles and then an iterative or genetic algorithm to recombine you will need a stage like this to combine any unnecessary divisions between your convex polys and by then you may have limited your possible decompositions to only a guess something into generate a number of a quality metric of the best of the decompose each using and generate a new set of from 4 until some measure of convergence is	
think your approach is too parsing an html by using regular expressions might be much more difficult than you would suggest you to take a at this	
think your best answer comes from the user is there any of the customer and supplier information that is maintained in by the same users the same if easier for them if they can change information in one place for both if got them changing each which will not make anyone issues arise if you have separate purchasing and sales and need to interface to or have an enterprise system which case you should probably match what it are you deriving your requirements from use cases or user stories or	
think your code is but taking in the width and the height as parameters is where going wrong in my why should the caller of this method have to decide how big they want the width and the i would suggest changing it to a bool string imageformat int using img int width int height image thumbnail new graphics g rectangle rect new return catch return	
think your focus should be on the object and not on the event for example you have the object eventargs e performactions did something to the effect as as inside the person you would expect to see something to the effect inationality get return set if point here is that you let the object keep track of what is happening to not the this also lets you keep track of dirty flag tracking on your which could be useful for persistence later also keeps your ui clean and keeps it from getting odd event registration code that will most likely be error	
think your issue has anything to do with the transactionscope it sounds like describing the expected behavior of sql server changing the isolation level only affects not from sql server a transaction isolation level does not affect the locks acquired to protect data a transaction always gets an exclusive lock on any data it and holds that lock until the transaction regardless of the isolation level set for that for read transaction isolation levels primarily define the level of protection from the effects of modifications made by other that means is that you can prevent the blocking behavior by changing the isolation level the issuing the the isolation level prevent to prevent blocking the you would use the isolation but you would have to account for the possibility that records may be retrieved that have been by an open transaction they might go away if the transaction rolls

think your problem is not a call to pure virtual function can never allow that so it really cause a runtime but that you are calling the function on an invalid memory area that therefore has an invalid virtual am also willing to bet that this may have something to do with how you construct your as automatic variables rather than dynamically allocating as soon as you get out of those that memory is	
think your second attempt is on the right except instead of you should try

thinking about this for a i came to the conclusion that probably a bad idea to do asynchronous events in windows forms windows forms events should be raised on the ui doing otherwise presents an undue burden on and possibly makes a mess with objects and asynchronous cleaner to let the clients fire off their own asynchronous processing or some other or handle the event are of for raises the event on a thread pool but the initial notification comes in on a pool it looks like the general rule raise the events on the same thread that got the initial at the rule that works best for that way no question about leaking

third party provided me a static lib to link with on solaris tried to compile with and failed at link suppose the issue is coming from the compiler i use or simply its version the std lib provided by the compiler could change from the version expected by the library afaik it could leads to errors at link could i know which compiler was used to generate this is there some tools doing some option in or an read some time ago that compilers use different mangling conventions when generating object files command line prints me well all function names from debug symbols in this static how does it work if my assumption is does have a way to resolve which convention is in use in a static or is it simply meaning that lib was generated by gnu as nm is a part of gnu binutils am not close to my workstation so i error output from the linker for the moment but i could copy them in a further there a way to know which compiler generated a static

this about the possibility of someone malicious altering your code to do something you program it to or is it about the possibility of random errors messing up your in the latter you probably have to worry because the error rates on modern computers are something like 1 in less than one per processor per and if even that is intolerable you can use algorithms to reduce the effective error rate as close to zero as you want the cost of needing more time to do a given hackers worried really no expectation of security at someone in physical control of a computer in modify it to do absolutely anything that can conceivably be done by a they could disassemble your code and alter assembly instructions at if they to make your program behave however they want it we usually worry about this in because most of us writing anything worth the effort to those who programmers designing military encryption hardware or nuclear missile control can fall back on hardware which makes it extremely difficult to alter the stuff can be might want to take a look at a book called by ross which describes some of this and in general how people who need to secure their code can do

this apply to my present sure all been there a java developer been asked to develop an app in or a developer asked to do something in or a php developer with the opportunity to do a rails or django if a competent these sorts of platform shifts really be a given enough you can expect to become as proficient as you were on your old if this is a freelance project for a does it seem at all unethical to be learning this platform on their assuming said client give you an unlimited amount of time to finish the there are going to be compromises and possible quality issues due to your you have to start somewhere and not everyone has the luxury of spare time to tinker with new sometimes its necessary to just bite the bullet try and plan things intelligently and just get it done and get this seem would accepting a lower rate make it more of billing for work done on a platform you just started

this code is keep it this problem with storing the return value of a function in a reference is that you are not allocating the space to actually store the return so you often end up with a reference pointing to a temporary either the temporary return value of the function created by the or a local variable allocated during the function freed at its is true that you must not return a reference on a local variable because this variable will be freed when the function the standard states that the compiler must not free the temporary return value of a function if it is so if your function is returning a float by you can store this value in float the compiler ensures that the actual temporary value returned by the function will not be freed until you are done with your that this behaviour is only valid for references a look at this for more	
this code it seems like it then the only issue i sense seeing is that you feel this code be in the ui well you have many options as you kinda need the dgv in order to properly build up the xml file based on currently visible in the if using say put this in a seperate class as an extension method to the datagridview something static class public static void datagridview string if not using then just have a static class anyway with a similiar but actually pass in the dgv something static class public static void string third and i personally do it this is to create a new datatable based on currently visible on the and call writexml method on that

this is a major undertaking which will involve lots of my advise would be to treat it like a very long term a clear goal in which addresses major issues like maintainability and the future of your this has been agreed by the stake develop a prototype system to test your assumptions where you can try out vrs or mvc vrs would assign your best developers for start with one your small legacy and build the core components which you will in other this start with your more senior but everyone must get involved and be familiar with the new will ensure everyone is trained at the same and no one is left on how many applications you have i would rotate so all systems can all new work must be done in your language not in convert each one of your legacy would only convert them if they are changing or if there is a clear benefit to updating should give you a solid framework to use going while still ensuring users functionality hindered by your worked at a company which had roughly 40 or so vb time we have migrated all of these to and now years we have roughly 150 applications in all share a common making them easy to and extend where

this is a the important thing to be aware of is that the underlying tcp protocol does not maintain any segment that when you call multiple all of the data you sent may very easily be returned by a single call at the other the data sent in one call may be returned in multiple at the other if some packets got delayed due to network this is fundamental to the design of and your application must be designed as noted by the call returns the number of bytes that were read off the anything after that point in the buffer is and the data is not socket uses udp which is entirely as opposed to like udp does not guarantee reliability u stands for so you have to handle packets this is a lot harder than	
this is certainly possible using very and prone to concurrency best bet is to analyze the spreadsheet calculations and duplicate your business is not going to like the time it takes to do but it will give them a more usable you can simply serve up the spreadsheet to users from your in which case you do almost if your stakeholders really insist on using excel i suggest you take a good hard look at excel services as it may not get you you but get you quite a and should solve some of the issues end up with trying to do it with not to say that a your mileage will certainly and sharepoint exactly cheap to buy or in costs could easily be dwarfed by costs if you go the sharepoint it might the best option to fit a still suggest you push back in favor of coding all of your logic in a separate that way you can use it both excel can easily pass calculations to a com and you can very easily publish your library as com in the have a much more maintainable and usable

this is referred to as and a property on all container to do what you looking you can use a creation policy of is the creationpolicy of means that the container delays creating some or all descendants until they are a process which is known as deferred this policy produces the best startup time because fewer uicomponents are created this introduces navigation delays when a user navigates to other parts of the application for the first navigator containers such as and viewstack implement the policy by creating all their children but wait to create the deeper descendants of a child until it becomes the selected child of the navigator creationpolicy of means that the navigator containers immediately create deeper descendants for each rather than waiting until that child is for containers such as a vbox there is no difference between the and info careful with this flex picked auto as the default for a if your app grows the initialization time under will be

thought i would ask this question to see why many examples and people prefer to use inline databinding in the aspx code vs implementing an ondatabinding event when using any control i always implement the ondatabinding method for field level controls if i need to do anything that built in out of the box i need to do an most examples i see have the code right in the aspx page using the inline of inline of how i prefer to do the the codebehind void literal lit personally prefer the codebehind method because it keeps my aspx pages clean and i have all this inline code all over the place and the next guy just knows to always look in the files for code the seperation of presentation and code is also maintained better this way as the html is place holders only and the codebind is determining what is actually being put in these are very basic the field could be a integer that you want to format with leading 0s or a datetime that needs a specific format it could also take all sort of manipulation and code to get the finally value that should be stored in the property at the do you draw the line and move it to the codebehind if you are using inline are the pros and cons for doing it either one take more overhead than the i am not talking about assigning a value to a control that is just on the page but one that is being databound to because it exists in a repeater template or gridview item template obviously a literal sitting on a page you can just assign in i thought i would gather more especially with regards to the do most people not use the ondatabinding vs cons and

thoughts on what the variable length struct idiom allows you to perform one free store allocation per which is half as many as would be required if contained a if you are allocating a large number of then performing half as many free store may very well be if you are also doing network then the time spent waiting for the network will probably be more structure represents a are you planning to from a socket directly into a if you probably need to consider byte are you going to have to convert from host to network byte order when sending and vice versa when receiving if then you could the data in place in your variable length if you converted this to use a it would make sense to write methods for serializing deserializing the these methods would transfer it a contiguous taking byte order into you may need to take alignment and packing into can never subclass if you then the member variables would overlap with the of and you could use p and since is a pod type and does not currently benefit from having its default constructor and its destructor the benefit of doing so is that the global handles errors using the global if that matters to is possible to make the variable length struct idiom work with the new and delete but not you could create a custom that takes an array length by implementing operator unsigned int but you would still have to set the bitlength member if you did this with a you could use the slightly redundant expression p to allocate a the only benefit i see compared to using global and would be that clients of your code could just call instead of wrapping the in separate functions of calling is fine as long as they get called

times you are reporting are measured using the clock function returns an approximation of processor time used by the time real time will be less for multiprocessor but the processor time will typically be you use multiple the work may be done by more than one but the amount of work is the and in addition there may be some overhead such as contention for limited measures the total processor which will be the work any contention so it should never be less than the processor time for doing the work in a single a little hard to tell from the question whether you knew and were surprised that the value returned by was twice that for a single thread rather than being only a little or you were expecting it to be instead need the realtime library time still is less of a than one might hope but at least the numbers make some the bus frequency is 1600 so i suspect with a read and a write for each iteration some memory bandwidth limited as tstenner and the value shows that most of the time some of your processors are waiting for anyone know whether time includes such

to going ahead with cryptography is from experience after having seen vulnerabilities in encryption most of the vulnerabilities are due to the same reason the data transfer was protected by encryption with a secret but the key itself was exchanged in an insecure solves the problem of not just secure key but also of secure data protects your sensitive information by using assymmetric key cryptography to exchange the symmetric key used to encrypt information back and once the session has been the symmetric key is generated at and is a shared secret between the client and the it is this key that is used to encrypt all other traffic once the session is ready for transfer of public and private keys are used only to exchange this shared the only known way to compromise the shared key is to compromise the private key that the secret key can then be in it requires negligence or malice on the part of the server you roll your own encryption you must exchange the symmetric in a secure the easiest way to do so is to use the harder way is to implement your own assymmetric key exchange cryptography	
to have some have an xpath which i believe will retrieve the 5th element value attribute is suggests that the xpath will reference the yet non 6th i would like is an xpath expression which will reference the yet element regardless of how many items there are assume that this will pass an expression will count the number of current rather than a hard coded know how i would do but simply cannot find how i should do to i would like to return item node after the last item the attributes were there just to distinguish the existing i appreciate that this will return an empty well i have my answer so i guess only fair i explain why i wanted this the xpath is used by some code as a write address rather than a read pass the xpath of a non existent location to an ensurenodeexists i cannot alter this ensurenodeexists code will iterate each element of the creating it if not there and then setting it as the parent for the next i can call this code with 3 times and this will result in 3 item nodes being do i reference the yet xml node in a

to mark answer for how to style although i think that is what you are asking i will give you the technical details on how it works why it is fairly a look at the status bar when you hover over the profile link in the is where that tag is pointed now look at the address bar when you click the this basically proves that you left the page and the previous request was made with they are intercepting the click events on these and overriding the default functionality with something of their make this happen with all you have to do is assign a click event handler to those links like header headerlinks i l i var href the ajax page is a whole other the address bar to make it look like you were the link to make it look like you were the natural http return fabulous benefit to this approach is that it allows the back button to be functional a little added which has traditionally been a painful side effect of chronic ajax not sure of what this trickery but i bet somehow able to detect when the browser modifies the fragment identifier by checking it every a side changing the hash to a value that be found within the dom element will scroll the page all the way to the to see what talking you scroll down about 10 pixels from the top of exposing half of the top click on one of the it will jump it back up to the top of the page as soon as the fragment identifier gets updated window

try to answer my own it in the first easiest way out of this situation is to refactor the code to avoid the problem are two obvious ways to do instance does not create a but instead relies on external code to supply then will no longer the instance and is not responsible for disposing of externally created instance could be supplied via the constuctor or by setting the class somedisposableobject no creation public public somedisposableobject get return set the instance main issue with the posted code is that the ownership is at dispose time the class cannot tell who owns the it could be the instance that it created or it could be some other instance that was created externally and via the if it tracks this and knows for certain that it is dealing with the instance that it then it still cannot dispose of it as other classes may now have a reference to it that they obtained from the public the code can be refactored to avoid making the instance public by removing the property then the issue goes if it be for some reason the code cannot be refactored in these ways i stipulated in the then in my opinion you are left with some fairly difficult design dispose of the you choose this approach then you are effectively declaring that will take ownership of the instance when the property is makes sense in some particularly where is clearly a transient or subservient however it should be documented carefully as it requires the calling code to be aware of this transfer of may be more appropriate to use a rather than a as the method name can be used to give a further hint about class somedisposableobject new public somedisposableobject get return set if null public void if dispose if still the original this approach you would track whether the instance was changed from the one originally created by and only dispose of it when it was the here the ownership model is remains the owner of its own but if an external instance is supplied then it remains the responsibility of the external code to dispose of approach best reflects the actual situation but it can be difficult to implement the client code can still cause issues by performing operations like acontainer new originalinstance new a new instance was swapped a method then the original instance was unfortunately the will have called on the original instance when it was so it is now give up and let the gc handle is obviously less than if the class really does contain some scarce resource then not disposing of it promptly will definitely cause you it may also represent the most robust approach in terms of how the client code interacts with as it requires no special knowledge of how treats the ownership of the you know that the disposable resource actually scarce on your system then this may actually be the best commenters have suggested that it may be possible to use reference counting to track if any other classes still have a reference to the this would be very useful as it would allow us to dispose of it only when we know it is safe to do so and otherwise just let the gc handle i am not aware of any api for determining the reference count of an if there is one then please let me

trying to track down possible causes of my app not being able to connect to a db have a windows service that connects to the database when it the service runs on machines with a reliable wired network installed with startup automatic so normally it starts when windows and in almost all cases this works with one set of xp machines i have control the database connection fails when the service starts up with windows the standard exception is error has occurred while a connection to the connecting to sql server failure may be caused by the fact under the default settings sql does not allow remote sql network 26 error these machines if a user is logged in and starts the service manually it connects to the database which is pretty so i guess the problem at windows startup is service starts before the network is service starts before the machine can connect to dns to resolve the server name how db server names are is a on the machine that initially prevents outgoing problem occur when a user manually starts the so something must have happened to resolve the i guess this is either a process that runs at startup but finished when my service or the fact that a user has logged in possibly something in their logon have direct access to the so need to come up with a good idea of what the problem could be and a way to identify if i repeatedly deploy diagnostic programs so need to be thorough the first first question does anyone know of desktop network policies or software that could cause this second what can i do to diagnose exactly what is thinking of creating a new diagnostic service which will also be installed to start automatically and will perform various actions to see what is going and log this see if there is a network the database server by ip address see if it can find the the database server by the hklm registry key that contains the server name case the hklm registry is later sql connection to the database find out when this starts these steps every few have this service restart the then after a period have a user log the diagnostics should show some useful but anyone have a better idea or additional have also tried changing the service to run as a user account with suitable but that resolve the note that the local system account does have sufficient priveleges to connect to the db since the service works fine when manually so not the same as troublesome machines are running win gives a good discussion of error code connection work when service starts at boot but works when manually

two parts to your why are writes you say you have large you may want to clarify that with some the microsoft teams have demonstrated loads in less than an but of course using gear and specialized data warehousing been involved with data warehousing teams that regularly loaded so much data overnight that the transaction log drives had to be over a terabyte just to handle the quick but not a terabyte per find out why writes are want to compare your load methods to data warehousing for have you tried using staging table data and log files on different if not sure where to check out my perfmon tutorial to measure your system looking for how do you scale asked how to set up multiple database servers so that one handles the bulk load while others handle reads and some i would heavily caution against taking the approach because it gets a lot more complicated but using multiple servers for reads is not easiest way to do it is with log every x the primary server takes a transaction log backup and then that log backup is applied to the reporting some catches with this the data is a little and the restore process has to kick all connections out of the database to apply the this can be a perfectly acceptable solution for things like data where the end users want to keep running their own reports while the new data you can simply not do transaction log restores while the data warehouse is and the users can maintain connections the whole help find out what solution is right for consider adding the following to your size of your database in of millions of rows in the largest table having the size of your server storage box with 10 drives has different solutions available than a box hooked up to a method of loading data it are you using bulk are you using table	
two terms differentiate between two different ways of walking a is probably easiest just to exhibit the consider the b e first traversal would visit the nodes in this that you go all the way one leg before moving first traversal would visit the node in this we work all the way each level before going that there is some ambiguity in the traversal and cheated to maintain the order at each level of the in either case i could get to b before or after and likewise i could get to e before or after this may or may not depends on you kinds of traversal can be achieved with the the root node in are nodes in n get the node from store all the children of n in do some work on difference between the two traversal orders lies in the choice of use a recursive implementation uses the use a recursive implementation looks work on the payload foreach child of alternate time to work on the payload node recursion ends when you reach a node that has no so it is guaranteed to end acyclic this still cheated a with a little cleverness you can also the nodes in this is a variation of where i do the work at each node until walking back up the i have however the higher nodes on the way down to find their traversal is fairly natural in the recursive implementation the line above instead of the first and not hard if you use a explicit but leave it as an

type is a in other words a a struct cannot be so an example would struct mystruct is no way of ensuring that null is not passed as a parameter to a method the type of the parameter is a i have seen people create extension methods for doing a simpler less assertions on whether a parameter is this might be an option for on the other the check is short to begin and the intent of the check is very that might not be the case if you use a custom method of will add better options for doing this kind of programming by but is not available as pointed out in another answer is an option for doing what you postsharp works by adding a step where extra code is are some options for statically checking whether null might be for resharper lets you decorate your own method parameters with a and resharper will issue warnings at compile time if it can determine that the parameter might be of course this only warns you about bad coding it is not a runtime check and should not be used as	
typed languages must make all of their checks at runtime because the type might change during the course of the typed languages resolve all types during compile time so the cost is consumed up one is the main reason why dynamic typed languages are typically but there are other things to think a lot depends on the compiler or the gc the dispatch table layout and lookup algorithms along with other all depends on the a dynamic typed language can be faster than a compiled language it just takes more work to accomplish

updated following update of the question see still think right to be using the factory and correct in overloading the createlabel but i think in passing the labeltype to the createlabel missing the point of using the factory the entire purpose of the factory pattern is to encapsulate the logic which chooses which concrete subclass to instantiate and the calling code should not be telling the factory which type to the benefit is that the code which calls the factory is therefore shielded from changes to that logic in the and also from the addition of new concrete subclasses to the all your calling code need depend on is the and the interface type returned from logic in your code at the point where you call the factory must currently look something like this need to create a label need to create a small label need to create a large label need to create a custom label explicitly telling the factory what to this is because every time a new label type is added to the need the factory code to deal with the new labeltype and add a new to everywhere that the if you move the logic that chooses the labeltype value into your you avoid the logic is encapsulated in the factory along with everything if a new type of label is added to your you only need to change the all existing code calling the factory remains the no breaking is the piece of data that your current calling code uses to decide whether a big label or small label is that piece of data should be passed to the factory and label classes could look like class public labelsize size private public string trackingreference private public string size trackingreference added the null or empty class customlabel public string trackingreference private public string customtext private public string trackingreference throw new customtext class public ilabel labelsize return new public ilabel string return new hope this is

upgrade to svn on both client and the notes mention a speedup for large files this may not be too appropriate for you if you have to have the entire project in your working but use we do this for our large the first thing a client does is to checkout the top level directory then to get more use the repo browser to go to the desired directory and to this on it works wonderfully on also has the option to remove directories you no longer need to work this for you can still do an update on parts of the working update tends to be slow the more files you have windows that ntfs seems to be particularly poor with the locking strategy used for huijben noticed and suggested a fix tba with the but you could rebuild your current code with his alternative could be to change your if you can you could try the ifs but sure be cautious of option turn off your virus scanner for and also for the repository on the if running apache on the make sure you have keep alives on for a short time prevent from also turn off indexing on your working copy directories and shadow copy last help but you may see a better improvement that i turning av off on the server boosted my svn response 10x

using it is generally a bad idea to use an external without a revision it means that it becomes hard to correlate the version of the external with the version of the containing i know this the hard from trying to track down some history in a project that contained and i would have to guess which revision corresponded to the revision in the containing project it was earlier because someone had updated the external project and then updated the containing sometimes it was later because someone had edited files directly in the external checkout and then committed as suggested by the tip box a couple paragraphs into the section in the subversion you should always commit externals with a revision that whenever you check out a particular revision of the containing the appropriate revision of the external will also be checked it does mean a little more as you have to update the revision number in the property every time wrote a script to do it but in the long run it is a much better here is the skeleton of the script we used rake for conveniently updating the external and keeping everything in external for this project do rev rev or raise svn revision update the sh url sh propset update again to put the externals back to the right sh

using views in drupal the answer is yes with some important normal forms in exposed filter values come in as params raher than that means that you can populate an exposed filter just by appending to the current kicker is that if multiple views on the same page are looking for the same filter keys in the they will both use the incoming filter need to configure each list of exposed filters to make sure that they all user the same list of with the same list of for the incoming if you want the filter form to only appear you may have to do some crafty juggling as will want it to appear on each view by but an option on each view to move its exposed filters to a doing that and not enabling the exposed filter block effectively hides the exposed filter while keeping the filtering active if it comes in via the make sure all four views have the same list of exposed and are using the same for the hide the exposed filter widgets on all but one of the at that it should

very good advice problem is javascript work the same way most of the other popular languages if you dive into javascript with the idea that it is similar to then end up thinking javascript is a inconsistent mutant language that makes no effing sense this because javascript makes no because javascript is different at its javascript is an object oriented but it class prototype the syntax is similar enough to where you could work just fine thinking javascript was class based up until the point where everything goes horribly javascript at least the not that you even need a special ide or compiler since you can just use a browser or learning the fundamentals of javascript will definitely pay off if using

vouch for ruby but most of these languages follow the c idiom of file that means no way to do what you ask other than this usually takes one of two at the start of the file and scanning it remembering the most recent 25 when you hit end of print them similar approach but attempting to seek to a location that means seeking to end of file minus 4000 then doing exactly what you did in the first approach with the proviso if you get 25 you have to back up and try again to end of file minus 5000 second way is the one i prefer if you choose your first offset almost certainly only need one shot at log files still tend to have fixed maximum line lengths think coders still have a propensity for files long after their usefulness has i tend to choose number of lines desired multiplied by 132 as my from a cursory glance of ruby docs it looks like it follow the c you would use if you were to follow my then read forward from

want to do this between the channel or and your my preferred practice is to isolate file from structures by write code that builds the file buffers in a known and matching read code that reverses that specific example is particularly difficult to guess at because the bitfields are defined to be unsigned int and is particularly as a swag that then getting a pointer to the struct and reording the individual bytes probably gets you the answer you trick of defining the struct differently for different platforms but in the example you cite there a clean break at byte so it is not likely to be possible to produce an equivalent of one platform in the other without splitting one or more of the fields into two	
want to email and write to pdf very simple the reports are basically a list of divided in various the sections are not necessarily think just wasted a solid 2 days of work trying to make this kind of reports using i find that jasper is great for outputing the kind that would come out of a database for each row neatly describing an item and each item printed on a simplifying a bit but the given what i want to do i always ended up completely data not being displayed for no apparent columns of texts never the correct column positioning always ending up pagination not sanely possible was never able to figure it the faq gives an obscure came to the conclusion that jasper is really not built to make the kind of reports i am i missing ready to pay for a as long as the price is by reasonable i mean a few answer here is more information about the report i made in i want is something like i made in jasper is subreports are all the same actual this report has one field and basically just prints this field in a detail running a single subreport simply lists all items from the the datasource itself is a simple custom jrdatasource containing a collection of strings in the field the datasource iterates over the collection until there are no more each subreport has its own tried many different variations of the with all sorts of different properties for the this is fairly simple the problems i encounter are as starting from the 3rd show up when their position type is they do show up when they have relative to i want to do this because the first two subreports can be of any make each subreport to stretch according to its own they either stretch at all is not desirable because they have different or they stretch according to the longest this makes a weird layout for if some subreports fall outside the they simple one alternative is to increase the considerably and the band in this case it is not really possibly to know the total height in so stuck with it the report is even more long reports end up on one page and this is not acceptable printout text is too to have different reports with different pdf page i used ireport so possibly limitations of ireport listing here and not of jasper one of the things trying to find out asking this question one alternative would be to generate the jrxml myself with just static text but afraid encounter the very same i just generally wasted so much time getting anything done with jasper that i help thinking its not the right tool for the to say that jasper excel in what good is the best free or java reporting library for making

want to learn how others cope with the following is not homework or an assignment of any the example classes have been created to better illustrate my question however it does reflect a real life scenario which we would like feedback retrieve all data from the database and place it into an a object represents a single record and if multiple records exist in the we place the data into a of the record say we have the following public class public bool public string public string public public class public bool public string public string public string note that the getters and setters have been omitted from the classes for the sake of before any code police accuse me of not using please note that have been left out for this example database has a table for employees and another for employee what we do is to create a list object that represents the data in the database we do a deep clone of this object which we then bind to controls on the front we then have two objects and representing data from the user then makes changes to the object by deleting we then want to persist these changes to the we want to be as elegant as only deleting those records that require ultimately want to compare the two list objects so that we what properties have changed so that the changes can be persisted to the what properties no longer exist in the second so that these records can be deleted from the what new properties exist in the new so that we can create these in the wants to get the ball rolling on how we can best achieve keep in mind that we also need to drill down into the list to check for any not just the top level hope i have made myself clear and look forward to any object equality for database

wanted to have more than one controller and view for same in but it turned out to be a little complicated than i what i want to do is something like this will show product details to will show some extra information together with product and some commands like edit goal is to seperate the urls for the visitors and the first approach was that create a subfolder in the controller and the view so the things would look this way can map the urls to the correct controllers without a problem that i specify their since the class names are the when i return the view from the controller under admin it does not display the index view under the folder but the one under know i can say path to return the view i but obviously not a good solution and i want to do question what is the best way to take care of this with the condition of urls having to be that a custom controller class that overrides the view method any other ones that needs to be overriden for this and makes sure the correct view is one is an ugly but would a custom view engine that also takes folders into exactly know how i can do but as far as i this should also solve the of one actually uses a different layout for but in theory this should also but i am still not sure if this is the best way to do because having different controller view folders under the different parts of the site is not exactly what i leaning towards the custom view engine that takes the folders into consideration when returns the but like i i know how to do in controllers and

was i have used cmake and successfully compiled the resulting visual studio i found the cmake documentation very unhelpful i had to ask an existing user and the official manual costs was out of print at the the visual studio project it produced was very rigidly formatted according the template preferred by whoever wrote the i was unable to figure out how to customize project options or group source regularly on visual studio and for the most you just need to add all of the source files and header files into a visual studio project existing and add your entire source and then compile usually get so you start fixing bugs from if you used you may be stuck porting to an alternative or removing further word of visual studio and have different compiler for the most they both conform excellently to the but slightly code which works in one may not work in the i have found this to be particularly true when dealing with with visual studio being bizarrely permissive of syntax errors in many

was the last version to provide support for java so still widely used by shops that made the transition to or my stuck with deploying to an older weblogic best way to gain performance improvements is to use a mapping rather than having castor use reflection to your the mapping file can contain explicit xml element to java class and omit any translations you are not interested for if an xml record contains a billing information along with a history of the last 100 but all you care about is the billing you can explicitly map the appropriate xml elements to your billing information castor will ignore the remainder of the xml speeding up the marshalling final tip is to download the source code for castor even if you plan on building the code the documentation for been kept up to so some new features that appear to have been introduced in and higher have actually been added to castor as a quick comparison of the documentation and code will let you see what improvements have been recently made to castor

way always looked at it if the bash environment variables are all in i should export mine the say way to keep it the does not say that all environment variables should be in caps but the majority of environment built into bash are all in caps only exception i know of is	
way i handle it is to have an installed into program files next to the main on app i have the app download an xml file off of the web and save it in the app data this file contains the latest versions of the dlls and has a simple version through the list of filenames and if you have the dll locally or you have an older then add the needed dll to an update you generate your update fire off the with a command line list of the files to be you have to write them to program files but i on my updater pops up the uac prompt correctly it should to maintain program updater then downloads the files to program files and restarts the main problem with firing off the second app is that you have to give it a manifest with set in hard to but once the updater is done and retriggers the main it cannot start the main app with normal an exe running as administrator can only start other as administrator even if is set in the i know why you restrict it back to normal can only elevate permissions for some	
way i have found is to open the command prompt and browse through the folder you mention until you find the dll you want you can then user the copy command to get it windows explorer has a special view of this

way i would do it with subsonic is to make a view with the way you want the data to be and then retrieve it with

way is to enable webservice trace by wcf services do not report detailed information as service errors are technology specific to that service and should not transcend the service you would need to write additional code to disclose detailed exception enabling service tracing will allow you to log service calls and and see the stack without the additional and polluting your client with service exception quickest way to do this is to use the wcf service configuration editor tools in once you run the open config file that contains your service in the editor go to diagnostics menu and click clicking on the trace level options will bring up an dialog set the trace level to click on servicemodeltracelistener and check the callstack option maybe change the path of the log file for your you double click the file that is microsoft service trace viewer will fire up that will show you what the service is	
way is to start a select the contents of the row and compare it to what going to update it if they then do the update and end the if they rollback the	
way of dealing with this is you can wrap your values in a known unexpected or select select if was a possibility then use a different if there is no then you will have to use concise way of assigning values to a value allows the contional test code to remain	
way probably has pros and what i are nice because very common everybody should know how to use and manipulate the syntax can get ugly objects have great clean and also great at quickly implementing a i tried using them for something but quickly ran into some so if you need to do real with you might end up having to scrap list of objects is similar to a but lends itself to easier understanding of what trying to you have greater readability and easier but another object in your library only going to get used it might be too much typing for what a simple think used datatables like you did above one time because i know what i was if between that and a use a dictionary since more common and generic my but it really comes down to most important to you for the problem and if there are already and conventions in your current

we have this album one artist can have many and one album can have many this all 3 entities have basically the same foreign of the relationship to the corresponding children to album and album to typical solution to the provided solution would be three with the same fields albumid and foreign key constraints in the relationship can we in this incorporate a form of inheritance to avoid the repetition of the same field talking something of the this table would hold 3 entities this table will hold the name of the entity the name of an artist for the field of and entitytypeid holding 1 for 2 for album and so do you think about the above does it make sense to incorporate in this db would you prefer having the constraints of the first scenario or the more generic the risk of linking an artist with a track for since there is no check to see the inputter value is really of an come to think of i think you can actually check if an inputted value of the relfield of an artist corresponds to an with triggers favor abstraction or

well along in the development of our first wpf app for silverlight 3 looks but for this application i would still have chosen the application centers around presenting and manipulating very large sets of images hosted on a central server on our the software rate will be mass import of new images from a local no internet connectivity performance make this a project well suited for of our upcoming will require many remote users to access a single data store on our the data they work with requires significant validation and error so running that code locally is they will need the ability to work both on and offline and remain in synch with sql data sloob out of the will most likely be our choice for that one so they can have all the silverlight advantages but use it like a regularly installed even without an internet formats have their the trick will be to avoid using silverlight for everything we have more tools than just 1	
went through this recently while decoupling much the same thing from our ui can see my progress and my a does represent business data pulled directly from the business logic turns that data into a truly useful business first is to decouple the datatable from the business can do that by creating objects and that make up datatables and collections of and then you can make a listview that displays those i cover the latter steps in the links i posted and the former steps are as easy as the a class that will represent your through your datatable or however you retrieve the and shove those fields into properties of that object that that list to the gridview or listview to way your listview or gridview be tightly coupled to the method that you are retrieving your what happens if you decide to get your data from a json query or a xml file later then have to build this into 1 getting data from are multiple methods to get data from a no way i can go through all of them i assume that you already know how to retrieve data from a and if you there are a few to pretend connected to the and are using an to retrieve pick up the private void foos if else catch throw new column does not exist in that you can return a list by going through that process in a loop that targets the you do pretend that your being returned is a if you do and follow the first link i gave you can replace with and achieve the same result minor the class just contains the column names in the so you have one place to change them case you were update based on can always insert an intermediate in this insert a business layer between the datatable and the and discussed what do but a datatable is not a business it is a visual representation of a you transport that to the ui layer and call it they say you have to

what i understand about transactions in subversion this should be possible in but i know any tool that supports background is that we are discussing a migration from pvcs dimensions to and the main feature cited as missing in subversion is a design part is an arbitrary collection of files that can be handled all the source files needed for a idea to replace this is by copy operations in a which copy the relevant files into a but if all files are copied separately this may lead to a lot of which may clutter the so it would be nice to avoid more background project consists of several subprojects which are released but which share some common source files and external libraries imported from other reason cited for the design parts is restricting dependencies on source is for managing the products of so that all of them can be updated in version control in one both kinds of files are somewhat sprinkled across are about 5 developers on the can multiple copy operations be done in a single

when hired on to my current company a year i was tasked with migrating our development teams from they already had it in their minds that they wanted and since i had experience using and setting up i was a good i first tried to sell tfs because it woul dhave solved the problem i am in right but since money is and subversion is well you get i have finalized the propsal and the only thing standing in the way is the proposed that we store only our source code in and all release and other project artifracts be stored in our sharepoint so we have to give non developer stakeholders access to when i presented the all was excepted but the question arose about how to manage the syncronization between the artifacts how to is document x version associated with release my initial reaction is to create a section in the sharepoint porject page for each new release that will hold the artificats keep track of changes is there a better way of doing does anyone know of anyone doing or any integration packages to sync svn with is some info on the companies development all of our software is for internal we sell none of so our customers are all we have 2 types of those who take care of maintainance and customization of third party and those who write proprieatry software is where i our software we write is mostly but the 3rd party software is all over the board other crap that no ones cares about as i need to get this submitted i hate and i need management with subversion and sharepoint

work for a software development company and we have around 100 people working on a of these people are lately management wants to have a better way to rate individual programmers performance so the suggestion was to use bug reports as a the more bug reports on a developer the worse he this seems for more reasons than i can tell it is a subjective way of developers work on different projects of differing in addition if qa is measured for the number of bug reports they generate there will be a lot of discussions about the validity of bug would be a better way to measure developers performance in such a suggestion would be to not use bug reports from qa as a measure and instead use bug reports from like beta testers then when such public bug reports are issued also let qa be measured by after reading some of your excellent responses i was thinking that the general problem with the above described metric is that it is negative reporting bugs it encourage producing good quality i think the problem is that it is two there are the on one side who treat programmers as workers they want metrics then we have the who want to see themselves as artists or disturb me i am i think measuring quality can be done by metrics not without being instead things how a person reacts to willingness to creativity and above all quality of work are important and but mostly not necessarily

work on a web application product which allows mnemonics an underscore below the character to allow a keyboard combination and the key c to trigger the are created by different developers and they can each statically set mnemonics for can be so it is not necessarily known at design time the exact mnemonics which will be required for one can be at most one mnemonic using any character on a page containing many the the forms must be able to be localised into any meaning that the for close may not even appear in word used for ideal solution would be some algorithm where developers have to manually specify a instead they would be worked out at they would be and they would be both convenient and consistent did say the solution i was are there any good strategies for achieving something anywhere near the ideal to not talking about keyboard such as for which is hidden on a the mnemonics are only used for actions which are presented on the under button labels for not hidden keyboard shortcuts that would change on localisation are none we run in a web so the only accelerators are those which are part of whichever browser is being problem with attempting to choose the mnemonics at design time is that the people responsible for developing the ui are not aware of the as it could be done months the problem of using nested and modular forms means that even without the there could still be of the ideas batted around include having a global mnemonic registry which forms could use to apply for a certain mnemonic based on localised the registry would then calculate which was the best use of available somehow it would have to maintain the state of that such that the same form does not appear with different mnemonic sets over the course of the application it could possibly even be done statically and if i was looking to do something like that it would fit a more general algorithm i just have no idea which there any for dealing with localisable

works on eight byte the only way to encrypt data that falls short of eight bytes a multiple of is to pad it out this case with need to pass an eight byte buffer into your since you are encrypting in code you posted will actually encrypt four additional bytes of adjacent memory which is obviously not what you all eight output bytes are required in order to decrypt you just pass four of the encrypted bytes and expect them to be decrypted successfully at the other know this solve your problem i see any way to solve since you want to send only four bytes of encrypted data and blowfish always produces a minimum of	
works on potentially multiple so whenever your define these kinds of things or the current sdk root is prepended to the actual path getting passed to the one way to make this work would be to add your directory to the for assuming building with the mac os x you could add your opt library would now be found on your you want to do then you will have to look at cmake and find out how to get it to generate a library requirement for your actual library know anything about so i help you this is also why you see a difference between and re your other another you could also specify this path with the build would cause the linker to search as well as its standard paths and require you to generate a different project

world has check down and upvote think is still relevant even though there is a lot of hype surrounding bdd and other testing being if you are up for you could bypass learning and start with something like rspec and shoulda right but there is something to be said about following through the examples in the agile web development book to see where the ideas from bdd came find myself still using for some projects since it comes with rails and is still a very great testing long story i think obsolete but not the cutting edge any bdd is a testing paradigm shift especially if you start using cucumber and but fantastic once you get into shoulda is the easiest to make the transition so i would start with then move to then give rspec and cucumber a are testing or at least interested in the best in the end it matter what you use as long as you are happy with

would actually argue that the most important thing is to make sure that the terminology you use would be easily most duplicate bugs would come from using nonstandard for the exact i think it really matters that possible to create a horrible ticket in any long as the basic metadata that helps steer it to the right people is there what and everything else is just icing on the cake and the textual narrative is think most programmers are good enough at figuring out what could be report the browser version if i have a problem with a web but not bother to mention how many processors using or what my exact os version mention steps to reproduce if i can distill	
would add that ability to memory and performance trace is absolutely invaluable may also have a memory diff but i see a performance able to run a profiling session before and after a bug fix or then compare the results is incredibly especially with a mammoth legacy application in my where performance was never a priority and where finding bottlenecks could be very doing a diff allows you to see the in call count for each and the in duration for each is helpful not only during code but also if you have an application that uses a different for each if one customer complains of you can run a profiling session using their database and compare the results with a database to determine which operations are contributing to the of course there are many performance but sometimes i really helps to see the performance metrics from the application side closer to what the actually dottrace works and the diff is	
would agree with other i go with xml in your to suggest something try and the not a super powerful but free and gets the job if you see your database growing in size in the future more you should go with a more powerful database like sql or absolutely bound to xml for whatever i would agree with	
would also advocate a design where all the languages are stored in a single table with a language sql may be potentially vulnerable to sql if the variable cannot be trusted if the schema and table need to be validated to be a valid you can check it against using a technique like as from as join on is not declare as set exec you have the power and flexibility of dynamic but it is not vulnerable to	
would also log the useragent that made the request to it surprise me if it was a bot crawling your	
would ask your user to delete the app from the iphone itunes and then reinstall that will help ensure they getting the data may also want to make sure they jailbroken their in i try to ask for a wide variety of they have cellular and 3g on also ask about gps if your app uses itunes may be stashing crash logs on their hard drive macs under i know about windows ask your user to try to locate ones related to your app and send them to	
would avoid doing anything and instead use the queue and the database to synchronize as many worker processes as you care to start this application i think twisted or any framework for creating server applications is going to be it python script starts checks the does some checks the queue if you want a proper background daemon you might want to just make sure you detach from the terminal as described some maybe a block to email out failures to	
would be better to have functionality in your client you want to send serialize the data into a byte buffer and send it over tcp with byte receiving the data from buffer to your own interpretation can interpret byte buffer in any form as you it can contain basic data objects make sure to take care of endianess and also alignment	
would be helpful to see the but my guess is that you are not removing the child from the collection in addition to deleting	
would be inclined to split the view into multiples as ideally you want to avoid conditional logic in a view you find that would cause some duplication between your then likely that you could move that duplicated content into shared	
would be much easier to do in procedural looping through each character and marking them off in an or is this some	
would be my suggestion over the built in unit testing that visual studio	
would be needing to write a shell	
would be silly to preemptively fork the project when you know if you have submit your if they being responsively handled the whole design needs to be think about possibly	
would be the best way to reorganize the project and refactor the code so that it retains its current ability to access everything think actually quite close and probably better than many python projects where they just assume that there is only one instance of the and store values in a module global or is ok for many simple but really nicest to be able to bundle everything up into one application object that owns all inner classes and methods that need to know the first thing i would do from the looks of the code above would be to factor out any of those modules and classes that a core competency of your things that necessarily need access to the names like and sound suspiciously like much of their contents really specific to your they could perhaps be refactored out into separate standalone or submodules of your package that only have static stuff not relying on application i would put the main owner application class in the rather than a then from your or just the you can get a complete instance of the application as simply could also consider moving any basic deployment settings from the settings class into the you only have one possible set of settings and every time you instantiate you get the same little use in having all this ability to encapsulate your whole you might as well simply be using module doing with some of my apps is making the owned classes themselves into actual members of the owner application def def def possible to change or configure the application from outside it by the inner class def send called actually return not that worried about internal data this is python not we worry too much about evil programmers using properties and methods they we just put at the start of the name and let that be a suitable warning to those long chains slow the code down as really readability is the important anything else is premature	
would be the solution using simple file your directory has write permissions a replacement for your would while it	
would build classes that matched the data in the using attributes for length then use the object for reading the with some generic code for programming the parser based on the then reading the data and creating an instance of the class using use this for reading csvs and its generic and easy to i also have attributes that allow me to add generic validation to each field as its being share my but its the ip of the firm i work	
would check the if you wanted to do it in you can also use in

would create that column with a default value of but i would have the stored procedure set the actual think it is bad practice to have insert statements that do not include all i like to set a variable to at the start of the transaction and mark all createdate and lastchgdate columns with i never use dates in primary so if they are off a little or the it i feel it is better to see everything the user at the same	
would definitely always indent code when using braces for variable technique used for generated c code is to not worry about the formatting when generating the just throw the code out there without regard for line or after run it through to make the code readable for debugging this is much easier than trying to create all the formatting	
would definitely include the notion of a control if clarity is your this is a widely accepted interface that most people any case you can make the entire line so that it toggles when i click the text as well like an html label a button with just the text might confuse users whether it toggles the light or if the current state is	
would definitely not recreate the database each instead i would do the in the file and create some object based on each each row get the name and set that in the it were me i would also have an in memory cache of all the symbols and the current price data is never an int you can use company name is probably not unique as there are many options for a particular that should be an index and you can save space just using the id of a someone else also pointed out your web clients do not need to have to hit the actual database and do a query you can probably just hit your that really depends on what tables and data you expose to your clients and what data they query access for other users is also a reason not to keep removing and creating a

would go with the written in you will see a great productivity boost just by switching to scala is also very stable and extremely easy to call java code from your scala not only that but quite similar to java but with some added for some examples you should refer to things a java developer needs to know about twitter will move part of codebase to will never on a piece of code because you can just think about how you would do it in java and write similar first class functions and actors will give you an even greater productivity boost and are both in scala is of course statically typed and has a performance that is similar to will quote the author of the lift framework for an description of borrows from the best of highly granular sessions and security rails fast than just crud is templating style lift because lift applications written in an elegant new you can still use favorite java libraries and deploy your favorite servlet the code already written deploy to the container

would i want to use oracle designer as opposed to simply maintaining sql scripts and storing them in a version control system such as i need to decide if it is worth the effort to an existing database into it seems like it would be easier to store ddl scripts along with the application source code in the policy of my organization is to manage all database schemas using all for compliance if there is some sort of but i am not able to see how there would be any roi by an existing database into are the benefits of using oracle

would like to ask about your suggestions concerning unit testing against large want to write unit tests for an application which is mostly implemented in so mocking the database is not an database is quite large so restoring the database after a test run is also practically purpose is to manage the handling of applications for credit there are users in specific roles that change the state of objects and my job is to test part of this considering two agreements that meet specific conditions and then test changes of agreement state transition from waiting in some office to handled in this specific the agreements will be created in application itself and they will be my test all the tests will be in transactions that would be rolled back after performing these advantage of this approach is quite straightforward expected data could be easily described because i exactly know how the object should look like after the disadvantage is that the database cannot change in a way that will break the users and agreements used in test cases must always look the same and if there will be a need to change the database the preparation process will have to be agreements in unit programatically create agreements that would meet specific the data used for creating agreement will be chosen also the users that will change agreement state will be created advantage of this approach is ease of making changes to objects and ability to run tests on databases with different objects and have lots of fields and related data and afraid it would take some time to implement creation of these objects also afraid that these objects may contain some errors because the creation method will be quite hard to implement without do you think about these two any stack overflow readers think it is worth the effort create objects as described in second anyone here have any experience creating such testing against large

would like to say that i always write unit tests first but of course i numerous reasons well known to any real programmer what i also not do is to convert every bug which takes me more than five minutes to find into a unit even before i fix this has the following documents the bug and alerts me if it shows up again at a later point of helps in finding the since i have a place to put debugging code into up my data call the right set breakpoints on before i discovered unit testing i modified the function for this testing code resulting in strange results when i forgot to remove it afterwards it gives me good ideas what else could go so it quite often evolves in a whole bunch of unit tests and resulting in more than one bug getting discovered

would not dirty your control version system with such series of auto but i agree with the idea of using a control version system to provide that my suggestion use a repository for your software and another one for store the auto when the work is merge all auto commits in the main repository in only one logical i would do the main the location of your development the location of your work with dirty working remote add foo git fetch the checkout bar the begining of the tag the do git add git commit would not use a cron so you can the autocommits your your job deactivate the pending you have a lot of auto commits in branch and you have tagged the initial commit of the branch with your auto tag push foo user session push foo user session you have published your work and your lecturer may access update your foo rebase barbegin and proceed as described would squash all the there can be only push foo only one commit will be tag tag branch all i think no useful information may be gathered with such kind of i would try to avoid this but if really i would do that

would open fiddler and see what requests were actually being sent to the server and what the responses it may also depend on how you are actually requesting the and how you are serving the i demonstrate how to return password protected pdf documents in one of my wrox ebooks and in my handlers and modules presenation i do at user to download the code on the is the code i use to return a pdf using a it might help you run the supplied filename through a url decoder to change any back to their normal sdocument build a full physical path to the file on the sdocument we actually have the file to if false end next two sections are from scott but seem to be out of it was posted in is done to support older browsers that were not as managing document if 0 send the exit end dim language as string if 01 sep 1997 not exit end the opens the bypasses the if the file to the response output stream without is new to prior to that use end	
would point out that dynamic languages can have their types implicitly defined by the the same as a static nice thing about dynamic languages is that you can write method stubs that call objects and methods that do not actually this can be nice for designing the code first and filling in the details good when you are working in worry if you do this the compiler will usually give you a warning that the method call probably the compiler will let you code and run that code languages are although the power can make them harder to debug at	
would port them to um there are cobol compilers for current platforms out there unless we know a little more about why the code to be we may not be able to the platform on which it runs is management just pushing for a more are you having to move stiff from system z to windows its purest not that oocobol is mostly a simple procedural language so will translate to any of the other procedural languges fairly without although you avoid classes unless you have one big one language for perl et al can be made to

would prefer to do this without having to mock an httpcontext or anything like is there a way i can simulate the control being you are not asking to you are looking for an if you are not mocking the major in this the runtime the what you are testing is the integration between your control and you do not want to mock out the httpcontext and then i would suggest an automated web testing framework such as selenium or	
would probably just before you enter your make sure is got you get a then the screen clears after that good i would either switch to or write an executable instead of a know none of these are perfect but maybe one is good enough for you

would probably use but tk is definitely not the lack of releases is due to the bugs being ironed out over the a lot of people still use and it generally works event loop is somewhat but that is a detail that probably concern the only disadvantage is that your gui looks like it is from but who tool included with git showed that tk guis look fine as long as

would recommend against using the dataset editor for an xml there is a reason microsoft have stopped supporting the schema designer from vs have had no end of trouble with the schemas that were produced from the vs 2005 schema so much so that we have just recently had to would either use the basic xml text editor and the xml document outline or i would look at xml this is what we have just purchased using the free to validate and our

would say that you have to use the form tag at all in this input fields paolo bergantino said i would also avoid using the inline so instead input fields since this is still causing a i would perform some testing with the i believe that post calls would ever get but just in case try setting the cached to another to make sure your not having a serialization is to pass your data in already and if your still having issues you can try to set your datatype to

would start by collecting some performance metrics on the build on whatever system you currently use to i would specifically look at cpu and memory the amount of data read and written from and the amount of network traffic on windows you can use perfmon to get all of this on you can use tools like iostat and figure out where the bottlenecks are is your build cpu disk starved for the answers to these questions will guide your purchase decision if your build hammers the cpu but generates relatively little putting in a screaming raid disk is a waste of may want to try running your build with varying levels of parallelism as you collect these metrics as if using run your build with and this will help you see if the build is cpu or disk consider the possibility that the right build server for your needs might actually be a cluster of cheap systems rather than a single massive box there are lots of distributed build systems out there that can help you leverage an array of cheap computers better than you could a single big	
would stay away from anything that would run too long when working in a that includes some query just to determine a static table layout you want to write the code so you can build a do this type of thing all the but mostly with stored procedure i have most of this in a template i this will display the column nicely within quotes or show function to return this into your into columnnameint columnnamevarchar columnnamechar from sure you have one row for each column in your table you have more just delete the extra ones if you want to see any dates in use the convert as shown this from syscolumns sc inner join sysobjects so on where order by the output in sql server management studio text output and do a square over the column and copy this column based back to your code and a square over the complete values in the left column of the insert statement and if you made a column it will replace the column only and leave the code unchanged to the left and do the same thing for the values in the right of the insert and you now have an insert that will build the data you want but will not waste too much time in the	
would store the month as an integer then you can easily sort	
would strongly recommend setting up one procedure for a page and managing all sql actions if there are multiple tasks to perform on the page that require multiple just have one procedure manage the other your proceedure can always return multiple recordsets if page will perform faster of data going back and one all code on the sql is already compiled with executions will be able your errors much in one place as in two places having systems to decide if enough to fail passing back and forth to data minimize your points of the transaction is going web server the is left waiting for will save tons of time troubleshooting and will help modularize your code on the sql you can reuse sprocs to perform like tasks and end up with a more fleixble scalable robust	
would suggest comparing the version of on the working and vista machines and comparing their checksums even if they report the same things to it possible that the machine has a version of it possible that a version of has been copied onto the machine and is being picked up by the depends utility that comes with visual studio may help it possible that a virus or worm what has replaced the might also be worth reading this on activation	
would suggest not going this at build time but at you probably have enough processor speed to deal with the generating of the i would aim to save on would definitely set your web server to send out the pages as compressed files the application you can build in filters that will take your finalized rendered html pages and do the processes you speak removing could build an isapi which is the older harder you could create stream filter and just override the write set the to be your stream a quick

would suggest using or as the parameter collections should be preferred to reference if you happen to have an array does the conversion allows gets and sets back through to the but obviously not modifications which would change the array may have to use wildcards in static void extends for something something is processed is noteworthy that and work slightly keeps the original array to back the so changes to the collection will be reflected in the makes a copy of the collection making a copy is often what you would want anyway if you are returning an if you are passing as an argument you generally do not copy storing as a

would use levels of linked node would have a pointer to forward sibling backward sibling first child parent each messages would be sorted in the list by vote count whatever other score you wanted to would give you maximum flexibility for moving things around and you could move whole just by changing the links at the parent and that say gets a influx of votes that makes it more popular than the changes are both the next and previous sibling it continues until it garners more votes than the following the pointer of is set to was still relatively to only needs to occur when a score change results in a message becoming more than its upper sibling or less than its lower you need to after every score

wpf it was possible to organise the xaml for multiple user controls by keeping the markup in separate xaml files in the themes folder and then using mergeddictionaries to import them into the availability of the silverlight 3 beta introducing merged dictionary it seemed like it might be possible to do the same with silverlight user but despite trying all combinations of build action on the merged dictionary files and the corresponding syntax for the source reference in i seem to get it anyone else does anyone know if it is possible and if so what i am doing so after numerous test getting working samples in wpf and moving the xaml and code over to silverlight 3 and it still i did a full uninstall and reinstall of all the silverlight 2 bits and all the silverlight 3 beta bits and finally got things can only assume that i somehow ended up with a faulty install of the beta i know but it seemed like i was still running in the silverlight 2 runtime despite apparently having the version 3 runtime jared for taking a look at things and checking with the sl3 thanks to and for producing the instructions and batch files for running silverlight 2 3 on the same mergeddictionaries in in silverlight

written a helper class that takes a string in the constructor and provides a lot of get properties to return various aspects of the currently the only way to set the line is through the constructor and once it is set it cannot be since this class only has one internal variable i was wondering if i should keep it this way or should i allow the string to be set as example code my help why stream new line responses line new if is a quick example of counting the number of valid responses in a given scanned would it be more advantageous to code it like this stream new line new responses if code is used in the back end of a web application and needs to be somewhat i am aware that this may be a case of premature optimization but coding this for responsiveness on the client side and i decided to include the constructor of the class as well this is what it really class private string public the date the exam was public datetime datetime test out return a value indicating whether to use raw public bool useraw get return true the raw points per public float float test out return 2 i included some sample properties of the class to help as you can the class takes a fixed string from a scanner and simply makes it easier to break apart the line into more useful the file is a line delimiated file from a scantron machine and the only way to parse it is a bunch of calls and new instance or just set internal

xml error is because an xml document must have a single root suspect that the php is supposed to generate some xml and then enclose it in something that gives it a single root and that the wrapping process is a total i think we need more information about what the php code is doing to be more you can open the problematic resource in firefox instead of you should be able to view which will show you the content of the that might help you diagnose the if you use maybe you can code up a small http client to retrieve the resource and print out the

yes and no as per comments are fundamental differences and xml is a particularly suitable for textual documents various kinds of office good enough for many other problems mostly arise for it having hierarchic model relational as in or as in oo is an meaning it has bit more natural fit for handling use cases where xml sort of but where there is more cost in overcoming impedance between object and hierarchic is not a perfect fit still not objects do full but it is more natural than as it is easier to build tools to do good decent and simple data plenty room for and i would expect both to be used for long time to always in optimal but both can do plenty of use cases well what it is since writing my original i have seen json absolutely annihilate xml for use cases for companies i have worked soap will start significantly and old data interchange with restish for java for will take yet xml is much better for textual	
yes this can be and its fine with the and work on and problem is you have the syntax wrong second cook up a here it this sample is valid and used it quite but indeed most programmers know how to get it void use a but a char array is statically safe and determined at return

you actual solutions themselves and the projects they hold build you mean that they build correctly within the or that you can go to those solution directories on the command line and run or things i would try are first narrow down the offending by telling tfs not to build in turn off support do a binary search by trimming away once you get to the offending build with the parameter to get even more details about the state of the msbuild you can write a small app that invokes the msbuild engine directly and debug that application by catching first chance exceptions and having reflector code in engine	
you actually need to sort you are exactly correct that it will have no effect if the members are grouped together or not least with a good random number generator intuition is dead on here it will have no effect to and as you you have to waste a bunch of time and effort sorting

you actually want to look at the raw memory for some reason you can open the debug window from and write the address you want to look at in the edit you can also write in the edit box any expression which evaluates to an address and show you that for instance is not very useful for actually looking at variables because have a tough time parsing the raw bytes into meaningful values but it can be useful for debugging situations where you suspect there are buffer overruns or memory that is overwritten it is particularly useful when used in conjunction with

you are comparing operator overloading between java and you be talking about and java expose enough memory management detail for and need overload the other operators for pointer types at least one argument must be a class or enumerated so he be talking about providing different operators for operators in operate on values or const references to would be very unusual for operators which operator on values or const references to values to return anything other than a from obvious errors common to all functions returning a reference to a stack allocated object is the opposite of a memory or returning a reference to an object created with rather than a value is usually done no more than once in a career before being it would be hard to come up with a scenario where the common operators have memory there any need to create multiple versions depending on whether the operands are stack or heap allocated based on normal patterns of arguments to an operator are objects passed as either values or there is no portable mechanism in to test whether an object was allocated heap or if the object was passed by it will always be on the so if there was a requirement to change the behaviour of the operators for the two it would not be possible to do so portably in on many test whether the pointer to the object is in the space normally used for stack or the space normally used for but that is neither portable nor entirely even if you could have operators which took two pointers as no reason to believe that the objects are heap allocated just because they are that information simply exist in only duplication you get is for cases such as where the same operator is used as both an accessor and a then it is normal to have a const and a so you can set the value if the receiver is not that is a good thing not being able to mutate publicly accessible state objects which have been marked

you are in an ascx and need to access a control in the parent aspx you could do this as mycontrol it is worth investigating exactly why you need to do this in general it is not a good practice for the child user control to perform actions inside the parent an alternative approach would be to have the ascx throw an event in a given which the parent page would in turn subscribe to potentially perform an internal action based on the this would allow interoperability between the page and user control while still encapsulating each functionality

you are trying to write documentation that support people will use to help programmers even be a part of the very possible that the developers will come up with great and relevant documentation but i think very good technical writer or just a good writer in general that knows the software well would be a better choice to write what sounds more like a user

you call you are notifying the session held by the repository to track that object and synchronize the changes to the database at the next until you flush the no changes are made to the the object does become part of the session cache and so will be returned by the you run a query to populate a the session queries the database to get the unless it has already cached those you have not updated the database the car you added to the session will not be part of the result possibly if reading the documentation both query results and entities should be added to the session that necessarily mean that the queries the cache after adding the db having a hard time wrapping my head around exactly going an i believe you can set the session to autoflush but have to check the think i might see going on the default session is but creates a session with a set to which means the session will not unless you explicitly call or commit the with a of nhibernate will flush the session before querying to prevent stale data from being if your db transaction looks something from into car values it auto flushes seems a bit ambiguous from the i have the most common answer is that it with it flushes although guarantees that will never return stale since nhibernate linq actually just creates a criteria it might not trigger the auto flush this has been fixed hard to it seems to me that in your case you want to flush after your save because you immediately want to retrieve the results of your in a smaller unit of work where you were only updating a single would be maybe would do the trick but the fact that the uow factory explicitly sets the mode to commit seems to be encouraging you to really think about your uow

you can give us a little more detail about how the serialization is do you use a custom serialization or do you just use the attribute think that a good way for you to handle this is to try to do your custom serialization logic and only serialize only what you it go to anyway it also depends on how much memeory your application has

you can listen on a socket for multiple incoming connection when the connection is it connects a unique port on the server to a unique port on the in order to multiplex a you need to control both ends of the pipe and have a protocol that allows you to switch contexts from one virtual connection to another or use a stateless protocol that care about the in the former case need to implement it in the application layer so that you could reuse existing in the latter case you could get by using a proxy that keeps track of which server response goes to which since connecting to yahoo i think be able to do this since it requires an authenticated connection and it assumes that each connection corresponds to a single

you can never something from an compiler can forget what you know in detail about the particular instance you what subclass it the debugger knows much more than the so it will tell you what actual type the current instance which is probably what sounds like writing logic that needs to know what type of object using which is not recommended in oop but often required for practical i said in a comment to the you should be clear on what is the base class intuitively restricteduser should be a subclass of user since the name suggests a more specialized having an additional active adjective on in your case this is special since this is a limiting adjective which would let you put user as a subclass of restricteduser totally i would recommend renaming the two to something and nonrestricteduser to avoid the limiting adjective which is the confusing part	
you can not access other maybe you can log session variables and read with your tracking	
you can peek at a queue to see if a message is in it before simply query the queue using select instead of receive and you can look at the better bet would be to send the messages and have the stored procedure which receives the messages decide if the message should be tossed out or send hundreds of thousands of messages to service broker at a time without any sort of performance you are seeing performance issues then try sending more than one message per conversation as that is the quickest and easiest way to improve service broker

you contain characters inside a string in php just about any other you need to escape those literal else use which are typically interchangeable in specification of quote types to delimit attributes sgml requires that attribute values be delimited either double quotation marks decimal or single quotation decimal single quote can be included within the value when the value is delimited double quote and vice last sentence applies to html attribute strings that contain which is not your but you do have php code with a quoted string containing and php supports the same policy about

you could generate the by one of the advantages of a is that it guessable given record there is usually little point an checking for record re as long as you have a index on this not sure that this is an you normally put a clustered index on a so the table will be a heap you have a separate clustered such as an in which case you will be adding to the and inserting the new into the no real problem of using the time directly is that you introduce a lot more risk of you would need to worry about creation avoiding repetition when creating a few in which means etc and it gets even more troublesome if multiple machines are working intensively in parallel chances are get

you create a new projection through a it be expected that your indexes will still apply on the columns that are indexed on the original table and included in the when you filter on the projection not in the udf against the original table with the the indexes no longer you want to do is parameterize the function to take in the you find that you have too many fields that you want to set parameters then you might want to take a look at indexed as you can create your projection and index it as well and then run queries against

you declare a type or method with extra tags to indicate the generic public value public t value above defines a generic type where the is provided by the by generic type arguments start with if there is only is fine otherwise name them all generics are provided by the runtime compiler for foo new have been replaced with in the if you can restrict generic arguments with where t struct will refuse to compile as is not a struct valid constraints class struct except has a public parameterless someclass is someclass or inherited from isomeinterface implements can also involve other generic type for or another type can have as many generic arguments as you struct things to members etc are defined generic type so a static field on is separate to that on can be generic too try to avoid using the same names as the class as you be able to types inherit the generic types from their class is effectively for the outer	
you declare a variable compiler knows only about the methods in and will thus produce a warning if you try to call any of the such as on that cocoa defines an protocol that mirrors the class and instance by declaring that implements the you give the compiler a hint that all of the methods will be implemented by an instance that implements is all this allows objects to descend from any root in nsobject is the most but not the only root is also a root for therefore an instance of type does not inherit	
you declare those the compiler reserves space for 10 you assign one is just a pointer to the first just copy the not the there are functions like if you want to assign x to have to assign it to a

you do not override anything that compares your objects may get it it is documented that must return the same value if two instances are then it is the prerogative of any code which wishes to test them for equality to use as a first pass to group objects which may be equal it knows that objects with different hash codes cannot be if your method returns different values for equal objects then they may get into different groups in the first pass and never be compared using their could affect any data but would be particularly problematic in based ones such as dictionaries and always override when you override and ensure their implementations are

you each different actual template makes an entirely new which has relation inheritance relation with any any other with a diffent actual made from that except that each provides the same so that a you can handle then the neither the static types or the dynamic types have any me drop back and i declare a pointer to has what we call a static of if class bar is a subclass of and i point fp at new new we say that the object pointed to by fp has the dynamic type of bar2 also publicly derives from i can do new without ever even knowing what fp points i can call virtual methods declared in and have the compiler make sure that the method defined in he dynamic type pointed to is a typename t struct baz void and are two different class with no only is that i can call on but since the static types have no if i have a i point it to a not even with a the compiler has no way to a call to the baz dosotheing method into a call to a because is no there is no there are ony and and but no common baz is not a baz is a a set of instructions about how to make a class if and only if we have a t parameter bound to an actual type to a there is one way i can treat those in a they present the same and the if it knows what kind of baz really dealing can make a call to that method a static access of a member a template is not a template is the instructions of how to synthesize a a in a template is not a an instruction of how to write the code to make a that was long winded and outside of a template there is no relationship between a paramvector and so your assignment with partial application of you can write a which gives a of how to transform a to a notice the t and the if you can write code to turn any kind of regardless of actual template parameter into any other kind of you can package that up as a partially applied and the compiler will add that function for probably involves making a and transforming each t in the into a u to put in the which still let you asign to a maybe you want to have both templates and in that you can same that all paramvectors regardless of type inherit from some and then there would be a relationship between all be sibling subclasses of that base

you followed all the instructions on it seems to cover more registry settings than what you as you point looks like that page is for annoying how msft culls legacy information and makes it downright hard to thing to check is the event logs maybe they contain a it may be possible to crank up the auditing level to see more have your code so i debug it but i was able to hook a debugger into and get control at the point it launches the utilities on the secure maybe if you do this you can figure out the security the target the debugging tools for rdp the to bring up the utility manager and leave it sure your symbols and source are visible on the target at the same path that they were compiled on the dev another into the target computer as a user with the rdp windbg and attach to the utilman process it break into the press to ensure your utility gets loaded into this debugger instance when it to continue on the target computer console your utility from the utility the debugger the rdp should break inside the new process and you should be able to debug from have visual studio on the machine where i tried this if you have vstudio on the target machine you can probably use it instead of your utility even then windows is doing some kind of validation prior to the call to the security logs might be able to help you i tried using the utility to locate the program that generates the dialog but on an english winxp so i have the actual i also looked for hardcoded with no you can figure out what exe is putting up that dialog perhaps you should be able to attach to it with the debugger and walk back up the stack to find the check that errors once you have the general vicinity of the check that you should be able to set a breakpoint earlier in the codepath that should break into the debugger the next time you try to you should be able to step through the failing check from for all of make sure you have the since it should make the much easier to not familiar with whether your debugger has support for the symbol

you go for mutability then you will find that whenever you need to call a method that you want to have the object or you need to return an object that is part of the internal you need to make a defensive you really look at programs that make use of mutible objects you will find that they are prone to by passed to passed to returned from issue show up very often because most programs change the data are in reality immutable by virtue of them never personally make every thing i possibly can i probably have of all variables marked as there are some cases where it has to be but the vast majority of cases it does think it might depend on your if you are writing libraries for 3rd parties to use you think about this much more than if you are writing an application that only you your will find that you can write large scale applications using immutable objects for the majority of the system without too much

you have an answer that is not java sqlite be pleased to read store items in a database with the following scheme item this is the primary if it the id of the item containing this date an ordinary foreign key to a pair of named geocontext this is the primary name way for the user to label a pair of coordinates x one of the y the other must filter the items according to the geocontext and the it would be a easy job if items were all at the same but the trick is 2 is no explicit limit to the recursive if we are in any node and filter with the date of we must see not only the items directly contained in the node that match the but must see the items that contain items matching the date as we are in if matches the then we consider matches the date too and we must keep if we are at the then item 2 must be goes for the but even harder because stored in an other the context is a costly mathematical brute forcing the matching would result in the software to be slow and a very poor user need to display a i display a list of filtered data from a we must see only a flat list of the top the challenge is to decide whether to display each element or according to all the children i tried to solve thought i could ease a bit the problem by using more tables to cache flat data i can join the items table on this i can delete update a and so delete update the i can delete update a and so delete update the x i can brute force y date seems but i tried it it should the following drawbacks moved the costly process to the set create delete methods have to manage the cached will be a troublesome code and a five item will triger a process hit recursively five size ot the data base a five de depth store cached data for know if this a a app with i think insert more thatn 1000 more than 10 level of the good news is we go from bottom of the pyramid to the the other so not horrible as it when i have to deal with parent it will be another but i save it for question my would you store the data and process the filtering int the most optimal way i define an explicit recursive depth limit i perform the filtering using sql or java sql surely will be but matching the geocontext is far easier to do in i am working on the android i have the following constraints is the only language not with the entire standard is the only dbms and memory are in case you have to life and is the external libs may not be be i dug into so and found some interesting pieces of information a but not a problem data processing performance using java and

you know how to setting you know how to setup mysql in netbean	
you know how to structure your code in java or then you can follow the same principles with c the only difference is that you have the compiler at your side and you need to do everything extra carefully there are no packages and you need to start by carefully designing your the most common approach is to create a separate source folder for each you need to rely on naming conventions for differentiating code between different for example prefix all functions with the name of the have classes with but you can easily implement data you create a and file for every abstract data if you prefer you can have two header one public and one the idea is that all constants and functions that need to be exported go to the public header tools are also very a useful tool for c is which can help you find bad smells in your another tool you can use is which can help you generate

you look at the assembly in the handy you will see that there is indeed a reference from to if you use one of the plugins for reflector that will export the reverse engineered code to files and then search through there is no actual use of since the runtime will only load assemblies when they are actually the winforms assembly should never actually be loaded through any usage of	
you look at your those two blocks are very i bet they can be refactored into a single that sound like an it i think in general if you feel the desire to use braces like you are dealing with a situation that would be better handled by factoring out another method or refactoring pieces general once i got good at oo and limiting how much work i do in a single never thought they might be a good with code that it must be fairly easily try a sorry if i get the syntax i really do and java have i know output is it is in the example as var var you never said where source came var items p getcontent may need to be passed you say where those calls came see comments return like this save much but they show up some great as the relationship between foosource and transforma possibly the getcontent is a decent chance that they should be stored in a single object and that object should be passed or something hard to tell from this often refactoring requires a much wider view of the code than you that they also force you to think about getfoocontent and bet you a pint of beer that these are so similar that they could either be factored into a single method call with a variable or two passed in or into a method in two sibling of the way this kind of relationship always shows up and always improves other code in your i believe these kind of refactors are absolutely doing this kind of refactoring more than anything taught me real

you mean looks like it might be javascript you can check all your javascript source code for common mistakes without actually running the script or opening the web lint holds an advantage over competing lints because it is based on the javascript engine for the firefox this provides a robust framework that can not only check javascript syntax but also examine the coding techniques used in the script and warn against questionable is the same sort of takes a javascript source and scans if it finds a it returns a message describing the problem and an approximate location within the the problem is not necessarily a syntax although it often jslint looks at some style conventions as well as structural it does not prove that your program is it just provides another set of eyes to help spot a perl module and it been updated since validator for	
you mean rtsp in france we have a provider that is providing tv channels in so that you can view it on a computer using think the compression is and the stream is around 4 channels are also available in but i did not try careful that people might have a good but it can become quite loosy if they use can google for rtsp multiposte freebox and see if you can find some more think the protocol matters that i guess with h264 you can target lower rate than with an mp4 encoder doing live encoding frame what i consider medium quality was achieved at 1 mbps on a video what do you mean by hd exactly question is not very clear because there is two aspects are the encoding sources and what are the decoding will give you a scale of bitrate vs visuals then you have the problem of target audience and bandwidth and the quality of is your bottleneck

you mention i will assume you are new to ddd ddd compliments the in mvc by placing logic where it i think a good amount could be applied strict ddd i would use your movie example as an aggregate root ddd within you would have business logic that obtain the categories and related entities directly related to movie this assumes the list you want to display is a list of categories this movie is class private public you can use return public void you can treat categories as a value object a ddd here if you have an identity on what gets more interesting is if you do want to keep an identity on your treating them as aggregate roots with multiple entities and relations to other vos and in this you would want to utilize the ddd concept of services to combine the two aggregates into your requested model you want to pass to your this allows you to create business rules around loading the class class class moviecategory private public return internal class public moviecategory moviecategory mc do some logic some to obtain your categories maybe cats return concept is that you now have logic in the domain in this to handle the complex creation of these or using factories to create complex types as gives you a model you can pass around to different view and final step in your original post is how to get this into the been playing with the viewmodel approach to this creating viewmodels either or as a and hanging all of the entities on this a recent stackoverflow question hits on this passed the model directly into and i am now trying this it does clean things as your domain model really should be disconnected from the on your i find myself i need to get this partialview populated based on this guess that means another method on the going the viewmodel approach removes the from the domain and puts it where it belong in the layer of where you are your	
you mention that you have the freedom to modify the class the base myclass ctor to take in 3 parameters foo and comment out the globalvar references and simply cache passed in this should throw up a bunch of compile errors no ctor which takes 1 each one to pass in and get it to now minimize hits to the db by lazy load and caching the foo and bar expose via some property on	
you might find that making use of lazy loading than eager might help increase the performance avoid using since the entities need memory allocated for the relationship chains deep loading of the object and instead they will be populated on need to be focused in your design to support this you will simply move the performance bottleneck to become overly with regard to sql statements being executed against the sql ce datacontext can also start to bloat as it tracks you might need to consider your approach to how you use data contexts you can attach them to new contexts provided the original context has been	
you missing a on the s side after sending the

you misunderstood the difference between and and purpose of the short cut operators and is that the value of the first operand can determine the result and so the second operand need to be is especially useful if the second operand would results in an null null with you always have to evaluate the second operand to get the result so the only meaningful operation is

you need the features of the series of if you need if your service cannot be completely described as as defined by the http if you like having to author xml for every interaction with the and parse it then you need use been some question about the value of a my imagination fails me when it comes to imagining how anyone could fail to understand on i have to think that anyone who has ever used a service much more complicated than would know why it is valuable to have someone else write the code that accepts creates the xml to send to the sends receives the then turns that back into i suppose this might not be necessary when using a restful at least not with a restful service that does not process complex even with a relatively simple service like used as an example of calling a restful one benefits from understanding the structure of the returned even the above service provides an xml schema it unfortunately describe the entire given that schema one still has to manually process the or else use a tool to produce serializable classes from the of this happens for you when the service is described in a and you use a tool like service in visual or the or you want start with the and go on to any other services with more complicated another thing that requires is description of the messaging patterns and protocols supported by the perhaps not required when the only choices are http verbs over http or life gets more complicated if using and	
you need the functionality of virtual you have to pay the the advantage of is that you can use a very efficient implementation of virtual dispatch provided by the rather than a possibly inefficient version you implement lumbering yourself with the overhead if you needx it is possibly going a bit too and most classesare not designed to be inherited from to create a good base class requires more than making its functions

you need to compare using one of the build in equivalence you can use or depending on whether you want to look for equality using or b b b b you can these functions return the sublist starting at the first matching element if they find an this is because if you are searching a list that may contain you need to be able to distinguish the case of finding a from the case of not finding the element you are looking a list is a true value only false value in scheme is so you can use the result of or in any context expecting a such as an or b is the difference between the three different based on which equivalence function they use for thus tests if two objects are the same underlying it is basically equivalent to a pointer comparison direct value comparison in the case of two strings or lists that look the same may not be because they are stored in different locations in thus performs a deep comparison on lists and and so basically any two items that print the same will be is like for almost anything but for two numbers that are numerically equivalent will always be but they may not be is because of bignums and rational which may be stored in ways such that they be that some behavior of the functions is undefined by the and thus may differ from implementation to i have included examples that should work in any compatible scheme that implements exact rational you need to search for an item in a list using an equivalence predicate different than one of the built in then you may want or from x 2 3 4 5 5

you run an entire website off of a single and that machine is more than enough to handle your then images are not a bottleneck that needs solving right forget about s3 for as your server gets you will want your server to be spending all of its time doing server transferring static content like flat html files and images is an dumb and wasting precious active and cpu cycles on them is no by switching to your server can concentrate on doing which is whatever your program actually also has benefits of being distributed around and attached to probably a fatter pipe than your which means the images will show up slightly more quickly on your so an added is also backed which means that it makes for a pretty nice place to store pretty much any private data under the in addition to stuff that you want to serve to others confuse the permissions settings between those two things in you may want to use separate accounts is also which means that if you want to let users upload files to your site s3 is a great choice so that you have to constantly worry if your server is going to run out of disk space warning like i said at the if a setup with a handful of none of this really a tool like any and it may not be something you need

you say probably cut wondering which xslt approach you have in approach would be to somehow transform the instance data for the not sure how that would work in and maybe why you said xslt approach would be to use xslt to produce a schema tailored for the current state of the form then use this schema to build the for the transformed schema would exclude definitions for fields that ready for display this sounds quite feasible to me that volunteering to the i know well enough to say if its caching would be suitable for your have thought that you want for reasons that get try to clarify what i what i was hearing in your description is that the current state of the record may affect the structure of the for the legal values for field a may be constrained by the values of fields and some of which may actually be unknown and unknowable at a given this ambiguity might make it difficult to present the form using a unified thought was that perhaps you have to limit yourself to an immutable if the current state of the data would be better represented by a modified schema one that reflects the allowed enumeration values for field or the union choice that is currently allowed for field then i proposed that perhaps transforming the schema before creating the form might do the to your comment about be concerned that caching might result in stale form definitions being served up when newer ones are due to changes to the data and the perhaps you could avoid this by permuting the namespace url based on the current state of the customized hope this	
you saying that they want to do text if the they will ruin the ability to do meaningful reporting on the because i can guarantee that they will not consistently enter the they are going to be entering one of several preset strings grades of then make a lookup table for those strings which maps to numeric values for they really want to be able to start entering in text and you dissuade them from add another column along the lines of have a predefined value that means to put in your value that when doing reporting you can either roll up all of those random values or you can simply ignore make sure that you add the into your systemcodes table so that you can keep a foreign key between that and the results if you already have then you should definitely consider adding

you sure you want to use that will be a which will be if already decided on a 9x9 convolution you need any the cheapest way to do convolution in c is to set up a loop that moves a pointer over the summing the convolved values at each point and writing the data to a new this loop can then be parallelised using your favourite method mpi the you assume the values to be 0 outside the then add a 4 element border of 0 to your 2d array of this will avoid the need for statements to handle the which are your data wraps at the boundaries it is then use a modulo or add a 4 element border which copies the opposite side of the grid fgabcdefgab for 2 this is what you are implicitly assuming with any kind of fourier including if that is not the you would need to account for it before any fft is 4 points are because the maximum boundary overlap of a 9x9 kernel is 4 points outside the main n points of border needed for a x you need this convolution to be really your grid is consider partitioning it into smaller pieces that can be held in the and thus calculated far more this also goes for any you might want to do are ideal for this type of

you were using oracle then advise benchmarking three table with primary key table hash represents a very vanilla approach really the lowest common but could mean logical reads to get each with one of those being a probable physical read of the table if it is not completely will save you one of those logical read by avoiding the probe to a separate table but might not save you the physical read because the iot segment will be larger and harder to cache than the index will potentially get you the row with a single logical but unless you have the entire table cached probably going to translate into a physical is highly	
you will want to know the ip address of someone visiting your while has several ways to do this one of the best ways seen is by using the of the servervariables your visitors are behind either a proxy server or a router and the standard only captures the ip address of the proxy server or when this is the case the ip address is then stored in the server variable what we want to do is first check and if that is empty we then simply return this method is not it can lead to better below is the code in taken from blog post returns multiple ip string context string ipaddress if addresses if return return shared function as dim context as dim sipaddress as string if return dim iparray as new return end

your problem is dependency injection inversion of your goal should be to inject your implementation of instead of monkeypatching and this approach requires some changes to your existing design but for the right reasons your favorite design principle especially the same object should not be responsible for both creating and using other assume the way using looks somewhat like class otherclass public void someclass sc object o some more stuff what you should do is first create your class that implements the same interface or extends and then pass that instance to so your class becomes agnostic to implementation of in this case the code that calls is responsible for passing in the correct implementation whether be the actual or your monkeypatched class extends someclass public object your monkeypatched implementation goes class otherclass public void object o some more stuff
