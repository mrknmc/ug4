3 million records is way too much to handle at my guess is that you are performing an export or something like that which requires that many records to be sent down the one method you could use to reduce this issue would be to have the generate an export and then deliver that file to the client compressing first using zlib or something you are pulling data back to the client for viewing then consider sending summary information and then allowing the client to dig thier way thru the data a portion at a the users would thank you because your performance will go way up and they have to dig thru records they care about looking records is way too much to handle at if you had that many would you be able to carry them but if you made it into larger you if your sending data to the client for a then i strongly suggest a summary give them the large picture and let them drill slowly into the send grouped data and then let them open up this is a search results then set a limit of the number of records to be returned for example to display 100 set the limit to still only display the last record means that there were more than 100 records so the customer needs to adjust thier search criteria to return a smaller

a good first certainly usable as as found i specifically recommend it for an introduction to programming in general prefer python or but it depends on your goals and learning taught programming in c and when approached properly is no more your goal is simply to learn for some particular i really know a better method than going ahead and learning you like you might want to jump into the learning curve is fairly but once through it know a lot of still do learn how to use the vi after would recommend learning the stuff learn vectors rather than use smart rather than ordinary that sort of partly because you should wind up programming like that most and partly because less stuff to remember at you will need to learn the stuff just like need to learn the stuff

a good lint for xlst is quite because validity of xslt templates depends on the parser that is each parser has it own example xalan can be easily extended with custom xpath which are obviously coded in because of that any validator will fail to validate advance first of all you need to know what processor you are going to if you use java based processors i recommend to use eclipse which can validate the templates on the tired two eclipse it is worth mentioning that both support debugging and code xml a commercial can use the following is able to of of name attribute of definition of xslt of of xslt header of xml of xpath of if an xml is associated to of for local and remote files support xml must say that the plugin is really good but on the other hand it open an open source plugin is part of eclipse web tools is quite young in september however it has very active currently it supports only xalan and detects the following errors and xslt imports handle only relative xml catalogs are planed for version above list is definitely incomplete because lack of support for xml catalogs made this project unusable for

a question of memory optimization and loading if you put all your views in one then when your application it has to load the entire xib into memory and construct all of the objects for all of the and this takes a amount of instead you separate your views into separate then your app will start up much because only the xib containing the initial view will be and it will also use less memory at when the view you can load the xib containing the new view this will incur a minor hitch when opening a view for the first if trying to optimize memory you can also unload the previous view when switching but i recommend as this will incur a hitch every time you switch instead of just the first time you switch to any given

add a little to and your difference between a resource is that the garbage collector is aware of managed resources and aware of unmanaged i know that answer very concrete but the difference is help draw the line in the sand here is the short probably riddled with little version of how gc runs and cleans up garbage collector is aware of all managed objects but when garbage collection runs it initially know if any given object is still in use or is elegible to be it determines whether or not it can cleanup an object by initially marking all objects as then traversing from the application root to all referenced each object that has a relationship back to the root either direct or gets marked as reachable and is no longer considered after the gc runs through every reachable object it cleans up the rest since they are no longer in almost all cases working with framework objects you can be assured that objects are managed provides managed wrappers of nearly all unmanaged resources to ensure they are properly cleaned other third party components which hook into the win32 api your components which do are the objects which may be cause for are some objects which can be considered to be somewhat components of the graphics library are one memory really memory leaks in the true typically they occur when you you have removed an object from use but in fact the object still has some reference to the a common example is adding eventhandlers onsomeevent addhandler addressof and not removing are technically not memory leaks since your application is still technically using however if there are enough of them your application can suffer severe performance impacts and may show signs of resource issues unable to attain window an intermediate developer and unfortunately know about these problems i recommend playing with ants profiler to help become familiar with lingering references is a free trial or if you want to get a little bit more research using windbg and to look at the managed if you decide to look into the latter i recommend reading tess she has a lot of great tutorials and advice on using windbg

additional parameters for your callbacks is possible via some kind of delegate function or however it is often considered a bad you may use event property instead to determine your index based on here is a sample of using function return i i var tm timer new will continuously trace numbers from 0 to here is a sample of creating a delegate based on a function void func function return void tm timer new this is a bad approach since unsubscribing for such a listener is a hell this in turn will probably cause some memory which will decrease overall performance of your use with if you know how to work with use them it is a wonderful if you care about your application performance in a long use closures if you are unsure about use a more conventional in your case you could create a that matches your objects to appropriate something like frtoind dictionary new false here prevent garbage collection of filereference i int i stuff with another weird stuff and subscription void in the event listener just look up target in the if var ind int else happen since all filereferences should be in the but if this happens an happy

advantage of declaring it const is that you modify it in an obscure way which code inspection might for example by passing it by reference into a function which modifies its arguable disadvantage is that you pass it into code which takes reference that it actually if you really believe in this is actually an advantage in because it encourages you to make the rest of your code but if you have to make quick changes when or if already published the api and change then it looks to you like a darn good functions are then you really need to tell you whether or not a local variable is going to be explicitly modified by you can see all the uses of the variable right in front of but in real where functions sometimes get and where people use reference parameters and sometimes even and where you want to read and understand code as quickly as then it can help a tend to use it when i and not sweat it if i i get most use out of it when i need to remove const from a that tells me that my original conception of that variable was and i need to carefully check that no expression using it actually relies on it not given that has the const if going to write code that relies on a variable not you may as well get the compiler on your usually not worth worrying about compiler a good compiler can tell that if you modify a and take any references to then it can apply appropriate optimisations whether you mark it const or	
	
advantage of using generics is that it increases the type safety you can only put in the correct type of and you get out the correct type without requiring a the only reason i can think of for not using generic collections is that you need to store some arbitrary am i missing what other reasons are there to not use generics when dealing with would you not use generic

agree that the answer to this question depends on the my current environment there are only two developers and less than a thousand users of our if you can ensure that your programming practices include requirements for implementing the business logic in the application layer than you can successfully handle the constraints outside the you have an application that will need to scale well and will eventually be maintained by a large pool of developers and utilized by an untold number of users potentially implementing data constraints in the database can improve efficiency as well as eliminate potential disaster from changes in the application

all likelihood going to have to take the eav approach described in another and create a data you would then not only be storing the specific data for an but you would also have a table structure for storing data that defines the data in an exam relationships between basically using the relational aspect of your rdbms to create your own relationship sounds it to an though not as much as it might worth it in the long run if you intend for this medical system to be scalable and not store multiple values in one for any a quick exam patient miscellaneous scalar data thats with an exam value exam value is your basic structure for storing exam then you value group group value group value sort very basic and but it hopefully gives you a glimpse into what talking you may want to take it a step further and define specific exam types that have particular then assign an exam type to an but leave that up to	
	
all major desktop browsers support so do many mobile including opera and safari on the the only major browser i know of that support iframes is the blackberry object tag is supported by most but the implementation is extremely inconsistent across the various wrong with just having a flat page with an ordinary navigation if you are only displaying one page at a and the only interface element being placed outside of the iframe is a tab then why not just integrate the tabs into the page layout and do away with the of any sort tend to break the familiar browser behaviors that people are the forward and back navigation and they completely disable the use of when building a you should try not to restrict or dictate to visitors how allowed to browse your if the user wants to open a link a new they should not be left without a navigation if they make their browser window a particular the page content should fill that not a predetermined area specified by the dimensions of the are inherently makes them which is why so few professional websites use cheap broadband is widespread enough these days that reloading a few extra kilobytes of navigational data makes no difference to the overall user

am currently doing a project for school and basically they want us to have this kind of structure all the data access logic the data from the database with either linq of standard a reference to the class library and offering that access the methods from the class a service reference to the web service and using the webmethods to retrieve the basically means that we cannot access the class library directly from the web class of course there are multiple solutions to choose from as to provide abstraction in the web service to separate for example methods that retrieve the articles and methods to retrieve the categories are two different entiries and have two seperate classes in the class can either do one web service which will have all the methods and the website only makes a reference to this one web but of course this will result in having all the methods in a single class a single web i can create multiple web services and reference all of them from the website and then call the one i need depending on what data i need to i mean for the above solutions are not really ideal because if i have the first i will have a ton of methods all in one class abstraction and in the second i will have to reference about 10 different web services from the website for one for school they told us to use the web service web to access the class and then retrieve the data from the class library using the but both solutions i mentioned earlier on seem a bit there a better way of how i might go about in implementing this a webservice as an interface for a data access layer in

am currently reading in depth by jon skeet and have been reading about value and reference got me thinking about the cost of using value types as method parameters due to that value being copied when while this cost is not much when considering what if those value parameters were strings which got passed around numerous there be a benefit to using say a stringbuilder class and passing it instead of a string you considered that the string was say 1024 and was passed around even just a few times between contrast that with a stringbuilder with the same value which would end up passing the value of the reference being 4 or 8 bytes each you could have a considerable performance question may also highlight a vital piece of understanding i may be missing regarding the string feel free to point this out where what what impact would this have on garbage collection regarding the strings in each apparently i did forget one vital piece of information about strings which renders the question null and thanks of passing lots of value types in

am developing a java web application that bases it behavior through large xml configuration files that are loaded from a web as these files are not actually required until a particular section of the application is they are loaded when one of these files are a query is sent to the webservice to retrieve the corresponding as some of the configuration files are likely to be used much more often than others like to setup some kind of caching maybe a 1 hour expiration to avoid requesting the same file over and files returned by the web service are the same for all users across all i do not use jsf or any other fancy just plain question what is considered a best practice to implement such a static cache within a java web is a singleton class or will there be weird behaviors due to the j2ee should i expose something somewhere through what shall i do so that my cache get screwed in clustered environments but not to have one cache per clustered the informations would it be a correct implementation to put an object responsible for caching as a servletcontext i do not want to load all of them at startup and be done with it because that would overload the webservice whenever my application starts the files might change while my application is so i would have to requery them i would still need a globally accessible so my question still using a caching proxy as may be a good but each request to the webservice will send rather large xml query in the post which may be different each only the web application really knows that two different calls to the webservice are actually for your web how to implement caching

am using unity for my ioc but the difference between the containers resides in more than what you can do with is mainly a way to get more loose coupling between disparate parts of your if you wrote a game that you like how it by using di you can change the characters or physics engine in the game without changing other parts of the if someone pays more money they get the more realistic or the better but since nothing else is the testing is testing is also easier with di as you can mock out the for by just changing the implementation that will be used by the without affecting anything you use for you will get access to a very powerful but it may do a great deal that you so look for something i think the best rule is to find the simplest implementation that meets your and use

an explanation in laymans assume you want to fill up a library of and not just stuff them in but you want to be able to easily find them again when you need you decide that if the person that wants to read a book knows the title of the and the exact title to then all it should with the the with the aid of the should be able to go find the book easily and how can you do obviously you can keep some kind of list of where you put each but then you have the same problem as searching the you need to search the the list would be and easier to but you want to search sequentially from one end of the library to the want something with the title of the can give you the right spot at so all you have to do is just stroll over to the right and pick up the how can that be with a bit of forethought when you fill up the and a lot of work when you fill up the of just starting to fill up the library from one end to the you devise a clever little you take the title of the run it through a small computer which spits out a shelf number and a slot number on that this is where you place the beauty of this program is that later when a person comes back in to read the you feed the title through the program once and get back the same shelf number and slot number that you were originally and this is where the book is as others have already is called a hash algorithm or hash and usually works by taking the data fed into it title of the book in this and calculates a number from say that it just converts each letter and symbol into a and sums them all in reality a lot more complicated than but leave it at that for beauty of such an algorithm is that if you feed the same input into it again and it will keep spitting out the same number each so basically how a hash table stuff the size of the the output of such a hash algorithm is inside a range of some large typically much much larger than the space you have in your for say that we have room for exactly one million books in the the output of the hash calculation could be in the range of 0 to one a lot what do we we use something called modulus which basically says that if you counted to the number you wanted the one billion but wanted to stay inside a much smaller each time you hit the limit of that smaller you started back at but you have to keep track of how far in the big sequence that the output of the hash algorithm is in the range of 0 to and you get the value 17 from a particular if the size of the library is only 7 you count and when you get to you start back at since we need to count 17 we have and the final number is course modulus calculation done like done with and the remainder of dividing 17 by 7 is 3 goes 2 times into to and the difference between 17 and 14 is you put the book in slot leads to the next since the algorithm has no way to space out the books so that they fill the library exactly the hash table if you it will invariably end up calculating a number that has been used in the library when you get to the shelf and the slot number you wish to put a book already a book collision handling methods including running the data into yet another calculation to get another spot in the or simply to find a space close to the one you were given right next to the previous this would mean that you have some digging to do when you try to find the book but still better than simply starting at one end of the at some you might want to put more books into the library than the library in other you need to build a bigger since the exact spot in the library was calculated using the and size of the it goes to follow that if you resize the you might end up having to find new spots for all the since the calculation done to find their spots has hope this explanation was a bit more down to earth than buckets and functions

an expression like 2 you usually test bits by shifting the constant 1 to the since that lets the number of bits shifted be the same as the index of the counting the lsb bit as bit number no point in testing the result with a since always going to be either 0 or so you can at least test for something simpler if your language requires c and which by default interpret a integer as the comparison is totally unnecessary and just serves to introduce and increase the risk of write this like extra parenthesis should help make it clearer how things are note how was rewritten as this is not just a you need to compute the proper shift to get the same bit 4 in this course you could put the into subroutines and call to make the code more

an ideal there should be no single point of means a single box with the web pages on it is a having done ha work for a major i would initially propose the each of the four servers has own copy of the at a quiet bring two of the servers modify the ha balancer to remove update the two modify the ha balancer to start using the two new servers and not the two old test that to ensure update the two other servers then bring them how you can do it without extra in the world of the telco i worked what we would have would have had eight servers the we had more money than you could poke a stick when the time came for the four offline servers would be set up with the new the ha balancer would be modified to use the four new servers and stop using the old this made switchover more switchback if we stuffed a very fast and painless when the new servers had been running for a while would we consider the next up until that the four old servers were kept but just in get the same effect with less financial you could have extra disks rather than whole extra recovery be quite as quick since have to power down a server to put the old disk back but it would still be faster than a restore

an interesting going to address concepts around the question rather than answer the question directly i know that much about gcc probably already explored some manipulation of the source code to achieve what you want to some kind char return with with a macro on the function if looking for a compiler then you probably want to modify are some gcc extensions discussed that sound a bit like what going if gcc has anything that does what you probably be documented in the area of the i find anything that sounded exactly like what but perhaps since you understand best what looking know better how to find gdb script would do a pretty good job of outputting but it sounds like got bigger plans than simply doing inserting significant logic into the code seems to be what reminds me of some dynamic linker tricks come across library could insert code around function calls without affecting the original the example encountered was on but there is probably an analog on other came across the option documented instrumentation calls for entry and exit to just after entry and just before function the following profiling functions will be with the address of the current function and its call some does not work beyond the current so the call information may not be available to the profiling functions void void void void i guess this work because you are not able to modify the return value from the profiling

and counting does not make sense on the x86 ask yourself for which cpu counting a all these cpus execute x86 code but all of them have different execution the execution even varies between different steppings of the same last x86 where made sense was the that inside the cpu most instructions are transcoded into microcode and executed out of order by a internal execution unit that does not even remotely look like a the performance of a single cpu instruction depends on how much resources in the internal execution unit is the time for a instruction depends not only on the instruction itself but also on the surrounding you can estimate the resource latency and thus the speed of instructions for different the relevant information can be found at the intel and amd fog has a very nice summary on his since your is a datastructure basic building have you considered using the compiler on win32 you can include and use functions such as give you better execution time because the compiler can inline the always forces the compiler to disable optimizations around the

and my company have just spent the last month or so evaluating umbraco to see wehther it would fit our were looking for an open source replacement to a basic in house cms we had was important that the cms was in and was easy for end users and developers to also needed to be customisable and ticked all these boxes and has an active and helpful community surrounding the documentation is not terribly complete or up to date which can make getting started rather particularly for more complex weak is workflow and page but this is being worked on in the commercial version and is really only a concern for larger scale getting to grips with simple sites creative website starter is excellent and gives you a good grounding in how umbraco works and how to implement a simple cms based most important thing to do before starting an umbraco implementation is to plan your document types and content this is because once implemented it can be hard to change document types on pages you have already created and cms projects invariably live and die in the planning phase anyway so this is no different to any other used many many different cms platforms over the reddot etc etc and found umbraco to be fast and has quirks and in some places lacks polish but overall it is an excellent cms for small to medium sites with a bit of for large as have settled on umbraco and are now in the process of migrating our on our legacy to umbraco as well as a brand new

answer the specific i think there is any way to set up a transaction in the database sense that will do what you think about it and see no guarantee that the various parts of your operation will be handled by the same or quite likely even the same if the request spans database as it will in this the uncommitted parts from one connection will be invisible to the other well as the ideas already consider using one or more tables to hold the incomplete data already then when the user is a single transaction can apply the data to the permanent tables and remove the staging incomplete data can be cleared out on an age criterion by a background process once confident the session has been or held until the user should that better meet your lean towards this approach particularly if i expected to have regular incomplete because this way i have to deal with incomplete data in my main

answer your general question i would say the best way to handle database connections in java is to avoid the its ok for testing or learning about jdbc but not for real production if you have a data source that does not have its own jdbc driver but it has an odbc driver then you may not have a main reason why i suggest that you stay away from it though is that it makes it difficult to deploy your you have to set up the data source on the machine that you are running your application if you have access to the machine no but suppose you are sending the application off to the the pure java jdbc driver works better for this because it is included as part of your application so once your application is installed it is ready to connect to the data course depending on your requirements there are two other types of drivers but thats another

application by itself with default priority cannot make a system however kernel can and an application do much without calling the kernel has many mechanisms that take precedence over regular running those these have the highest say if you have a device with problem the system will become these come second in the dpcs are basically deferred interrupt processing when a dpc is running multitasking is esentially disabled scheduler itself is a dpc if you have a designed device driver queuing too many dpcs the system may become these are like dpcs but run in a certain thread they are mostly used to copy results to process passive level code cannot run before apcs are is windows cache which works on a separate higher priority thread to write changes in a file to acting as a lazy write this thread takes precedence over regular threads and long running flush operations can hinder system on pagefile volume causes paging operations to be delayed for multiple even if on a different partition have the this can slow down anything on the try the same app on a different disk to see the these mechanisms are involved in a single file so depending on the storage device driver you filter drivers you have installed on the you might end up with an this is usually not the case with device say your is running on a different disk than the then i would recommend starting with perfmon to understand going drill down to sub categories memory manager to understand taking the most process explorer also helps to see dpc and interrupt execution if anything around you might have a buggy otherwise there may be a filter driver interfering with

approach is a bad idea for a couple of but first some is an array of 0 which i even think is permitted for stack when declaring an array like this you must specify the maximum number of values you will ever is super if you do specify a number less and you use then you will cause a memory overwrite which at best crashes and at worst causes strange bugs that are a nightmare to track next problem is this i this line does is take the value stores in the address specified by and add what you want is to get the value at nth element of the address specified by like but you should take five minutes to think about a better way to do reasons i mentioned a bad idea need to iterate over the entire array anytime you require its can never store the terminating element this case in the i would suggest you maintain a separate value that stores the number of elements in the a very common way of doing this is to create a class that wraps this concept block of elements and the current standard library comes with a template class named which can be used for this not quite the same as an array must add items first before but very it also provides support for which is handy your program written to use instead of the function added something to print out the using namespace for i i cout cout return	
	
approach is fine use that quite a long you control the it work with java clients if you know you will never need to support then it can be but it breaks some purist soa in an intranet scenario is one where i might consider this and the ide have options to types from existing assemblies to do exactly another advantage of this approach is if you want to use the same validation logic at the without coding it twice for example

approach to scalability is within a single scaling across machines is a tougher the short answer there scala and lift do anything to either help or hinder horizontal far as actors within a single lift achieves better scalability because a single instance can handle more concurrent requests than most other to i first have to point out the flaws in the classic handling bear with this is going to require some typical framework uses a thread to service a page when the client the framework assigns a thread out of a that thread then does three it reads the request from a it does some computation involving to the and it sends a response out on the at pretty much every the thread will end up blocking for some when reading the it can block while waiting for the when doing the it can block on disk or network it can also block while waiting for the while sending the it can block if the client receives data slowly and tcp windows get filled the thread might spend 30 of time it spends of its on that one jvm can only support so many threads before it really slows thread contention for entities connection pools and and native os limits all impose restrictions on how many threads a jvm can if the jvm is limited in its maximum number of and the number of threads determines how many concurrent requests a server can then the number of concurrent requests will be determined by the number of are other issues that can impose lower for threads are a fundamental limiting but not the only decouples thread from in a request does tie up a a thread does an action reading the then sends a message to an actors are an important part of the because they are scheduled via a pool of threads gets used to process messages within important to avoid blocking operations inside of so these threads get returned to the pool that this pool visible to the part of support for a request currently blocked on database or disk for keep a thread the request handling thread is almost to receive more method for decoupling requests from threads allows a lift server to have many more concurrent requests than a also like to point out that the grizzly library supports a similar approach without more concurrent requests means that a single lift server can support more users than a regular java ee

approaches that test the existence of are because there is no way to check whether a file exists and create it in a single atomic because of there is a race condition that make your attempts at mutual exclusion you need to use creates a directory if it exist and if it it sets an exit more it does all this in a single atomic action making it perfect for this mkdir echo is already exit all see the excellent you want to take care of stale comes in the only downside here is that the operation takes about a so it a function i wrote once that solves the problem using mutex open a mutual exclusion lock on the unless another process already owns if the file is already locked by another the operation this function defines a lock on a file as having a file descriptor open to the this function uses fd 9 to open a lock on the to release the close fd exec local pid pids exec for pid in exec return 1 locked by a done can use it in a script like echo exit you care about portability solutions should work on pretty much any unix offers some additional options and there is also	
	
appropriate to use floating point types when dealing with scientific or statistical these will invariably only significant digits of to whether to use single or double precision floating point this depends on your need for accuracy and how many significant digits you typically though people just end up using doubles unless they have a good reason not example if you measure distance or weight or any physical quantity like that the number you come up with it has a certain number of significant digits based on the accuracy of your instruments and your calculations involving anything like floating point numbers are if dealing with irrational numbers floating point types are appropriate really your only eg linear algebra where you deal with square roots a is different because you typically need to be exact and every digit is

are a couple of different approaches and you could certainly use firstly you could remove some common code in to a separate project and just call that code this is pretty easy to do and i sometimes take this approach with simple helper functions that probably belong in a class in my main project a good example would be a math library or something like the other approach is to extract common functionality in to a class or interface which you then inherit and depending on what code you are looking to reuse you might use either of these suspect you will find it easier than you try it with some simple set up a new project in the same reference your library from your existing code and see how it there is also no reason not to reference your shared project in multiple solutions shared code libraries need not be a problem if the development gets handed for now you can have your 2 sites reference the same library which you but if and when you split the projects out to other teams you can give a copy of the shared code to each	
	
are a few big benefits to using a framework over sure very proud of the fact that slung enough js to be able to write animations from you should abstracting common functionality away from yourself is actually very you just call the method and know the innards will be and executed even if very fast at writing the stuff still time spent on that instead of solving using a common framework is like speaking a common you can collaborate with other developers very and each can pick up where others left off without to stepping into an application which uses a homegrown library for the things jquery can the people working on jquery are javascript i am really good at and you probably are but a big difference between normal good and jquery a team of insanely good people are constantly poring over a small set of common functionality tuning tweaking enhancing it to make it the best it can possibly that represents a huge number of a single person like you or me simply cannot no matter how good we and if you as good as the jquery you can only benefit by combining your talent with theirs and contributing to the jquery a melting pot of insane

are a of issues at play terms of pure performance and things like indexes are set up databases are very good at one query in sorting at the the database is probably in practice the database often becomes the bottleneck for an anything you can do to move work away from the database will improve your overall application that includes moving sort operations to a or presentation the presentation tier may not be able to sort one query as but it might be better positioned to handle that overall this is especially true when you can reliably push that work all the way to individual though that can be the other more to consider here than pure you also want to think about future more maintainable than a simple only one line of compared to who knows how much extra programmer work to get a sort working this might be a case where better off throwing some money at the problem to make sure your database is simply able to maintain an level of sorts and here the issue cut and a school of thought that believes sorting really should be considered a function of the presentation tier and that ultimately the presentation tier is also the more maintainable place to do this i subscribe to that but it is out

are controls that are children of a naming control have their full ids built by appending ids of their parents using in case of a this is necessary to differentiate between multiple instances of the same child control why and not i guess because many people already tend to name their controls and the symbol is as good as the is the right id and why used as a name for controls such as when post back the framework needs to be able to match form keys with appropriate confusion with i comes from the fact that an id you are using inside and the id you see in html are two different the ids are just for whatever when a control gets rendered clientid all get replaced with my guess is that this was done to make it about that you really should try avoiding it whenever findcontrol is a recursive which breaks into and finds gridview2 and asks if it has the as a child the process repeats for each part separated by a side whenever you find yourself calling for some deeply buried you need to examine the pattern and ask for whatever needs to be done with the most likely needs to be done with a as in that it probably needs to be handled on onitemcreated or on where you have access to a row who about

are not at least they many developers talked to seem to find my view of web standards slightly but stay with me you try to create the standard before the you have several long delay before useful implementations nobody has a working implementation to and since nobody is using any of the features it exist there is little impetus to actually implement a type of potential for standards that cannot actually be who knows for sure until somebody actually tries the hla standard was a good example of this to the point where the dod had to write an memo that attempted to set the de facto standard by glossing over some of the errors in the actual potential for standards that serve any practical do people actually want see example at which has fallen into a i think of anybody met who found the css does not including box model to be inability for implementers of the standard to distinguish their products from their resulting in a stubborn desire to break with the standard in practical or see example at think that the w3c learned this the hard way in recent some of the most visible innovation has come from a new browser examples would be html5 canvas xmlhttprequest outlook web access input range rss and the video element came from the proprietary level on not from the standards tower on and these new were forged by looking at these past individual implementations copied microsoft largely for and so not by some think tank pondering the the netscape plugin and sql are all examples of where breaking changes are done gradually in a standard should be a least common denominator that smooths over the basic differences in a pidgin language that works across all of and not an enumeration of robert prescriptive rules about a language or because then you end up with rules that always make sense or apply a ideal trying to apply grammar rules to a like trying to apply grammar rules to an oh this is what the greatest defect in the css standard at this point is that there really a good way to specify that a page was written against a particular version of the we can specify doctypes for our html why i indicate that a document was written for css this will only become more important as we start adding more and more bizarre features to css that affect the actual content of the such as a future version of the standard is going to have errors one day that potentially break and be nice to let the document author ask for certain behavior rather than have browsers attempt to figure out the the lighter now that ie8 and ie7 are things really as bad as they were a specific ie6 stylesheet served with conditional comments can really go a long way to making a implementation the other advice is to to take the fluid layout and hope that someone else has done most of the troubleshooting for a compatible web site is standard or no you can make it easier on yourself if you accept that there will be some differences in the way different browsers render your be afraid of proprietary extensions by any means all right to have css3 rounded corners for your but have a for when they exist the rounded corners critical for using the and let your users choose how like to consume your

are several factors at work files have no intrinsic metadata for describing their encoding all the talk of there are reasons xml is default encoding for windows is still an 8bit character set with a limited range of values text files written in this format are not tell a unicode file from an ansi windows apps rely on the presence of a order at the start of the file strictly true raymond chen in the bom is there to tell you the of the for even though there is only one byte windows apps rely on the marker bytes to automatically figure out that it is unicode note that notepad has an encoding option on its is wrong to say that java is broken because it does not write a bom on unix it would be an error to write a bom to a script for and many unix systems use as their default there are times when you want it on like when appending data to an existing new is a method of reliably appending data to a private static void boolean string throws ioexception boolean skipbom append closer res new try outputstream out writer writer if finally public static void throws ioexception string chinese boolean append if the file already existed and you chose to append and existing data the only thing that code will create is a is the type used in this class closer implements closeable private closeable public extends t closeable return public void throws ioexception if code makes a best guess about how to read the file based on byte order private static final private static charset throws ioexception for encodings bom for b if continue return return private static string throws ioexception closer res new try inputstream in inputstream bin reader reader stringbuilder out new for ch ch ch return finally public static void throws ioexception uses the default so whether it prints anything sensible depends on your platform and	
	
are several problems with the example you number one problem is that you are selecting the columns using jquery inside the this is a major performance if you have any control over the html code i would suggest you use normal dom methods to get the desired colum you want to sort note that sometimes when you might expect a table cell you may get a text get back to that a for loop is faster so you may consider using that instead of but i suggest you benchmark took your example and created a table with 1000 it took about 750ms on my machine to sort i did some optimizations code and managed to get it down to the sorting itself took around 20ms sb i i x rows columnindex t new new return new tbody delete you write for speed you want each iteration to be as quick as so do stuff in the loops that you can do outside of for moving outside of the last loop sped things up for using dom methods to access a what you need is the column so you could iterate over the th columns until you find the correct one the html formatting is identical for th tags and td you can then use that index to get the correct row child if the table is static and the users are liable to do more sorting on you should cache the rows and not delete the sortkey then you save about sort there is also the matter of the table if the content is this sorting method is if it contains numbers then you need to consider since i am using localecompare which is a method of the string

are working on a similar implementation to what you are describing as a proof of what we see as an for us consists of three separate servers to accomplish is a that is responsible for generating the indices that will be there is a service implementation that handles the workflows used to build these as well as being able to signal completion custom management api exposed via wcf web are two access to the api is provided via wcf services to the they sit behind a physical load balancer and will periodically the publication server to see if there is a more current set of indicies than what is currently if it it requests a lock from the publication server and updates the local indices by initiating a transfer to a local once it is just a matter of suspending the searcher while the index is it then releases its lock and the other server is available to do the i we are only approaching the proof of concept stage with as a replacement for our current which is a load balanced endeca the size of the indices and the amount of time it will take to actually complete the tasks required are the larger questions that have yet to be proved some random things that we are downtime of a given server could be reduced if two local folders are used on each machine receiving data to achieve a are looking to see if the load balancer allows programmatic access to have a node remove and add itself from the this would lessen the chance that a user experiences a hang if accesses during an are looking at in the event that cluster manipulation is not looked at while a lot of it just works out of the we have some bench time to explore this path as a learning exercise learning things like improving our wf and wcf and implementing mvc for a management worst case we go with something like but have gained experience in some skills we are looking to improve

arithmetic between operands of different types is legal but the c standard defines rules for type promotion in order to convert the operands to a common automatic type promotion allows the compiler to do something sensible for but does not necessarily mean really know whether or not the behavior is correct you must first understand the rules for promotion and then understand the representation of the data in general types are converted to longer types to to types are converted to conversions favor avoiding data loss signed is converted or depends on the size of the respective code like and have different is right or wrong depends on the values that and can in my experience common practice to prohibit the coding implicit type the programmer must consider the context and explicitly perform any type conversions

been designing and developing software for windows mobile and windows ce in and for quite a few years i been doing so for honeywell hand held purchased by honeywell in where worked on nearly all aspects of the from drivers and services to line of business guis and of i tell you one language is better than the i probably spend a split of my time with and each platform definitely has their own place in the mobile will give a suggestion that you likely stay away from any device that runs an os as old as wince especially if you are even considering the reasoning for this is that only at cf embedded in rom of the os rom meaning that you would require a cab file to install at least cf you could develop with cf not worth the pain of using such an old most wince devices these days come with cf installed in the rom so i would at least look for that same you may even want to consider using a device with windows mobile or as they are easy to program with and will always have cf in case wondering why i have not mentioned cf or cf just because the first mobile platform to be release with those versions will be windows mobile which is not out though you can always install the framework if you want wince definitely gives you a more look and feel to its gui over its windows mobile so that is all a matter of your programming preference and what your end users want and comments on sdks being only a thing this is just not if you have a proper sdk you should have all of the same access to any devices or drivers that you would in but with the ease of for honeywell provides an extensive sdk for all of our devices in vb and and the portion of the sdk actually has functionality than the you will have to do a with our code from you want to take a look at the sdk talking freely available to download and has some great i would actually consider the provided sdk as more important than the hardware in many cases most of the the hardware for the devices is pretty much the they all have arm laser or image based i looked at the intermec link you posted and it look like that unit actually has a built in you using an external scanner hooked to the a look at the honeywell offering if you want got devices with probably the best imager based bar code scanner in the built into all of our and we have a rock solid sdk should i wrote a lot of and the sdk provides extremely access to all of the hardware on the stop my sales pitch for one language over the really all depends on what exactly you want to and services be written in anything but native c or so is out for anything like and can absolutely be your friend on mobile devices in terms of keeping things since you need the whole framework to run the

been teaching myself cell processor programming for the last couple of it is definitely not the best place to since successfully programming the cell requires mastering a lot of the various types of communication on the cell atomic to make this the documentation for the cell can be hard to and if you use a more common platform there will be a much larger community of that is not to say that there any community of users for the just that it is and even though there are other environments where one might find it can be difficult to translate techniques for these environments to the due to its unique using a standard ps3 with linux allow you to access the graphics not all learning the will teach you a lot about programming close to the you really have any as there are not very many abstractions available to the each spu on the cell has 256kb of local memory and if you need more than then you will need to figure out some sort of scheme to issue the correct dma requests to bring the right values into memory at the right time and keep the spu busy doing something while that dma request is in learning the maybe not the best platform for but given that you have the opportunity to take classes from this sounds like a good any if you are the from is a great and has a couple of chapters about game programming on the cell with the ogre which might also be interesting to

been thinking of a dynamic way of creating a captcha that uses morphing shapes or dynamic first idea is to have a flash or that gradually changes say a square into a the user will be required to click the button when it becomes spherical idea is to have an area of color that slowly changes red to blue and the user will be required to press a button when it becomes blue idea is a combination of both say the difficulty will be to match the clicks with the but it should be hard for automated code to detect shades or people please offer some comments on my for the now considering using a flash based video playback of a server fed video feed of a few colored shapes that morph into other colored the user will be required to pause the feed when the colors and shapes match some canned such as click on the video when you see two green squares turn into 3 blue the shapes will be amongst over overlapping and moving morphing fun for the whole for morphing

been using mercurial for a little but mainly for my own now i have a project working on where two of us are building the same and we will probably be modifiying each would like to setup a mercurial repository on a make that repository the so my changes and the other changes both push to that server basically the i like mercurial though and want to switch to something like in my own everything is done on and my has so pushing my changes work on multiple from one computer to the server is just a matter of the protocol used is for transfering the problem is that i use the server will be windows no and the other editor will be using windows as far as i the best way of working in mercurial in these types of setups is for the repository to pull changes from the rather then the source pushing to the behind several entirely my and my computer be visible from the and assuming the other editor will be behind a firewall too we just start up the local mercurial http server and get the computer to pull from the best way for both editors to get our changes to the server should add that the server is a server on the so it is just as visible as something like a hosted windows but i would probably have permission to install software if needed for

best not to put a relative path into if the current directory changes during execution if you are running from a different directory to the script it if you want to make it relative to the use the character should be escaped to for and really it ought to be using instead of relying on windows path if another imported script has played with it have pulled the wrong path also reloads of your own modules will best leave the path where it name parts your path includes the segment so effectively trying since is already in the path you added to search what you really want is name is a so it should be if you really want to have it write to your local almost certainly want leave the fromlist that module is a module object and wants a module you already have the module why not just reaction to all this is much this overly difficult for yourself and creating a lot of potential problems and fragility by messing around with the internals of the import this is tricky stuff even for experienced python would almost certainly be better off using plain old python modules which you import the list of commands is really no great having all your commands in a with repeat the filenames but is much simpler and more robust than a surfeit of

calling you inherit in the classical sense of the word instead you tell child to apply parents prototype onto itself and thus has cloned properties and methods from this has no issues performance wise whatsoever though so abandoning prototype for efficiency reasons is not a valid i can be honest i think enforcing oo paradigms onto javascript is the biggest mistake a javascript developer can much like having to learn to deal with immutability in functional programming trying to make javascript behave like classical oo will only work against you in the long answer your question but tons of different ways to apply super functionality to none of which i can recommend though as no definitive version that come with a downside somewhere down the

can also check ics	
	
can also do this using dom level 2 css all but which uses its own is a theoretical advantage in this compared to the in that you have to worry about putting special html characters in the but in practice style elements are cdata in legacy and and are rarely used in stylesheets do need a stylesheet in place before you can started appending to it like that can be any existing active embedded or it if there the only standard way to create it at the moment is with	
	
can also have a public const string in one of your that represents the build and use it in all your for the different of course this would have to be in a project that are referenced by all the other in order to is a good if you like the idea to reference the same in all your this also works when you use multiple languages and in my	
	
can also just use a create a delegate for the method that does the then call begininvoke on the passing it the and a callback function to handle the return values you after the begininvoke you can wait a designated time for the asynch delegate to and if it does not in that specified move public delegate list callerservicedelegate callsvcdel datetime cutoffdate iasyncresult ar put while if returntype returnvalue whatever else you need to do to handle whatever you need to do to handle as written asynchcallback could be as the code retrieves the return value from the but if you want to you can have the method call the asynchcallback delegate and pass it the return values

can also unconditionally add the delimiter and after the loop remove the extra delimiter at the then an list is empty then return this at the beginning will allow you to avoid the check at the end you cannot remove characters from an empty the question really a loop and an what do you think is the clearest way to have these ravn	
	
can also use i know youre relatively new to this so let me try to it has 2 generic the first one being the type of the array it wants to call it and the second one the type you want to convert to call it it accepts an array of type i and returns an array of type the second parameter is a converter applying the naming we have its signature goes o body of the delegate must contain the code necessary to do the inside the convertall the code iterates thru each of the values in the input array and passes then to the the value returned by the delegate is then stored into an output the output array is returned to the user once all values are proxymetadata convertedarray proxymetadata returnvalue new return

can be a tricky one to if not using dynamically generated the biggest culprit is generally client side scripts modifying the data that the controls are bound for adding another list item to a dropdownlist using javascript will trigger this as the server will notice that the added item was not part of the original you are using dynamic you will have to ensure that the controls and their data are created the same way on every i run into irreconcilable event validation i usually disable it on the this is supposedly a security but i have yet to see an exploit relying on event validation being turned maybe ask that on to see if anyone knows of easy to sanitize your page and should be done without even thinking about whether event validation will protect you or

can be passed in function and it can be returned via the return value of the	
	
can be super beneficial on even a single core machine is parallel disk io is a pretty large factor in the build spawning two compiler instances per cpu core can actually increase as one compiler instance blocks on io the other one can usually jump into the cpu intensive part of need to make sure got the ram to support this be a problem on a modern otherwise end up swapping and that defeats the gnu make you can just use where is the number of simultaneous processes to make sure you have your dependency tree right before trying it though or the results can be tool really useful the parallel make is it works a treat with gcc you can use gcc or something with a similar command line distcc actually breaks up the compile task by pretending to be the compiler and spawning tasks on remote you call it in the same way as call and you take advantage of option to call many distcc one of my previous jobs we had a fairly intensive linux operating system build that was performed almost daily for a adding in a couple of dedicated build machines and putting distcc on a few workstations to accept compile jobs allowed us to bring build times down from a half a day to under 60 minutes for a complete os userspace a lot of other tools to speed compiles you might want to investigate more than creating ram something which looks like it will have very little gain since the os is doing disk caching with os designers spend a lot of time getting caching right for most they are smarter than you so i like to try and do better than you chew up ram for ram disk the os has less working ram to cache data and to run your code end up with more swapping and worse disk performance than otherwise you should profile this option before completely discarding

can make constructors especially for immutable types are important for here for a full not as nice as it be but nicer than having lots of you obviously use object initializers with immutable so the foo name settle foo can be extended to the general idea of simplifying but in cases prefer overloads that advertise the legal constructors are a bit since you are just defining the initial com side of things is also important to a lot of but i simply use much com interop so this important to re why they just use the same syntax that attributes simple it can be ambiguous with other members variables an issue with take the namespace uses one regular parameter the and one named so suppose we use this for regular named secondarg could also be a used a method for what if we have a variable or a property called this would be ambiguous between using as a named argument to and to and passing as a regular this is legal in static void string static void string secondarg secondarg could be a alternative syntax have this this section by sorry for adding this but not really a unique answer and too long for the comments and includes you hinted at the ambiguity but your example highlight the deciding i think the example you gave points out something that could be but the required around object initializers prevents an underlying syntactical my explanation for the following code is embedded as the block sealed class someattribute public public public int the true when you add an and only in this there would be no way without a new syntax to use named arguments with this is a particular problem because attributes are a prime candidate constructor simplification for immutable data this calls the constructor with 1 this calls the constructor with 0 followed by setting a class

can put the implications into two first is how it affects your application using unsafe code requires that your assembly be run in a full trust not possible to run in a restricted environment such as certain click once security the reason being that unsafe code prevents the clr from ensuring type click once though with no security restrictions should not have a second is what it means for the way you using unsafe code typically involves using pointers and in using them to performed advanced marshalling via there is nothing inherently wrong with either of these actions it just requires significantly more understanding of the clr and marshalling than code object pinning is a great example of knowledge need to have a firm grasp on before you started using these

can see a couple of things one is that the code for the two loops looks the compiler will probably realise that the variable and the variable will always have the same value and optimise one of them you should look at the generated assembly and see what is really going theory is that the change to the inner body of the loop has affected the cachability of the code this could have moved it across cache lines or some other the code is so you may find it difficult to get an accuate timing even if you are doing 5000 you may find that the time is inside the margin for error for the timing code you are a modern computer can probably run that in far less than a millisecond perhaps you should increase the number of see the generated assembly in the compiler how can i peek at the assembly generated by how can i create a file where i see the c code and its translation use the capital to and it will emit the code to a file with a for the following leave the generated assembly on the file you want to see the c code with the assembly it was converted use a command line like will output the listing to the

certain site i know recently upgraded their bandwith from tb monthly to is they went over the limit complaining they know how to get down the bandwidth thing i seen them consider is the fact that jpeg and other images that are displayed on the it is an can contain where the picture was taken and of the matter this information is of no importance whatsoever on that not gonna be yet still adding to the since it increases the filesize of every images from a few bytes to a few a site that uses up more then tb per stripping the several thousands images of their metadata will help decrease the bandwidth usage at least by a few gigabytes per month i if not is there a way to do this in and for the allready existing does anybody know a automatic metadata i know of png but not very might be usefull for initial cleaning an image stripped of metadata upon upload in

combine both whenever you make a tag tags should never so the presence of a tag is an indicator that you be trying to release anything else as the same when it came time to do put it onto a so the flow branch trunk to tag this new as and then bug fixes can be done on the branch avoid getting mixed up with any development that may already be on trunk and merged into each release of the fixed is tagged as from the this is basically the approach we use at work with and very similar indeed to through the i think virtually identical to far as the comment about tags being redundant because you have revision largely except that tags also specify a which files in the repository are covered by the you can reasonably ask someone to look at and they are immediately looking at a coherent if you ask them to look at revision they have to first look at revision x to see that it was changing and hence deduce that is what they should be looking what happens if revision x touched files in proj1 and which is of course but strictly speaking you should be saying and where is the list of revision numbers how do we know that is revision it should imho be possible to determine that just from the systems like tags and branches are still basically the same thing references to the object but the is that tag refs and branch refs do preferably with a specific constraint on how they perforce also has which are ways of grouping a set of file revisions together independently of a which is essentially a but more historically used changelist numbers to subversion revision qualified with the name of the branch they should be on to identify the two are almost identical any so here i guess

company has a large customer that has many each location can have its own set of servers with its own the users of the system are centrally administered thru a the computers in this network are locked down with only http access to the there is a company wide sharepoint all servers and computers are windows based server have written a number of utilities for some are loaded from the but an increasing number of these are installed directly to a users typically we have been configuring these tools thru or this is becoming cumbersome to update if a server is updated or settings need to be not concerned with how the data is like to have a common way to find or locate this the method will have to contend with certain knowing what the user is on and return an appropriate have to cache this data locally on the machine in case the network fails to happen every so already thought of a couple of but have no idea how effective or practical these tools technologies can i use enterprise wide to configure locally installed to store enterprise configuration

company i work for creates applications for the blackberry been working on a proprietary that allows us to embed code within our applications and have the applications report back some stats to our central servers every time the system works however only in beta with hits per the are sent to the servers without a built a very solid api to handle the acceptance and storage of the hits a mysql tested the load and we should be able to accommodate hundreds of thousands of hits per hour without a not really a problem is showing the built a display panel similar to it shows the hits over each the past the fist version ran straight queries pulling data from the hits table and interpreting it on the that work for very our current solution is that the hits are for processing and we have a cron come through every 5 minutes taking the hits and sorting them into for each this works amazing and incredibly it only works for 1 since the entire company has access to dealing with a few hundred users in various what i define as in san jose is much different than what my colleague in london defines as since the current solution is only cached to 1 a nightmare for anyone checking the data outside of our current plan to fix this is to create caches for every timezone in that would mean that multiplying the amount of data by terrible to me and given that the caches can be very multiplying it just sounds like a bad when we go to process the going to take a lot more cpu time to put them in 40 different one else have a better idea of how to solve this for such a long not exactly easy to thanks way to design a scaleable

company is currently in the process of creating a large software package in we have taken a soa approach to the structure and i was wondering whether anyone has any advice as to how to make it extensible by users with programming would involve a approval by the administrator of a production system to allow a specific plugin to be and also the actual plugin architecture want to allow the users to write scripts to perform common modify the layout of the user interface in and add new functionality allowing charting of tabulated does anyone have any suggestions of how to implement or know where one might obtain the knowledge to do this kind of was thinking this would be the perfect for releasing the software with a restrictive license on not keen on allowing the competition access to our source thought just clarify to explain why i chose the answer i i was referring to production administrators external to my company the and giving them someway to things in an easier manner without requiring them to have a full knowledge of are mostly with limited programming i was thinking more of a this may be an out of reach goal and the managed extensibility framework seems to offer the best compromise so without	
	
company maintains two svn repository 1 and repository repository has multiple projects in and is only accessed by the developers within the access is through https and authentication is through the windows repository has a single project in and is accessed by the developers within the and our access is through and authentication is through the passwd have some code in a folder in repository 1 that we would like to be downloaded to users of repository the obvious answer is to use svn but as far as i can that would need the developers to have accounts on our and our it people like the only solution i can see is some kind of cron job that runs periodically to copy the necessary files from repository 1 to found a tool called which claims to do what i but so far not managed to get it to work i spend more time trying to get tailor to does anyone have any suggestions of another my last resort is to knock up a program to do it for which be too but always best to use an existing app if there is in advance for any copy revisions from one svn repository to another active svn

complexity is just one variable that impacts the overall performance of a other factors might include network latency or network especially when the size of the returned data is you run the same algorithm on a local you will get the results faster than if you run the algorithm on a machine on another continent and need the same results sent over the factors might include raw cpu speed if the calls are done on physically different why premature optimisation is the root of all say it depends even more now on the details of the what database software you are or whether or not your web service is reading data from a static web page or dynamically generating the i am beginning to lose sight of why you are asking the you seem to say that both methods take the same amount of so if they take the same amount of how can you ask which is clearly they are equally you need to tell us more about how and when they stop taking the same amount of

config directives can live inside location blocks they are not and very common to do this is you should have no trouble setting this up using only 1 instance of of the great things about this is that you can set it up this way initially and then change your mind later by switching the location block to pass through to a backend server without any of that being visible to the outside go ahead and do it on one server knowing that you can put in a backend server or cluster later as you need to scale	
	
confusing api is the eternal bane of library make it even for people to decide exactly what they want to do given the interface you if they must pick from a lengthy list of overloaded probably too much cognitive worth noting that 4 will have support for optional and named so your problem will go away by it frowned upon in terms of favors the responsibility or if you have a single class with many of these each having many that suggests that it may be doing too it decrease in you have a lot of overloads for the same it takes longer to resolve each function call method with this name is the right but not going to have a impact on performance if nonvirtual calls that where the compiler can statically know exactly what type something is going to either i think that should be your motivating factor

currently we split reviews into two reviews happen just per one or sometimes two other people but sometimes entirely unrelated coders to help spread expertise and get fresh comes over and sits with the the author then walks through the commenting on changes as reviews are a bit more like formal a coder who is not guided by the original author reviews the change usually typically an with a list of comments is the result experimenting with reviews are mandatory for all when we hit we typically start doubling up on the warm reviews two others will attend rather than just reviews are mostly for catching your own as an and for spreading understanding and catching the occasional they also help junior people come up to speed with our coding standards and best programmers are not allowed to be reviewed by other due to some issues with that in the reviews are usually reserved for larger checkins or groups of we use these for offsite for initial system commits of or and for or intrusive reviews are generally best for finding deeper structural issues or deep logic or error handling also try to get people to write up really fast design before launching into any given coding idea is write one to three of these a format is up to you you can use a bulleted task even sometimes get photos of a whiteboard that has been used in a meeting about a goal is to keep mdds short and in most more formal design docs can be set up as for larger in game we tend toward which necessarily obsoletes most large docs pretty reviews are usually quick on the doc by all interested parties and other

currently writing a custom server control in my idea is to create some sort of collapsible panel control the first server control so what i wanted to have is that the user defines my control in this way in the control should then render on the final page as submit button has then an on the control which the panel first approach was to create a server control that inherits from inside the collapsiblepanel control i then created another panel in the oninit i did something like the override void for i i control control basically took all the controls which are currently present inside my control and add them to the control list of the internally created panel furthermore i added the button which then does the of then problem is that somehow the rendering work the button and the pnlcontent are rendered out just the controls inside the pnlcontent are not the output is like the pnlcontent is someone suggest me a solution for this what i did wrong with the i override the default rendering of the panel i inherit since i thought this be necessary because i modify its control structure in the so it should render out my the moment i found a i basically did it the same way it is most often done in the microsoft ajax control i created a socalled which render itself but just adds so now i add the the id of the panel to collapse to my collapsiblepanelextender control and it does then the job of maybe also the better and cleaner solution but i still would like to know what went wrong in my first approach i described for any server controls

did some benchmarks in an article about peter zaitsev done a simple benchmark to see performance of query row point standard prepared and have it served from query prepared statements give which is better than 2000 with statements but it is still well 4470 when results served from query seems to say that the of using prepared statements is that they are than using a straight query at least in this simple the relative difference probably diminishes with a more complex query or a larger result seems that prepared queries would be given the double to the server and other benchmark lacks you should run your own because the type of query you and your environment and are definitely important for query it was true in the past that prepared statements were incompatible with caching query but this was see the query cache in the mysql mysql statements do not use the query beginning with statements use the query cache certain which depending on the preparation documentation goes on to describe these go read do recommend using prepared statements for quoting variables as you interpolate them into sql statements can be effective if you do it but even quoting may have some subtle security with character sets mysql bug easier to use prepared queries in a secure way in these

do agree with carlos that using event subscription in the view is not a good as far as i understand it leads to eliminate any code behind from the view and i really like it of the proprs of the mvvm is ability to unit test but i still beleive that view model can be tested even if it popups all we need is just to use window with initialized content with needed view i think there could be 2 possible situations when vm should open new either to show window or to show a window which is dependent on the business in the first case new window code is the only code of the command for or in the second case we have some decision making logic which opens the but in any case we can move the code which opens new window into separate and when testing our vm just to mock this even this separate class can be some kind generic windowscontroller which will tracks all windows in the but still we can say that view model opens popup using helper windowscontroller and view does not know anything else about other all business logic stays incapsulated into model and view

do not agree with the current accepted foremost important aspect of multicore machines is that and main memory are far this means that unless the application is or easy to it is highly likely that it would be memory rather than cpu floating point multiplication takes about 4 clock while a memory fetch from main memory takes hundreds of clock exploiting cache locality becomes if the achieved performance on single core is sufficient of the applications would belong the this there is no need to but if it is not your application is much more responsive since they then you would do better to refactor your application to better exploit parallelism and cache the refactored application would consist of relatively independent less which run in parallel for for a good overview on multicore and the way things are the major points they say speed is not increasing anymore as it is more cost effective to manufacture more number of simpler than a small number of fast memory is far from a few there will be of in web 100s on so plan to scale your application to 100s or 1000s of this means you should create several independent are difficult to work therefore work with

driving ui is problematic because you often know what you want on the screen until you see it on the for that gui development tends to be massively iterative and therefore very difficult to drive with does not mean that we just abandon tdd for we push as much code as we possibly can out of the leaving behind only simple wiring that wiring allows us to make the massively iterative changes we without affecting the essence of the technique was probably best described by michael feathers some years ago in an article entitled humble dialog it is also the fundamental idea behind the pattern that caused such a stir four years and has now been split into the passive view and supervising controller the article link in this question takes advantage of these but in a rather than a idea is to test drive everything except the we even need to write the view for a good long the view is so absurdly simple that it probably need any kind of unit tests at or if it they can in fact be written test drive the supervising controller you simply make sure you understand how the data will be presented on the you need to know where the data or what the font or what color it or any of the other cosmetic issues that cause the massive iteration of you know one data item will be some kind of text another will be a still another will be a button or a check and then you make sure that the view can ask all the questions it needs to ask to get these items rendered example the text box may have a default the view should be able to ask for the menu may have some items the view should be able to ask for this the questions that the view asks are all about and are devoid of business the same the view will tell the supervising controller when anything the controller will modify the data including any kind of validation and error and then the view can ask how that data should be of this can be test driven because all decoupled from the visual all about the data is manipulated and and about what it looks so it need to be massively

dynamic sql can be more efficient for the some of the comments here seem to endorse my view that dynamic sql can be confusing to the human especially when they write the code of the person who will inherit your prefer static sql in a and make the call to the proc dynamic at runtime by choosing appropriate if you use sql ddl to define the proc you can specify values for the parameters so the caller can simply omit the ones that are not needed see if you can follow the logic in this procedure integer integer integer from db where col1 is and col2 is and col3 is it may not yield the best execution plan but imo you have to balance optimization against good design principles it runs really quick on my machine	
	
dynamic your executable has a special place for all external calls your executable has a list of libraries it depends two things are it is impossible to say which external function lives in which a program does an external function what actually happens it calls an entry in the plt which does a jump into the dynamic the dynamic loader looks which function was called looks its name symbol table in the and looks up that name in all libraries that are mapped that given executable is dependant once the name is the address of the corresponding function is written back to the so next time the call is made directly bypassing the dynamic answer your you should do the same job as dynamic linker get a list of dependent and lookup all names in this could be done using or for static i think all symbols in given object file within get linked for static library consists of object files and if you need a function and it resides in then will be linked to your app together with function and all other data defined in this is the reason why for example c library functions are split per

easiest way to implement a synchronous method asynchronously is to put it into a and use the and methods on the resulting this will run the synchronous method on a threadpool and will return an so you have to implement the guts of you do need to smuggle a little extra data into the returned by you could do that easily by creating an implementation of that delegates everything to an inner but has an extra field to contain the so that when the instance is passed to you can access the delegate to call on after closer reading of your i see that you need to use an explicit thread with com settings you need to do is properly implement almost everything follows from since the will contain all the bits needed for a very but not terribly implementation of it encapsulates all the essential passing a synchronization callback propagating exceptions from async task and returning myasyncresult object object new manualresetevent new asynccallback exception bool int int public asynccallback object arbitrary public int x get return public void lock never invoke any delegate while holding a if public void lock if public object get return public waithandle get return public bool get return public int lock complex to for memory model lock if throw return public bool get lock return static void myasyncresult ar int x simulate lengthy demo work double catch static iasyncresult asynccallback object thread th new myasyncresult ar new return static int myasyncresult mar return will throw exception if one occurred in background static void demo calling we need state or callback for iasyncresult ar int result important for correctness that client code see the otherwise they might access methods like inappropriately or read the class can be made more efficient by not constructing the implementation in the if not but this is tricky to get the and can and should be disposed of in the as should be done with all objects that implement and should check to make sure that it has gotten an implementation of the right class to get a nicer exception than a cast left these and other details out as they obscure the essential mechanics of the async

elaborate butterworth and have already given the correct is defined by the sdk or the build so it does not use the implementation reserved is defined by the so it uses the underscore to place it in the namespace find a similar set of dual defines with nearly identical names and similar uses such as or maybe think that only the unicode ones get much of any use in their different though sometimes in these cases instead of the underscore version being defined the they are used to control what the crt headers tells the crt headers that crt names which can be either unicode or ansi as should map to the wide character variant does something similar for the sdk win32 apis to their the versions with the underscore are controlled by or used by the compiler the versions without the underscore are by teams outside of the of probably going to be a lot overlap due to compatibility with past versions and just general mistakes by one team or the find it confusing as hell and find that they are used nearly interchangeably in user code when you see one see the other defined in the same because if you need one you need the i think that you should the versions without the underscore writing the and make sure they both get defined via hearers or compiler switches as when defining that the sdk will define when building for the mac because the compiler kind of overstepping not sure what projects use a win32 api an a compiler targeting the mac maybe some version of office for the max or

example the decision whether to use or involve any kind of has a net benefit any there are many similar scenarios and any discussion in these realms are a waste of i believe very important to know what the target compiler is capable of optimizing small code the truth modern compilers are good at jason has an concerning an optimized factorial the other compilers can be surprisingly stupid as the key is that many optimizations require a control flow analysis which becomes np ever optimization thus becomes a between compilation time and the locality of an optimization plays a crucial role because the computation time required to perform the optimization increases just too much when the code size regarded by the compiler increases by just a few as others have these minute details are still relevant and always will be the forseeable although compilers get smarter all the time and machines get so does the size of our data grow in losing this particular in many the amount of data grows much faster than computers get

explanation may not be too academical but this is how i understand it go to university first step involves algebra that proved in the century that any mathematical operation can be expressed using a series of symbols and some associated thus the base 10 arithmetic with the common operators can be expressed in using just two symbols and logic operators or leading to the boolean logic that is the mathematical foundation of digital second step is work that constructed a mathematical model of an imaginary machine that could process the naive description of a turing machine would be any automaton that has memory store operates on a series of symbols that represent state and interprets another series of symbols that define the transition from one state to modern digital processor is an implementation of a turing machine that uses logical algebra as the symbol and operator base a look at a how stuff works explanation of logic at the reason for this is that the logical states can be easily mapped to electrical signals and their associated operators can be implemented in transistor circuits that given a binary input can output the result according to the boolean so any modern computer is a machine that has store state in binary and an array of circuits that accept electrical impulses and operators processor and output results accordingly at a very fast every program written in any computer language is eventually translated by the compiler or runtime into a series of boolean operations for the processor to

fastest solution going to get will probably involve storing your dictionary in a create a queue of triplets where each element in the queue corresponds to a prefix of a word which can be spelled in the ending at location initialize the queue with x elements is the size of your one element for each square in the the algorithm proceeds as the queue is not dequeue a triple for each square with letter c adjacent to if is a output if is a prefix of a insert into the you store your dictionary in a testing if is a word or a prefix of a word can be done in constant time you also keep some extra metadata in each queue such as a pointer to the current node in the so the running time of this algorithm is of words that can be an implementation in python that i just coded def if parent is not dict root for word in curnode for letter in if 97 nextnode if nextnode is nextnode curnode return rows cols queue words for y in for x in c node if node is not while node del for dy in y2 x y if 0 x2 cols and 0 y2 s2 s node2 if node2 is not if return this program output or filter by word length at easy to add but not really relevant to the it also outputs some words multiple times if they can be spelled in multiple if a given word can be spelled in many different ways every letter in the grid is the same and a word like is in your then the running time will get horribly filtering out duplicates and sorting is trivial to due after the algorithm has

few books and articles ever go into detail about why multiple methods are provided to complete a specific task in a specific scenario and what considerations a developer should take when choosing between specific case in point is the simple opening of a text file first section of any io most just say how to open a text streamreader with file tada and end of do at least list the fact that there are multiple classes that allow you to do this discuss that there are even more overloads so you can use each class in several different fewer even try to enter into any discussion about how to select the best method for the task at of course do and these are the ones that usually end up in the top three when someone posts a question about lack of discussion drives me i feel like i should toss a question has the joint purposes out if anyone thinks this is a worthwhile topic in the first people an opportunity to list any interesting articles or books that specifically go into these kinds of made this a wiki because other similar questions were made into and if people feel this question has no i apologize and feel free to vote it am currently reading about binarywriter and the last 20 articles i have hit using google and at least 5 books on safari have shown me how to write a single integer and read it a couple included an example of how to use writestring and exactly one let me know that and use a special encdoding meaning if you do and you get a there are lots of ways to use these why do hardly any articles discuss example of what i mean is when a book or article lists class members and descriptions word for word from msdn without adding any i do not need a list of class members because i can get that from from an i need real world knowledge stuff that will expand me as a not stuff i can look up in five all the member lists and simple examples in the world going to really help anyone who wants to learn their one i reading about stringwriter and same lots of articles and books giving simple some at least say something vague like i may want to use stringwriter if i want to write characters to an underlying how would i know if i want to do what real world scenarios would require i could go on all so i has answers from merhdad and jalf that both explain how you would choose between two methods of generating a random number and demonstrates the kind of information i am talking jalf something along the lines of most cases use option but in this specific case when you are trying to achieve result use option and by the this will have negative effect vs y figured out i can get what i want by searching for x vs y articles based class library many ways to do a specific task what are the top x vs y articles and	
	
few points to consider with multiple tables be necessary to lookup information in all the if yes you will need to search in all tables which is not such simple to the schema changes it is not simple to update the database as all the tables representing the same type of entity would need to information about user edits is also not very simple as it is split in multiple edits consider the scenario documents did the user you considered alternative approaches to storing it is necessary to store each excel row in database as a table storing data as xml and only save idexes on or maybe store only tracking modifications and the document the application can take a part of the database burden and do the

fine to compare iterators which are from the same container as a for loop but this only makes sense if you are moving one or other iterators in either the increment part if the for loop statement or in the body of the for loop in this for loop you compare against but the for loop never changes this means that either there will be no iterations or the for loop will never you probably want to use and not for the and work for all for i iter starts where you want the loop to you may want something like for iter still learning we probably instructive to work through an algorithm like but you should be aware of which probably does what you final need to and i see incrementing iter or it in the outer for loop invalidating the logic in the later for the point in points to one past the end of a so you can use it for loop termination but you try to dereference an iterator which is to

first assumption is your second it depends on whether it is a post back or not if you are binding if it is not the post back and binding happens automatically roughly the value of the controlparameter is retrieved when datasourceview calls select on right before onselecting the sequence for the gridview any given control for that is as from either sqldatasource or is where values get retrieved using almost for each control in a control the framework recursively calls which then triggers retrieval of data and it is a then those parameters will get loaded from a viewstate on the in the order they are this what you were looking assume controlparameter is bound to property c1 of a control i would imagine that on postbacks controlproperty would always be able to get value from no matter of what type c and even if c has viewstate not entirely how it on post back on initial request for that view state is evaluated only to see if it changed so that the onparameterchanged event could get the actual value of the controlparameter is evaluated against the control it points to in your case be when it reads its value is most likely read from a view but at no point does the controlparameter read view state but may i ask if a page is created for the first a value for controlparameter also be retrieved from the moment lstcities retrieves data from data has its value the at that point first time page the lstcities did not retrieve any data the first time a property evaluation happens is on but before any databind happens shortly when gets the crude trying to place it in a life cycle of a subscribes to loadallstate view state gets raisepostbackevents handle your that following sections assume that you did not do any data inside your is where parameters at this point none of them are data bound if it the first there are no the viewstate is empty for the databind you parameters evaluate their control c would be bound at this controlparameter evaluates and thus retrieves value after c has been controlparameter retrieves values whenever it is which in this scenario happens in two onloadcomplete and databind by on the c is not on after the c is both times controlparameter is asked to read maybe following will are classes and methods of interest in a place them in perspective of the page cycle and hopefully it will be class controlparameter public string controlid in public string propertyname in protected override object control control sourcecontrol using return internal void control or read stored value initial load it is object storedvalue the actual value for this parameter from object actualvalue received a change event if if null storedvalue null actualvalue class sqldatasource by private void eventargs simply calls the updatevalue for each class sqldatasourceview private sqldatasource method gets called by databind on protected internal override ienumerable dbconnection connection dbcommand command is where controlparameter will read values this will be already populated by its own sqldatasourceselectingeventargs e new if return data from data or private void parametercollection idictionary exlusions parameter values from for the iordereddictionary values parameters collection using commandparameters and retrieved so controlparameter checks whether its viewstate to the updatevalue method above to see how it uses i assume controlparameter checks whether its viewstate changed only so that it can fire onparameterchanged but why is handling that event so know that it is i like any other it allows you to track changes in properties and act accordingly to your it gets fired in many but i see where anyone subscribes to property evaluation you mean controlparameter checking its own thus you mean controlparameter evaluating which i assume happens after c has been bound means that the gets which checks viewstate for stated then calls which then finds a control and retrieves data using reflection see presume that by update you mean if is called when data binding takes then what that means is that when on next postback is called in and controlparameter will already have same you are forgetting that the view state is loaded on loadallstate and between it and the onloadcomplete there are six more steps page each of those may modify the source you have and did a post the view state for all controls is loaded if stored value in the view it will load on you decide to set here may decide to store in its view state or not then other events next comes since sqldatasource subscribes to this it will evaluate all associated parameters since you did change but view state did null storedvalue null actualvalue return true and onparameterchanged will be by the there is at least ten other places where this event gets it play big role in data binding and property retrieval	
	
first bit of advice would if you ever find yourself saying using can create a then you should immediately start looking for a get out of the procedural mindset when using are still a few fuzzy parts to your does a call count as being during a minute period if it simply has any portion of the call during that for if a call starts at 1923 and lasts 62 seconds is it considered to overlap with all calls starting at going to assume yes on that but you can adjust the code below if not it should be a minor the breakdown to minutes i would usually use a table with time spans a start time and end time for each of the slices in which in your case since you are dealing with exact minutes and your start times are in minutes if the data type is screwed just going to use a single column with the exact minute in set up that table int not constraint primary key clustered insert into values 100 set if set set we can select for the outer join r between as as as carryover to as 60 need to either use that as a subquery to get the averages over a given since late on friday leave that step up to you one last i account for time spans that cross day boundaries go past hopefully the code points you in the right direction for a better approach might be to create a view that turns all of those nasty strings into actual datetime then this becomes really trivial with the minutes

first guess would be differences between in vista and if you are using a cframewnd there is a gripper control in what would be your last pane in the far right of the status it looks as though changes in the may account for giving you a smaller i assume you are just seeing a smaller than you did you are not talking about smaller x and y at the same time are you have you may want to look for the correct version and deploy it with your or make your manifest reflect which version to i have a clear cut but themes are the only thing that come to since if i recall in the gripper was added on top of the status or the status bar was shrunk just enough to display suggestion you could use would be to detect your running version of and made the assumption of the gripper for the the gripper will be the same size as the vscroll so you can naturally remove that many from the last cell at and render text based on have to go home and fire up and see how it acts based on what you are saying have a vista vm handy to see what version of it has installed by but my guess they put some code in it to deal with the you have complete sample that would really make things easier on me i have to start digging for all my old vc6 generated code and go from interesting test would be to call getsystemmetrics on the pieces that we think could have an effect on and see how they differ from system to if you put vista into do you still see the same which machine is your dev vista or

fix is only applicable to rails as giles mentions they fixed this in internally using much the same but beware the json earlier attempt at rails if required explicitly will break everything all over you mean the statement itself raises that or do you mean when you call you get the the latter is what i would if you have a problem requiring the json gem then not sure going just ran into this problem with the oauth in my there is not a true because the oauth gem depend on therefore the problem is that json is clobbering the activesupport i solved this by simply requiring json before activesupport is the did the trick putting it after the block did allows activesupport to clobber the default json implementation if you are using a gem that actually depends on the json implementation of then you are up a this is definitely the worst of and i would advocate for the rails and json gem developers to resolve the though it will be painful because one or the other will have to break backwards the short gem authors may be able to bridge the gap by supporting both this is more or less feasible depending on how the gem uses the a worst case scenario is an official fork and

following comment on my regex solution incite my to perform a this a situation where regex is a little overly a straight solution would be simpler and more i response was the i decided for regex because you get all cases covered your regex is if you do it with and get a simpler solution if the input is but catching all invalid using string methods might really become when i start parsing a number decimal i already know that it is a valid number and will not think of inputs like you will split them but crash quite sure or return a meaningless in code accessing will out of bounds for the input parsing may and there are sure a few more uncatched catching them all will probably the code more unreadable than the regex i decided to use microsofts awesome tool and analyse my regex approach and string opertion i left code unmodified and replaced the console output in my solution with statements that build the result as just like david make a quite complete analysis i constraint pex to generate only inputs shorter than 45 characters and use only the following 9 different is no need to use all because they behave all the i included 9 to make it easy to discover the overflow but 0 and 1 schould also be sufficent pex would probaly find 1000 instead of i included 0 and 1 to discover an error with very tiny numbers like but nothing i assume very small numbers are silently rounded to zero but i did not investigate this or may be 44 because of the precision of decimal of 28 to 29 digits plus some room for other characters were just to short to generate a small enough the other characters are because they are the other valid characters in the finally i included the exclamation mark as surrogate for invalid result of the analysis proved me pex found two bugs in my i do not check for null input skipped that intentionaly to concentrate on the important causing the well known nullreferenceexception and pex discovered that the input causes to fail with an also reports some false negative for example was reported as an input causing a reruning the generated test yields no it turns out that caused the test to fail during looking at other failed tests reveals that fails for inputs starting with a decimal point during the but they are valid numbers and do not fail during normal i am unable to explain this false here is the result for one run of pex against the string operation both implementation share the missing null check and the overflow but the simple string operation solution is unable to handle many malformed they almost all result in a but pex discovered also the indexoutofrangeexception i question is how hard would it be to handle all this the simple solution would be to guard the parsing instruction with i am not sure if this is sufficent to guarantee correct operation on the well formed part of the but may this is not required and a malformed input should cause an empty what would make it to fix the here are the code coverage results that i analysed the regex solution using decimal and single because pex was unable to instrument one method used inside for me a regex solution should really be they are somewhat harder to design and but they handle malformed inputs much robuster than a simple string operation based and just not to forget i did not checke if the results returned are at this is another

format specifier is in the system which seems to always be macroman and not so it can only display characters in macroman your best option with nslog is just to use the native object format specifier and pass the nsstring directly instead of converting it to a c if you only have a c string and you want to use nslog to display a message instead of printf or you will have to do something like don suggests in order to convert the string to an nsstring object all of these should display the expected char you do decide to use note that while it accepts strings in utf8 format and passes the correct encoding to the syslog daemon it will show up properly in the it encodes the string for visual encoding when displaying to the terminal or logging to a file so values will be displayed as escaped character

function does not cause the current thread to yield and does not release the all it does is restart one thread that has suspended itself on the condition via this just means the awakened thread is available for it cause it to execute the will schedule it sometime in the just because the has been awakened and is contending for the that mean going to get the mutex mutexes are not necessarily fair to all threads that have requested according to the man locks the given if the mutex is currently it becomes locked and owned by the calling and returns so the can spin in its loop several happily unlocking and relocking the mutex several times before being swapped out by the this means the will only get a chance at the mutex if the scheduler happens to interrupt the during the brief time in which it has released the achieve the output you both threads will need to control their execution with a condition and signal each other before suspending this may or may not be what you actually want to do with your real it really matter what order you created the threads creating a thread does not yield the creating so the main thread will probably create both threads before either gets and the thread scheduler is free to schedule either one of them for execution if the does run first on your that just happens to be the implementation behavior on your platform and is not something that should be relied

function timotei posted will give you the length of the string as long as the part of the string you are interested in only contains if you are assigning the values in the program should be true as fortran is supposed to initialize the variables to be empty and for characters that means a if you are reading in from a file you might pick up other control characters at the end of the lines carriage return line feed depending on your you should also toss those out in the function to get the correct string otherwise you could get some funny print statements as those characters are printed as is my version of the function that checks for alternate white space characters at the end besides function integer character i do while i i strlen there are other characters in the section this still work that it does work for your you can then change your write statement to look like it will print out just the actual to whether or not you should use another array to hold the lengths of the that is up to the function is whereas looking up the length in a table is if you find yourself computing the lengths of these static strings it may improve performance to compute the length once when they are read store them in an array and look them up if you need if you notice the i worry about

glad you was thinking of asking a question like does cpan have to suck so but decided it worth sacrificing my reputation when i already know the and since this question is marked thank you for not moderating me down for giving my personal take on this even if you think i am mistaken or some i did quite a lot of perl coding in the and enjoyed but eventually concluded that the language lacked a lot features that were needed for i became a developer for several and now am now a very technical project i still use perl for scripts and data crunching and other bits and and have recently started using perl scripts to test the web services our coders have i came to for the but stayed for the pleased to see the language has grown up and has all sorts of fantastic like moose and mvc and templates and so and would like to be using and i but it is taking and i only have a few hours now and then to work with why it to answer the the obvious most perl programs need cpan more than one way to do i need modules to do a lot of things that i would use modules for if it was easy to do for i have been parsing xml documents with and regular i know wrong the first step to recovery is admitting you have a but i can copy and paste the code to do this in a few or i could go away and try and make cpan work for another month or lets get a little more cpan is earlier this year i tried to use cpan to install moose because i had read great things about it and was keen to do proper oo programming in perl and for it not to be so i followed the install and pressed hundreds of time before getting dumped on with pages and pages of compiler warnings in the final what the hell do i do my main dev box has some sort of moose module just waiting am to bite me in the ass when i least expect that was about two months and i have not been i speculate that lots of have dependencies on other programming languages and that makes it more brittle opposed to languages whose libraries are coded in the same i further speculate that experiences like this scare potential users for cpan beginners is where is the authoritative cpan documentation the introduction and tutorials for and how was i supposed to know i have been reading cpan documentation on and off for a few and am starting to figure out where things see that almost all individual perl modules on cpan are beautifully documented but it took me a long time to find that install process is too four steps and hundreds of prompts may have been okay ten years ago when there were fewer packages and fewer but now it is just why i just type something like in my shell and have it be this is particularly given that advanced users often claim portability is a citing things like packages and par that i still and why is installing locally even harder when so many people seem to want to do are vexing like whether i should install cpan modules with cpan or with the package management where advice is more there is more than one way to do and when you start doing advanced you have to make decisions about how to install modules and what modules to use and where do you remember a beginner and the documentation is kind of fragmented and the learning curve is my solution has been to try and work around this by not using cpan while i read a little advanced perl has a very steep learning advanced perl users apparently do not remember this and cannot see imo there is a world of difference between using perl as it was originally conceived as a practical extraction and reporting language with powerful regular expressions and using it as a modern development platform with oo and templates and mvc and all sorts of other i have yet to find a incremental path from casual perl use to advanced perl there you apologies for the d

going to add some words of advice about using a trigger for it is possible to do this with a unlike i think it should be a database issue because all records will need the uniqueness not just ones added through a specific putting logic like this in the application is a bad idea from the standpoint of data ata minumum make sure the filed has a unique most inexperienced trigger developers think that triggers work on each row individually and do not design their trigger to handle multiple row you may think that there are no multiple row you would most of the time be at some point you are going to want to import a group of the trigger must be able to handle using your it can handle only one record at a this is a huge flaw because the only way to handle it in a trigger is through the use of a cursor or while this is extremely slow and could end up locking up your customer table for hours if you have the need to add a lot of customers all at think idea of creating a pool of possible unique passwords is a good one because then you can use logic in the trigger to fill it but to work it you would need three columns identity field to use for grabbing the next 300 rows for you should also schedule a nightly job to generate more potential passwords if the number unused is below a certain that way things will never fail because you unexpectedly ran out of potential

good example comes from order an order from a customer typically has an order number that identifies the some data that occurs once per order such as the order date and the customer and a series of line each line item contains an item number that identifies a line item within an a product the quantity of that the price of the and the amount for the line which could be computed by multiplying the quantity by the number that identifies a line item only identifies it in the context of a single the first line item in every order is item number the complete identity of a line item is the item number together with the order number of which it is a parent child relationship between orders and line items is therefore an identifying a closely related concept in er modeling goes by the name where line item is a subentity of a subentity has a mandatory identitying relationship to the entity that subordinate classical database the primary key of the lineitems table would be some of designers would give an item a separate that serves as a primary and is autoincremented by the i recommend classical design in this

good i should be more explicit in the definitive about the and serve two different purposes in a refers to the process of installing an artifact in your local refers to the process of deploying an artifact to a remote i run a large project on a my going to usually run this is going to install all of the generated binary software artifacts in my local then when i build individual modules in the maven is going to retrieve the dependencies from the local it comes time to deploy snapshots or going to run running this is going to attempt to deploy the files to a remote repository or usually going to be deploying to a repository manager such as is true that running is going to require some extra you are going to have to supply a distributionmanagement section in your	
	
good i think i have seen them more often than not it is an effort to fix performance problems by someone that is too darn lazy to troubleshoot their way down to the cause of those performance problems or even researching whether there actually is a performance in many of these cases i wonder if it just a case of that person wanting to try a particular technology and desperately looking for a nail that fits their shiny new a recent architect comes to me with an elaborate proposal to vertically partition a key table in a fairly large and complex he wants to know what type of development effort would be necessary to adjust for the the conversation went like why are you considering what is the problem you are trying to table x is too we are partitioning it for performance what makes you think it is too the consultant said that is way too many columns to have in one and this is affecting users have reported intermittent slowdowns in the xyz module of the how do you know the width of the table is the source of the that is the key table used by the xyz and it is like 200 it must be the but module xyz in particular uses most of the columns in that and the columns it uses are unpredictable because the user configures the app to show the data they want to display from that it is likely that of the time wind up joining all the tables back together anyway which would the consultant said it is too wide and we need to change who is this i know we hired a nor did they talk to the development team at we hired them this is part of a proposal they but they insisted we needed to this uh so the consultant who sells database services thinks we need a database conversation went on and on like i took another look at the table in question and determined that it probably could be narrowed with some simple normalization with no need for exotic partitioning of course turned out to be a moot point once i investigated the performance problems and tracked them down to two indexes on a few few rogue data analysts who were key the querying database directly course the architect is still pushing for a vertical partitioning of the table hanging on to the he even bolstered his case by getting a proposal from another database consultant who was able to determine we needed major design changes to the database without looking at the app or running any performance

got a number of reference counted classes in some of my and also in dlls those applications all inheriting from and implementing a irefcounted order to help with finding the source of these memory leaks i want each application to maintain a list of all these refrence counted classes in problem is the managing of instances of these lists such that their useage does not effect the usage of my classes i need to pass a pointer to a list around all the instead somehow attaching it to the a good chance several of these applications may be running at and using the same each application needs its own object and all the dlls etc loaded by that application need to use that list rember that one dll may be loaded by multiple list must be destroyed after every other global and static variable in so the objects left in the list when its destructed are ones that truley were not correctly then will simply add a breakpoint to the destructor so i can look through any unallocated objects in the debugging memory leaks in reference counting

got a which is basically the queue in the which takes an queue item off the which is an action execution block off the queue and then calls a method to execute the actionlist within the queue can kill the queue easily enough by enqueing a null actionblock and block the main thread by doing a with a until the queue count goes to and all the threads fall through the while thereby but the method executing the last actionlist may still be executing the last is their anyway to detect if that method still has a thread executing like maybe using a semaphore or counter with an interlock to count the semaphore up at the beginning of the method and count it down at the so if it reaches them i know its not is the implementing a destroy method on the to close it down before calling to detect if a threaded method has

got the idea of column families right basically just a hint to hbase to store and replicate these items together for faster you put two column families in the same table and always have different keys to access then really the same thing as having them in two separate you only gain by having two column families in the same table that are accessed via the same if i have columns for the total number of pageviews for a given web the number of unique views for the same the browser the user uses to view the and their internet i can decide that i want the first two to be a column family and the last two to be another column here all four are accessed by the same namely the web site in so gaining by having them in the same in different tables i would end up having to do a operation on the two i really know the numbers though so i really tell you how slow the operation is i recall hbase having a join since and what the tipping point is where splitting them into separate tables outweighs having them in the same table vice this all depends on the data trying to so if you would never need to join across the you would want to keep them in separate tables since you could argue not that related to each other in the first

guess that converter is only being called once because selecteditems on a list box is not a dependencyproperty will not notify the binding that it has may be better off doing this conversion in your on which methodology you and exposing a property for the second list box to bind can do this in one of two ways that i can think you can listen to on the first list and update the property that the second list is bound you can put an property on the items that the first list is bound to and update your second list when that changes on any given you can add this style for listboxitem to sync the property between the data item and the guess is that the first one will be less difficult to though it may not fully mesh with whatever ui methodology	
	
guess that this error is actually coming from the stored procedure calling whatever using for in the proc is the it sounds like instead of doing something like doing a and complaining that it convert one of the values of cityname to an integer to compare it with used incompatible types on purpose just to get my point across which is does runtime even bother to try to convert a value from one incompatible type to since the fact that user assigned string to variable of type suggests that it is most likely a bug and not something user did

had a similar compiler that implemented a bizarre version of the we had which would call constructors for us and destructors were called most the vendor went and implemented and using and as a to the the problem was that they never mentioned that a would not cause destructors of local objects to be our group inherited the code base after someone wrote an application acting like it was standard using raii techniques and all of the other we ended up rewriting it in what a number of us call you might want to consider just biting the bullet and writing in straight instead of have an explicitly called initialization destructors become an explicitly called termination there much of that you mimic in c pretty mi is a pain in the but single inheritance is pretty take a look at for some it almost describes the approach that we i really wish i had written our method down	
	
had a similar design issue writing an asynchronous socket listener for formatted translation of what i came up with into the serialport datareceived model would be something like main class encapsulates the system it will contain the logic for generating the response based on each instance of the class will be bound to a single serial port that can be set during or after there will be a startcommunications type method it will wire up the datareceived event to another method in the this method is responsible for grabbing the data from the and determining if a full message has if it raises its own event on the which will have an appropriate method wired to you could also have it call a predefined method on your class instead of raising an event i defined an event to improve basic design is working just fine in a production and can handle more input than the rest of the systems connected to it	
	
had a similar problem a while and did not find any easy way to do this using an import the way i resolved the import this was a and not something that was going to hang was to create a simple macro from excel that would simply call a stored using each row as the stored proc would intelligently insert each parameter and then grab the id to use as the foreign key on the next parameter declare declare check that the category if not exists from tblcategories where categoryname your insert statement then grab the set set the category id vba macro had code similar sub dim cnt as dim wbbook as dim wssheet as dim intactiverow as dim intinsuranceproduct as get our set cnt read the input set wbbook set wssheet ignore the header intactiverow process every row into the do while execute the stored generatescript would create your increment i for row intactiverow intactiverow end set cnt set wbbook set wssheet

had the same a vm would but it slows my 1 gb laptop down to a so i ended up having to upgrade to 2 gb memory and install i enjoy this a lot but since that is not an option here is what i came personally i like this if you have a windows xp disc lying around this option is especially if you have virtualization options on your though i like this one it is an i had windows 7 installed because it ran better than vista and xp but it gave me internet explorer i tried and it only let me preview internet explorer maybe it was too early a beta or because i had a beta either i dont like this one just by far a great great works perfectly in xp and internet explorer 6 and 7 work right with it in windows but if you have vista this is the way to multiple internet explorers work right under vista but this as stated this does not work in but it is an option for any windows xp user out there have been known issues with this causing your os to actually become more but i know for a fact if i just heard some reports about explorer 7 standalone though not applicable for this question others may find it useful to know that there is a standalone internet explorer on my vm i have internet explorer 6 installed by default and internet explorer 7 as i would not recommend this as standalone internet explorer 7 is not multipleies genuine internet explorer 7 or ietester is much better browser shots is a great tool but somewhat basically it takes a screenshot on literally hundreds of browsers and lets you view the thing is it is mighty and you get a full screen a great meer i heard about something from adobe labs called meer meer a while but i was never able to actually find i believe actually takes you to adobe website but it looks like a great tool complete with onion skin overlay and the like super preview but on the web instead of if it is definitely would check this one i say ietester is a great anyone running windows 7 however is left in the i tried every option out there and none of them worked for me except for linux host and virtualbox xp my

handmade jvm would be a great way to learn about virtual machines in the issues of program language design the jvm and the nitty gritty of parsing and so you choose to take it in that you could also explore which is where it can get and you can take research papers and implement their being if less interested in the long and arduous task of creating a vm from you might want to modify an existing open source vm like it will show you what a virtual machine but not necessarily how java code works in is a clean room implementation of the java virtual plus the associated class libraries needed to provide a java runtime you could study the but dive in to implementing more interesting

hard to say without being able to see your suspect you are running into robustness issues with your floating point have you considered using integer points or doing some kind of robustness enhancement like eliminating common bits in the floating point is an open source geometry library called geos which might be useful to test your data set out there are also algorithms in geos to perform snap rounding to an integer grid and eliminate common bits to help you determine if you are encountering a robustness of further note is how geos computes the intersection using duality in homogenous space i quite tell if the dot product projection technique you describe is mathmatically equivalant an my favorite solution to compute intersections in a graph of edges is to use a sweepline in conjunction with a monotone chain of when you use monotone you can eliminate a lot of edge intersection since chains never intersect this is what geos

have a design conundrum that i could use some feedback so hoping my fellow sharepoint experts can help me work this am managing a set of projects in a single moss list where the column will be treated as a least in my for related each project will have associated with it a set of defined deliverables to 37 separate activities throughout each and each deliverable will track one significant activity that is recommended to complete during the initial thinking was to define the 37 deliverables in a separate so that each deliverable had not just a but linking to a separate where the user can find more info on how to accomplish the to give a quick explanation of what the deliverable means having to send the user off to a separate server to get any to help us filter and sort the deliverables into the order in which required to be to identify the primary project role that owns completion of the i would create individual items in another list each of which was associated with the project and the item in the lookup so that we could track additional these date when deliverable was finished a from which the user can choose states such as or in text to record more on what was done and one major problem with this approach is that best practices guidance strongly discourages moss lists with 2000 items in the even if we never added more deliverables to each afraid that scale beyond 54 projects how many in very short creating multiple instances of list3 is theoretically but strikes me as a nightmare to automate my set of tracked projects first alternative i can think of is to 37 additional columns in the projects plus the x columns needed to enable the and fields that the users will need to track for each plus having to manage a brittle of each of the spd forms web part pages that like to use to the ui for all this data entry data alternative someone suggested to me is to create for each and list the deliverables in a single list in the seems awfully heavyweight to and considering this only as my last would any of you pull this off in moss relying on an outside or any code that would have to be installed to the is there some trick to making this that obvious from the usual moss list is there some hidden feature of moss i should some neat aspect of sharepoint designer i discovered i to believe that many others have faced this same and have figured out way to make it appreciate any ideas you folks can suggest thanks in which would you choose additional or a separate linked

have a on a webpage which ends up with a calculated height property of this is not set in any cascading style inline or nor is it set in a i have searched everywhere in my code but the number 633 does not show up i can solve this by setting which is the height that i but ie seems to override this to the 633px that i would get in other browsers too by i have verified in both google chrome and that the actual contents of the div are nowhere near 633 pixels is there any way i can find out what the reason is for this calculated for here is what google chrome reports as the style properties of the style crossed in div in questions contains two one with one line of text in and a div with a height of so i figured out causing the second div that the main div contains one and a div floating over the right of that using internet explorer keeps the space where this element would have been any way around i wrapped the contents of the floating div with in a second div with that gets rid of the whitespace under the main image final html looks something like some floating out what the cause is of a certain calculated css

have a path made up of a list of 2d i want to turn these into a strip of triangles in order to render a textured line with a specified thickness other such so essentially the list of 2d points need to become a list of vertices specifying the outline of a polygon that if rendered would render the the problem is handling the corner caps the resulting polygon needs to be in the sense of no clean so that it could feasibly be extruded or otherwise toyed there any resources around that can provide algorithm code or any more information on doing this absolutely do not want a full fledged 2d vector library with dashes and all the bells and been digging in multiple source trees for openvg implementations and other things to find some but all terribly definitely willing to code it but there are many degenerate cases segments thick widths sharp that create all kinds of join even a little help would save me hours of trying to deal with them an example of one of those degenerate cases that causes ugliness if you were simply to go from vertex to red is the original the orange blocks are rectangles drawn at a specified width aligned and centered on each do i render thick 2d lines as

have a problem with i think i understand what the issue but i test that understanding and ask if anyone has seen this before or can workaround or an alternate please bear with this is a which is difficult to break down to a minimal test writing a interface to a legacy messaging i have the interop assembly for a direct interface and that all works of it is that i have a class for each message and a generic passing around that just occupies the same space as a maximal size message class implements cast operators to cast into and out of called the generic class and the individual are both derived from a bodyless minimal message a client to send a message just calls a send method in an interface assembly a casting into the generic type for the receiver event the receiving app a generic which be cast according to a common which has a relationship with the message have implemented the local direct interface and this all works i can now message between the test application and existing native the basic class structure looks like class a message class generic message defines an empty class some irrelevant cast operators to convert to and from the abstract message public static implicit operator some irrelevant public static implicit operator some irrelevant the cast comes the i want to extend this interface to support group of developers overseas can communicate via wcf with an service i have this is with an admirable lack the the exposes for test purposes method which takes a string and converts this into a message legacy this also works with a call to the function in my application being converted into a legacy message and sent to i tried to extend the interface to add an entrypoint which would accept a in the hope that this would work the same way as the direct the sender would cast their message into a sending function with this and the adapter would simply pass generic message into its local interface assembly for so the wcf code would look pretty much exactly like the normal messaging interface void dialout void dispatch i extended the client and the proxy code for the wcf client the client seems that the client app cannot understand the cast and throws a even if i include the messaging assembly with the code above a the client code the type defined in the generated and ignores the original message so it cannot the cast this is the type in with the imported type in using the type defined in far as i can the class defined in the generated proxy is of course the generated proxy class only defines data not contains two partial class whole slew of data partial class extra stuff to define the added can leave the assembly reference so the code see the cast and fails or i can leave the reference in and the compiler wilfully ignores type definition and uses the proxy and fails to other wcf developers seen this kind of thing or does everyone simple value parameters when calling wcf am i just going to have to an endpoint with a unique class parameter for every kind of message want to this is a maintenance type

have a simple form with a few required field validators and a validation summary when i submit the the validation will cause the form to jump to the top of the if i remove the validation the page does not a quick example the line tried setting in the required field validator and for giggles even though this a postback without any is there a known solution for this found the problem in the js generated by seems to come down to a single line in the ideas on how to remove or bypass work around for the time for all validation controls client in page hoping for a client side seems a better work around is to just override the function so that it does nothing when called by the validation the above anywhere on the page leaves the client validation in but disables the method throughout the validation summary causes page to jump to

have a site an application that creates mail merges or based on a couple of user it can generate cartesian joins worth of data without a but in comes the needs of enterprise to make life a bit more have to build the application so after verifying zip codes of remote it creates emails to media targets based on how far from that employee the media target say for instance employees are well known volunteers where they the enterprise wants to email media within a 5 mile radius of these employees a message about the work the employee is this is where things get i have several choices which i will outline the attempts and the largest radius is 20 i create a database table that holds records of every zip code in the joined to every zip code within 20 miles of that zip the dataset looks something like names are different this is for the sake of as an ny has 350k records from the above dataset other states are average load time on that 6 not i verified this by setting it is during the stage that the disconnect one was never implemented due to a logistics i make a database connection for each employee zip to media target zips with a distance of x or except that the source files and the media targets combined can reach upwards of 34k individualized 34k db even if i could devise a way to reuse zip code i did some test checks in the db and found that there are 500 distinct zip codes in ny where employees 500 db i doubt that would work but i could be latest scheme to get around the problem is in that hoping the web server runs a better game then the dataset object by getting a new dataset looks doing a distance formula to figure out if the data this relies heavily on the processors on the web is this a worthwhile or will i find the same load time damage on this attempt as there a better appreciate any even if it confirms my fears that this project might not i have control of the and running sql2k programming the site in visual studio framework might get upgraded to sql2005 and vs2008 within the next few months dataset to long load time

have an online game where i record lots of gameplay these stats tables get large very and i have to be careful because simply recording more stats can cause the performance to get pretty once the table gets big which a very good is to keep the stats tables i have an automatic process that creates a new table every 24 preventing the performance from getting too but my solution is ugly and is a sort of of stats i use innodb and have set up a couple of indexes to improve and then i just keep 30 of these tables around one is 24 so saving a month of every 24 my automated process deletes the then renames all the numbered tables to have a higher and then it creates a blank table called simply this is the where stats are actively being recorded tables basically record every transaction between every player and every other player in the game that they interact thus an exponential explosion of when a new transaction it checks to see if there is already a row for the transactions between these two players during that if there it updates the row with changes to their it creates a new a pair of players who interact 1000 times in a day and a pair who interact just a single time will both have just a single row in the table for that each action on the database involves a select and then either an update or an so it is pretty even between reads and writes as currently the reading of data in a larger for analysis of stats and multiple players is done very relative to the single updates and there are about rows created per know this could be i easily reduce the amount of data but concerned about and i could increase performance even more by having a new table created every 4 for but then i have to mess with 180 i could make it simpler by just using one and then everything comes to a screeching that i do need to update rows in these so i use something like the archive storage but i only need to insert or update on the stats is also the minor issue that when the daily rotation process any queries coming in at that moment may be it is in the process of renaming all tables and creating a new new entries may losing a few inserts is not a big but a solution where this error or could be done would be for any ideas that might idea for of

have at least these five options for modeling the type hierarchy you table one table for all product with enough columns to store all attributes of all this means of most of which are null on any given table one table for storing attributes common to all product then one table per product storing attributes specific to that product table no table for common products one table per product storing both common product and one table for storing attributes common to all product one extra column stores a blob of in or some other this blob allows you to store the attributes specific to each product you can use fancy design patterns to describe such as facade and but regardless you have a blob of attributes that be easily queried within you have to fetch the whole blob back to the application and sort it out one table for and one table that pivots attributes to instead of eav is not a valid design with respect to the relational but many people use it this is the mentioned by another see other questions with the on stackoverflow for some of the thoughts about although many people seem to favor i it seems like the most flexible and therefore the keep in mind the adage here are some of the disadvantages of way to make a column mandatory of way to use sql data types to validate way to ensure that attribute names are spelled way to put a foreign key on the values of any given for a lookup results in a conventional tabular layout is complex and because to get attributes from multiple rows you need to do for each degree of flexibility eav gives you requires sacrifices in other probably making your code as complex than it would have been to solve the original problem in a more conventional in most an unnecessary to have that degree of in the question about product much simpler to create a table per product type for so you have some consistent structure enforced at least for entries of the same product use eav only if must be permitted to potentially have a distinct set of when you have a finite set of product eav is class table inheritance would be my first

have either contributed to or implemented coding practices for sql server in several you can spend days researching what others have done but and you can probably use pieces but i find each environment to be completely a high would suggest separating function from form as much as what do i there are some best practices that can be tested and documented to your specific environment and application such as when to use temp tables over large no dynamic sql query these can totally vary depending on hardware and then there are other standards that are more opinion naming use of version the latter group can get pretty political really it is also a good idea to start small implement a little at a outside vendors i have found it impractical to influence until there is a performance impact explicit query hints that cause huge table then it is most effective to provide data and get them to patch if there is some sort of service contract i see how you can enforce note that they may be writing for multiple versions platforms and want the code as flexible as

have plenty of answers that explain well how to do but for the sake of completion repeat and add to is only ever useful for interactive use you know all your filenames are plain no spaces or or when used with the break is a very useful put using it to pipe filenames into with is rather convoluted as can do it all itself with either command or command depending on what you somecommand somecommand former runs with for each file recursively in that matches latter runs with many arguments as fit on the command at once for files recursively in that match one to use depends on if it can take multiple filename arguments then the latter option is faster you run far less if takes only one argument then you need the former so look at man on is a statement that iterates over if you do something like foo in giving argument to iterate over the if you do something like foo in asking to take the contents of and tear it apart wherever there are tabs or newlines whatever characters are in and use the pieces of that operation as arguments to is not assuming that the result of a tearing long string that contains filenames apart wherever there is whitespace yields in a pile of filenames is just as you have just answer use obviously the wrong the above commands all assume that is an executable in if a need this construct instead over like you but read somebashstatement uses a loop that reads parts of the string outputs until it reaches a byte is what uses to separate the since bytes be part of filenames tabs and this is a safe you need to be part of your script it change the script environment by keeping a counter or setting a variable or some then you can still use to run your bash bash do somebashstatement the executes a command with three or more bash statement to will put this in you can put anything you like filename or filenames on whether you used or the up in if more than of statement in the first command here runs with the filename as statement in the second command here runs a loop that iterates over each positional parameter what the reduced syntax and runs a with the filename as the difference here between the very first statement i showed with is that we run only one process for lots of filenames but still one for of those this is also well explained in the page linked

have recently begin creating an image editing tool which will cater to a very specific this is as much for the people who are going to use it as it is for my own i have hit a bit of an architectural snag early any image the user will use to draw on and manipulate an my first attempt at this consisted of a simple interface void graphics g other would be nice and clean and would allow for easy maintenance and just add the interface objects in and call the draweffect method of the selected one at problem with this approach is that different drawing tools do not cleanly adhere to a single for a pen tool need only know the point to draw at in order to the rectangle however needs the first point as well as the current the polygon tool needs to keep track of multiple mouse am having trouble thinking of a nice way to implement the best method that i can think of now would involve a switch statement and a case for each which would mean that the drawing logic would be in the canvas not encapsulated by tool type because this is i would like to do this the right thanks for any help in level design pattern for image editing

have seen two solutions to this kind of the first is to try to use characteristics to define subordinate products to the the challenge here is that in addition to your thoughts for in most cases the product will evolve with new manufacturers that bring new aspects to the for one manufacturer may make a cheaper but have a different application method for the logo or stitching that may be significant enough to think that carrying a non significant product number for each product and then attaching the characteristics as attributes works out the it is easily searched and if a group of products are strongly a productgroup that the individual products attach to works advantages here are that you can easily query for specific attributes are in that more can be added old ones if you started with but then added another to the color you can change them to and can control price and inventory are at the detail product level more tables may be required to account for all assumes that your characteristics are universally if they are your characteristic subtable approach can work by creating a join table between characteristics and the product detail tables and populate as this will require more business logic ensure each product category gets characteristics this latter case i would use products in the base product table qty and cost of that i would clone the characteristics from and then adjust as each new product is as you move when a new variation having a this function that allows you to just adjust the from the base product would be as far as managing the inventory and this is going to happen at the ui being able to generate queries for related products and manage all the pricing for related products will go a long way to making this	
	
have several applications that i wish to deploy using some of the files in my application deployments override files from other deployed simply including the new files in the deployment package will cause rpm am looking for the proper way to use rpm to already installed have already come up with a few solutions but nothing seems quite custom versions of the rpms containing the original seems like a large amount of work for a relatively small reward even though it feels less like a hack than some of the other possible the files in the rpm with another name and copy them over in the post would work but will mean littering the system with multiple copies of the also it means additional maintenance in the rpm build spec for each wget in the post section to replace the original files from some known is similar to the copy technique but the files even live in the this might act like a nice central configuration authority the files as new then use symlinks to override the is also similar to the copy technique but with less the problem here is that some files behave well as do i use rpm to existing

have two processes which exange messages each a is a normal program which sends messages to process b is a qt gui application showing received messages into a text created a customized widget which inherits from qplaintextedit and reads messages from a pipe when a timer and appends them in the text is not really designed like this would be pretty bad design i but just to make things simple reasons i process a cannot be shut down while creating the form using is that while using qt designer selecting the showmessages widget and putting it within the the widget begins to show even if in the this feature is cool but the problem is that when i save the already present messages are saved in which results in turn in bad behaviour when i start process b process starts showing messages i received during the creation could clean the text box just after process b but i think that avoiding messages to be present in the file is much what i want is to be able to write code like this for the not in the timer there an qt function to know if in the do you think that distinguishing between designer and runtime code is for but english is not my primary between designer and runtime

having some trouble with understanding how iis is handling static variables on its my understanding has always been that if iis has 4 worker processes that it can handle 4 requests simultaneously and that it would be the same as having 4 separate threads running the any static variables would persist in each individual the reason a bit confused is that i have a scope that made which manages connections and caching when testing the app i notice any issues but after compiled it and hit it at the same time from two different locations i seem to get a sort of now if these worker processes are separate why would this can more than one request be processed on a single worker thread at the same this is tremendously important as there are unique that are held in these static members to handle escalation of the objects that manage these functions and it appears that they are trying to access the same running this on iis server on an x64 values that need to persist through the thread on a single i put these values into which seems to do the can be used but it may not be available during the entirity of the request in one module that i is only used on a variable to indicate if that thread has already loaded the settings for the cahcing if true then the tread is ready to fetch data from the caching do i prevent static member variables from being accessed by more than one request at a time in

hinges here on the agreed upon definition of hack hack coder hacker cracker script kiddie jedi cyberpunk ninja code monkey reverse engineer criminal mischevious person felon convicted felon suspected felon mastermind chaotic good characters chaotic evil doers dictators emperor insurgent terrorist agents neo copyright violators copy writers spammers marketers telemarketers spyware creators computer virus for programmers necessarily have done hacking in the rebelled against the but were though not technically law great programmers certainly associate themselves as being a hacker in the romantic cyberpunk sense of the however being a hacker does not imply a lack of morals or hackers may find that their conscience does not prohibit them from executing technological deeds that the general societal concensus may deem as questionable at best or worse reprehensible or worst literally flat out free will does of engineers and crackers are usually better than your average hacker at i would never hire anyone who at least know how to do some reverse it is necessarily a part of being a good from my then i consider myself a fairly veteran and have seen an abnormally high number of instances that completely justify reverse engineering for corporate gain the avoidance of corporate have never had a problem not doing things that i know i if i wanted free time is a good instant reward for moderate amounts of who wants to go out of way to break come i have never identified what makes a criminal organization except for the profit depends on what you consider what you what you all hackers are in the vast majority are intent on remaining a hardened criminal is probably not going to be someone you want to but it depends on your first of you may not even have the choice to hire a convicted felon depending on your industry or for your are you in again if you are dealing specifically with security and and it is virtually a requirement that you truly are smart as a and that you have the salt to outsmart foxes should you be given a chance to accept such a masterminds would never get if they ever got they would have lost their prior status as a masterminds could be criminals but not and probably need to be hired by you for your measly some good masterminds probably are out i know do want those you want the you want you want you want vast gobs and gobs of you want people who can fix any problem and are undeterred by you want people who know that anything truly is just intelligent systems of logic consider all so never going to find smart people to work for you who have not even considered doing something wrong in their entire you are looking for law abiding citizens to work for it is best to look for people who at least portray outwardly some behavior that seems to imply an internal value system that generally jives with what you think of as you never know what is going on in just because someone has never been caught does not mean that everything that they do in their personal life is perfectly legal or ethical or but there are probably want to hire people who are doing very bad things even on their own what you consider to be very bad things may a called may not be illegal in your but could still be for for for for for for the continuum for god for the for for for for for for dungeons and dragons you want to hire people who fit your whether you be government or some sort of a crime consider myself sort of hat i have done black hat kinds of things never gotten and plan on engaging in those kinds of activities on a regular anything in your personal or professional life that people could blackmail you for or put you behind bars for is generally dumb all the way whether you are a criminal or a jedi or just looking to hire people or collecting information that could be used to blackmail people is the worst and certainly far worse than breaking into any have worked in carrier scale job banking and have had access to extremely ridiculous amounts of extremely sensitive data and have written apps against that i get to do that by being a dodo brain in the first you should have access to lots of data is kind of like asking whether or not you should have the one ring from the the lord of the only those who you know have no interest in using it should have high levels of have felt comfortable having been given official professional access to lots and lots of data on the premise that i could spider most of it myself anyways off the internet for were i ever in a real mostly why what me who the type of person who use the one even if i had why usually i have had to share the burden of being on the side of good and have had to hope that the baddies never got in and have had to try my hardest to make sure how things have tended to really a baddie anyway i would like to think of you as my and not my i want to see you to go to jail for anything you did with some ones and and with some if you ever directly or indirectly knowingly put lives or liberties in whether in the name of the empire or in the name of the shame on do the fact there are lots of systems on which the safety of lives directly no bad people should be running those no people who could ever turn bad should be running those think about should anyone have the keys to the systems know who to build a truly secure trust no one not even

hit a lot around the problem but going to mention the underlying problem of which this is just a your data model is almost certainly if you plan to be doing much sql development you should read some introductory books on data one of the first rules of normalization is that entities should not contain repeating groups in for you have columns called is a much better way to model this kind of table contacts int not not constraint primary key clustered table int not not not constraint primary key clustered constraint check in instead of trying to concatenate a string to deal with different columns you can deal with them as a set and get at the phone numbers that you want through business that i use your but it seemed a bit too general and hard to	
	
hit the nail on the head with his multitouch requires hardware a company named stantum that has implemented multitouch on resistive they have windows mobile drivers available and a consistent api across operating systems for the screen however to make use of the technology a phone maker would have had to purchase the screen technology and drivers from the you can see a video of the technology date i know of no windows mobile phones that implement the	
	
hit the nail on the head with the static and dynamic both are part of the new generation of dynamic with lambda and so there are a handful of syntactic differences between the two as but i see a huge difference between groovy and implements lists a bit in pretty much everything is an instance of whereas scala uses both lists and primitive groovy has better string is it but the groovy folks are really pushing performance for the gave a huge leap in speed over the think that either language will really as they target two different classes of scala is a language that is very without having quite the same level of boilerplate as groovy is for rapid prototyping and where speed is less important than the time it takes for programmers to implement the

hitting breakpoints and stepping into gdb version prints the name of the function followed by the function just so in the program one of the parameter values is a huge record being passed by prints the variable name followed by all of its member it literally takes a minute or two to print all the member variables contained in the which is really annoying when pretty sure there is a setting to disable this what is that to get gdb not to print function parameter values when

hope that made let me is a table of tracking data for a quiz program where each row and answerid is a table for so because of a bug there were a bunch of questionids set to but the questionid of a related answerid is in the answers say questionid is null and answerid is if we go to the answers table and find answerid 500 there is a column with the questionid that should have been where the null value basically i want to set each null questionid to be equal to the questionid found in the answers table on the answer row of the answerid that is in the trackings table row as the null questionid that is being would i do questionid some select query that will get the questionid from the answerid in this questionid is null and sure how i will be able to make it assign the questionid to the questionid from the matching update set one column to be equal to a value in a related table referenced by a different	
	
hope you mind me editing the subject of your question but i think that you be so worried about the vst part of your software and the nature of your question is more about driver development than vst you are essentially trying to write a normal midi but you actually need to connect to any so writing a virtual driver is really not as hard as you you just need to find the driver the edit to my answer on your previous more thing i should add is that the best way to accomplish what you are trying to use a separate application with so that is to you write an application which initializes a midi device when and connects to the sequencer via your users would start up the sequencer then your then send the audio on a bus track to your and configure their sequencer to receive midi from the device driver which you would the streams audio from does some type of fft to get the pitches whatever you want to do to the audio and then pushes those events out to the host through the midi driver probably the best way to solve this problem if i understand your project	
	
hoping someone can provide some advise for an easier way to deal with this i am working on creating a flattened view of a highly normalized set of the goal of flattening is to provide a view which normal people can use to develop reports the source data contains a couple of tables as table variables int not null not not primary key unique table int not null references runs on delete int not null references on delete not primary key in the record values table corresponds to one of the variables in the original input say an address or an account for an input record that has 12 variables in there will be twelve rows in the record values inputs to the original process include records of varying widths and variable these are split out into tuples in the i am writing a procedure to reassemble the variables back into a record that looks like is actually an underlying account current approach is to dynamically build the table by finding the unique variables for the given set of runs not important and then building a sql string that will create the challenge is how to efficiently load this resulting work table from the original since the names and number of the variables varies with the only way i can think of to approach this is through something a cursor for the list of each variable in the create a cursor to find all the record values for that for each record update the appropriate in the work is going to run as the parent tables have of millions of anyone have an idea about how to generate an approach that i can use to do one update per destination anyone jump on the design of the original tables there were business reasons to do it this i like but there were good reasons for doing for any thoughts you can flattening name value pairs into a	
	
hoping to display a column in a tabular ui by i mean a column in which a single cell can simultaneously have multiple values aka a list of these values might be drawn from a short list of possibilities an or from a long list another imagine a table of contacts with a column that can refer to zero or more other need the ability to add new remove and ideally the values would be listed horizontally and word i have a feeling that no datagrid control on the planet can do but i figured this is the right forum to ask such a guessing that the current state of the art is to display the information in a not in a table of a we would like to actually display the values in a column of the table in a horizontally editable at this we are planning to use so hoping for a wpf a column using a tabular

i agree with most of the response so far about pair programming being a good i will play advocate and argue that it always make you pair you get a programmer got twice the you get a programmer the of both of your so basically any time that i screw up and my partner catches or finds some way a any time that i write the correct code on my own is a waste of money since my partner you need to evaluate the code working simple tasks are usually not worth the money to pay someone to sit over shoulder and make sure you wrote your for loop at some the tasks are complicated enough to make the roi for pair programming

i bind gridview to then the first time page will be gridview will display columns retrieved from data but if on postback i set to null or to an empty protected void eventargs if then gridview display any rows at but why is gridview has enableviewstate set to then it should be able to display rows it retrieved from data source when page was first realize one could argue that framework notices that datasourceid has changed and assumes gridview need data from previous data but assume framework would realize that empty string or null reference point to any of data source and thus remove any data gridview retrieved from previous data what is going on is once you have set the datasourceid to null or an empty string the control takes this as an indication from the consumer of the control that they do not wish to bind any data at all viewstate the control checks the datasourceid prior to binding and if it is an empty string then it does not databind in its ensuredatabound if you set datasourceid to null inside but gridview only checks datasourceid moments before binding which happens much after then until datasourceid is viewstate containing data from previous data source should still be available inside and still an event handler subscribed to an event that caused a datasourceid to causes gridview to

i just clarify you want to put your machine into german mode to test your web which just happens to be running on the same machine as the this is running for real can we assume that the sever could be hosted outside germany maybe in germany but on a machine set up with a us locale it happens a if so setting the culture on the server really what you and you probably be able to do that when you deploy also have another there is no way you can detect which culture your user wants to you can detect all sorts of info from the http do a domain lookup on the ip but what if a german speaker wanted to use your site from the or an american was in germany and wanted to see and not for the decimal put it another i am saying it matter what culture your pc is using it is not relevant because once you go over the web all bets are off even if your app did detect your culture correctly it might not be what your user the way i would do this is to ask the user what language they want and then explicitly set the locale in your application at run this does mean asking the user to pick a langague but the only way to be sure of using the right locale for the if all your users are german then you have to you can just hard code if his approach sounds like it might work then some good sample code or rather viel

i must say i read the article and please take this the wrong but i think the best way to learn about shortcomings of your own framework or to find out if it meets certain standards is to open it up make it open source and let other developers take part in they will be pretty quick to complain or point out if your only goal in creating this framework is to i think you can benefit from a code and what better way to get a code review than by inviting other people to join you in your way you should also have the chance to challenge the others code and maybe ask questions to find out why they write code a certain hope find this at least a little bit helpful going to take a look at that link

i needed to compare a suggested pattern for idisposable and object finalization with the one we which we have used the one a fair but after looking it the two side by side i had a number of questions about the here is the class implements private disposedvalue as boolean false to detect redundant protected overridable sub disposing as if not if disposing free managed resources when explicitly end free shared unmanaged end end idisposable support this code added by visual basic to correctly implement the disposable public sub implements do not change this put cleanup code in disposing as end is called during gc without being explicitly called first then and the code within will never execute to free the managed in them remaining in memory until the next gc why these be explicitly doing so free more memory on the first gc pass and not leave unneeded objects in memory until the next the ide generate the call when overriding on an idisposable would the gc know to call and ensure that it is the implementation and not a custom implementation which uses the bool parameter in a different as be an interface member if the gc tests for its existence and uses it in a manner that assumes a certain implementation in the presence of both and as why would the gc ever opt to call the i am confused by the supposed added value of having an extended that executes when is called opposed to having a common path that is executed regardless of whether or not was called while i can appreciate that it is provided with good intentions i see how it does anything other than delay the actual release of managed resources if called in essence it seems to only work to make the managed resources unreachable in the object orphaning them until the 2nd gc run rather than freeing them at a point where they are known to be no longer does implement the idisposable interface with a as

i realize this question was asked and but i have specific questions about this that i feel were not clear on that thread and prefer not to get lost in the shuffle on another thread as threads said that rendering the email address to an image the way facebook does is overkill and unprofessional user experience for and it seems that the general consensus is to use a javascript solution using html entities or some other method that breaks up makes the string unreadable by a simple the application building even need the i just need to display the email this is a business web so it needs to as professional as here are my i go the route and pass the html entity version of each are there no web crawlers sophisticated enough to execute the javascript and pull the rendered text or is this considered best practice and completely almost spammer so unprofessional about the image if facebook is one of the highest trafficked applications in the world and not at all run by why is their method completely dismissed in the other thread about this your answer in the other is to not bother myself with this issue and let the spam filters do all the please explain why you feel this we are displaying our email addresses that they have given and i feel responsible to protect them as much as i if you feel this is please explain obfuscation	
	
i recall correctly windows implements at least some subset of posix and so have the signal interface like sigquit never done this but on but you could try setting the unexpected termination trap with quick scan of docs it seems that very few things can be done while handling it may be possible that even starting a new process is on forbidden that thought about probably go with very simple parent thread that does nothing but spawns the worker does all the ui other if it does not set a specific gonna die bit but still dies process always gets message notification that spawned process then master respawns the the main theme is keep master very simple and hard to die due to own

impossible to not knowing the size of and the call to it will preallocate the buffer just once given the length of the format string and the strings that will be inserted and then concatenate everything and insert it into the for very large this will be advantageous over separate calls to which might cause the buffer to expand multiple the three calls to might or might not trigger growth of the buffer and that check is performed each if the strings are small enough and no buffer expansion is then it will be faster than the call to because it have to parse the format string to figure out where to do the data is needed for a definitive should be noted that there is little discussion of using the static method on the using reminded me of his test results show that to be the best case you have to take advantage of specific format does the same thing in that it will predetermine the length of the strings to concatenate and preallocate the buffer slightly more overhead due to looping constructs through the performance is going to be comparable to just the plain addition since it compiles to a call to with the caveat that all of the additions are in the same one call to result a b two calls to result a result all those putting up test need to run your test cases in runs at the perform a gc between the measuring of separate test the reason for this is that if you do creating a new in each iteration of the loop for one and then you run the next test that loops the same number of creating an the gc will more than likely step in during the second test and hinder its

in the process of reviewing a code base and trying to determine how to migrating it from to not an overnight project and the suggestion which i have received is to write new code against java 5 and migrate the old code in a no expert in the new features in java 5 i know of but have never written any for production features of java 5 are typically used in production are there features to be avoided not considered to be are the best refactoring strategies which i can use migrate a code base of this make changes to classes one at a time only when a class is objective reduce risk on the code limitation resources to do advice is appreciated thanks in a year too but better late than you for all of the comments lots of great points of in the life of a software always going to be the projects you strive to finish but never get around to because of something more respect to the use of java 5 that it was something which was required in the production so that was why we did not use java found that the stronger typing for enums and unboxing of primitives were the features i tend to apply the both to old and new the refactoring was fairly but code comprehension improved significantly and standards became easier to the ones i had the most trouble with was the i think a concept which i still had a chance to fully grasp and appreciate so it was difficult for me to find previous cases where the application of generics was again to everyone who contributed to this thread and apologies for the late follow for migrating code base from java to java

initializer in seems to need the as me it works like	
	
initializers simply allow the client to set properties immediately after no control is relinquished as the caller must still ensure all of the constructor arguments are i feel they add very p1 new p2 new age height know a lot of people dislike the i can understand why as it is an openly inviting but i do not mind it providing the type is blindingly p1 new p2 the second line the type is not despite the method i would use the type in this methods i would use very sparingly but they are very useful for extending the types with convenience especially icollection and as an extension method is very as it can be called on null do not think you need to good developers will always use their tools with respect and bad developers will always find ways to misue their limiting the toolset will not solve this	
	
initializers were something added to in order to simplify construction of objects when using an given 0 or more and are used to create and initialize an object the calling method gets the handle to the created for myobjectinstance new this the constructor of myobject will be run with the values param1 and these are both used to create the new myobject in the created object is setup using those gets and set to considered good practice to have a constructor require the parameters needed in order to completely setup an so that impossible to create an object in an invalid there are often properties that could be but are not this could be handled through overloaded but leads to having lots of constructors that necessarily useful in the majority of leads to object initializers an object initializer lets you set properties or fields on your object been but you can use it by anything for myobjectinstance new myproperty will behave exactly the same as if you do myobjectinstance new object initializers are simpler to read when you set multiple so they give you the same benefit as many overloads on the without the need to have many overloads complicating the api for that	
	
initiated into i researched and found that v3 uses a tool to information into wix i have managed to stumble about and find information on this but none of it seems up to date for the latest either i am looking in the wrong or this is thinly so my question is the best way to autogenerate a wix fragment using for a complex folder structure that contains media varying types may change regularly are classified as and included in a that they can be built into an installer via wix and would withstand upgrades and patches with found which seems to solve the autogenerate wix fragment getting the harvester i noticed the harvester is already in project and so noted that might do very search found out of date documentation that mention entire project installer could probably done with but was unsure how well this was and what the pitfalls the generation of and realized that autogeneration of guids would likely have that there must be people who use these tools for similar purposes and could probably point me in the right was pointed out that v3 is not yet the scarceness of documentation and the sense that i get now is that it is to automate this in my build and the tools are growing right now to ease harvesting a with in

interested in i solved this differently than many of the solutions presented times the dictionary and word prefixes into a to 1 the averaging under 10 dictionary load times on the web host server are running about 1 to seconds longer than my home know how badly the times will deteriorate with a load on the wrote my solution as a web page in using the dictionary referenced in the original are not reused in a only words 3 characters or longer are using a hashtable of all unique word prefixes and words instead of a i know about so i learned something the idea of creating a list of prefixes of words in addition to the complete words is what finally got my times down to a respectable the code comments for additional the class avoid using a 2 dimensional array in vb not using typical iteration to find have locked the code into a 4 by 4 grid laid out like find paths the code starts with a letter from a to p the paths available around if a neighboring exists in the path then we go letters are hard coded is a list of only valid paths a word prefix or word is not found the path is and extending that path is dim paths as new the keys are the letters a to value is a string of letters representing neighboring string of neighboring letters is split and iterated dim neigborsof as new the keys are mapped to the lettered grid of a to values are what the user inputs on the dim boggleletters as new to store last postition of this will be a a to dim lastpositionofpath as string found a hashtable was by far faster than a about 10 times this stores prefixes of words and determined 792773 was the number of words and unique prefixes be generated from the dictionary this is a max number final hashtable will not have that dim hashtableofprefixesandwords as new words that are dim foundwords as new to validate what the user enters in the dim errorfoundwithsubmittedletters as boolean public sub thispath as is the word correlating to the thispath path would be a series of letters from a to dim word as string path is iterated through and a word based on the in the boggle grid is for i as integer 0 to word my hashtable of word prefixes and words contain this this a word and any further extension of thispath will any words so exit sub to terminate exploring this if not then exit value of my hashtable is a boolean representing if the key if a word a prefix if true and at least 3 letters long then word if andalso 2 then my list of paths contain thispath then add only valid paths will make it this paths not the hashtableofprefixesandwords cause this sub to exit if not then the last letter of we are looking to extend the our neighboring letters if any are still lastpositionofpath through my list of neighboring letters grid for each neighbor as string in i find a neighboring grid point that i already thispath then extend thispath and feed the new path recursive if not then end protected sub sender as byval e as handles has entered the 16 letters and clicked the go up my of grid using letters a to p an grid the values are neighboring letters the user user entered something with a length of 1 for all 16 for each s as string in if 1 errorfoundwithsubmittedletters exit end input is not valid if errorfoundwithsubmittedletters error assume we have 16 letters to work with and start finding dim sb as new dim time as string dim numofletters as integer dim word as string dim tempword as string dim letter as string dim fr as streamreader fr new fill my hashtable with word prefixes and while word tempword for i as integer 0 to letter optimization helped quite a words in the dictionary that letters that the user did not enter in the grid go in my realize most of the solutions went with a never heard of that is one of the neat things about seeing how others approach learning some best i code a trie in my i just have a hashtable with words in the dicitonary file and all possible prefixes for those trie might be faster but not coding it getting good times with if i 0 andalso not then continue tempword if not tempword end end of word prefixes and words in time time starts a path at each point on the grid an builds a path until string of letters correlating to the path is not found in the word prefixes and time of words end end

interesting train of what the article on wikipedia collects a few changes in the changes in the usage updated changes through a way to stem is a constant factor two every 18 to 24 since the environment contains more than the i would assume that this forms only a very weak lower bound on actual change in the change in operations per second per dollar over is harder to but evidence in the frequency of occurrences of the words of in the say that expectations grow exponentially by looking at the development of basic economy tells us that supply is growing faster than giving law as upper bound of user use of business functionality an information system provides to a as a measure of change in required function points over depends totally on the organisation and is usually quite high immediately before a when quick fixes are pushed through and when integrating big changes to various measures like or implemented function points over time can be used as a another possibility would be in the ticketing if stay with implemented function points over change in implemented function points over can be measured as time spent implementing new time spent refactoring over bitrot would a combined unit of is of course only a very forced notation of what the wikipedia article already bitrot arises from changes in the changes in the requirements and changes to the while it is mitigated by spending time on every organisation will have to decide for itself how to measure those i only give very general

is about set or more relational read a brief primer on and learn to think in not in the practical there are four fundamental which show some projection of a which remove some subset of a which add rows to a which change data in a i mean any including the empty and not necessarily a proper i can write a column name in ddl as the target of an i can write an expression that uses column or 3 from will return the resultset 2 once for each row in the if the column named is of type and the function returns a month number given a from will show me the month number for each where clause is a predicate that restricts rows or or updated to those rows for which the predicate is a where cause can be composed of an arbitrary number of predicates connected by the logical operators and just like the column list in a i can use column and constants in my what result set do you think is returned from from table where 1 a tables are related by in which some datum or key in one is related by an operator to a datum or key in another the relational operator is often but can in fact be any binary operator or even a are as i mentioned by a row in a table may relate to or many rows in another this is referred to as the cardinality of the relations may be there are standard ways of representing each before you look up the standard ways to do think about how represent each what the minimum requirements of each kind see that a relation can in fact also model and ask yourself given all relations are not among pioneered the idea of normal form in relational there are commonly held to be five or six normal but the most important summary of normal form is every entity that your database models should be represented by one row and one row every attribute should depend on the and every row should model an entity or a a primer on normal and understand why you can get data inconsistencies if a your database all try to understand why i like to say you lie to the it will lie to by this i mean bad i mean bad if you model a relation as what can be what can happen if your tables in practical is a select query given a name and stored in the if i often join table to table through the relation maybe i can write a view that selects the columns of interest from that and use the view instead of alway rewriting the write a whatever be simpler and clearer if you write a view for every calculation or you write a view that encapsulates each write a view that encapsulates each almost anything you want to do can be done in a a query into views serves the same ends as functional decomposition serves in procedural it allows you to concentrate on doing one thing makes it more easily and allows you to compose more complex functionality out of simpler an example where i use views to transform a table into forms that more easily allow me to apply successive in order to get to a conflate each table ought to unambiguously model one thing kind of and only one each column should express one and only one attribute of that different kinds of entities belong in different is your your database platform will provide some what it provide you should since metadata is all the rules for modeling data you can for the names of all objects in your database from the sytem table contains all the to find all the columns in one join and on and add a clause restricting the resultset to a particular table sit down at a database and ask can i represent people with hair colors and professions and what tables and relations are implied in modeling then model as ask can i show all blonde doctors who reside in and write the query that does piece it together by writing views that show you all all and all people who reside in find that in asking can i find expose deficiencies in your and find that you want or even need to change the way your model make the see how they make your queries easier or harder to

is actually a really excellent and the short answer is we used to do it that and there was a whole area of enterprise in the common ood notations evolved from we was that designs like that had some the biggest of them being that the natural structure for a data base necessarily match well to the natural structure for to a great derives from the desire to make it easier to find a code structure that has a couple of desirable should be easy to think out the should be robust under ease to think out design comes originally from which used what we now think of as for simulation it was convenient in simulation to have software entities that correspond to the things it was only later that alan kay et al at xerox saw that as a more general structuring part about robustness under changes had many but one of the most important ones among them was dave you wrote several papers that identified a basic rule for which i call every module should keep a and that secret is a requirements that is likely to turns out that by combining law with the simula idea of a as corresponding to something that can be identified with the real you to get system designs that are more robust under requirements changes than the old way we did and sometime you have to be as with the most objects are thing that have persistent in the command the ideal objects are things you it also turns out that that structure necessarily a good way to represent the underlying data in a relational so we end up with the relational impedance how to represent the transformation from objectland to

is answered in answer to can i tell whether a certain element is contained in a list or search the you could search through the list of all questions in using your favorite the command you can use the switch to perldoc to search for you would have found your answer by searching for of this answer contributed by anno siegel and brian d the word is an indication that you probably should have used a not a list or to store your hashes are designed to answer this question quickly and arrays being there are several ways to approach in perl and you can use the smart match operator to check that an item is contained in an array or a say array contains say hash contains earlier versions of you have to do a bit more if you are going to make this query many times over arbitrary string the fastest way is probably to invert the original array and maintain a hash whose keys are the first cerulean teal turquoise 1 you can check whether it might have been a good idea to keep the blues all in a hash in the first the values are all small you could use a simple indexed this kind of an array will take up less 1 or simply x you check whether the values in question are integers instead of you can save quite a lot of space by using bit strings 2017 1 check whether is true for some methods guarantee fast individual tests but require a of the original list or they only pay off if you have to test multiple values against the same you are testing only the standard module exports the function first for this it works by stopping once it finds the written in c for and its perl equivalent looks like this first my foreach return if speed is of little the common idiom uses grep in scalar context returns the number of items that passed its to traverse the entire this does have the benefit of telling you how many matches it grep eq you want to actually extract the matching simply use grep in list grep eq

is based on previous experiences with what i consider to be the best practices on the scale of the code this can range from another developer to the whole team in the case of something big being added to the overall for small the review is mainly a way to double check what was done while on the larger everyone should know what is going on and be able to ask questions to those who put in the new to it for large it makes sense to have more eyes on it while if the code change was to fix a that merit the same any completion of a code bug or new functionality should merit some form of diffing in subversion is useful for some reviews though think there should be other stuff out i just seen few other reviews can vary from seeing the differences in code and results of the application to going line by line through pages of printed out i like a more formal structure which tries to be simple in terms of communicating what was why and seeing that it does what it should for big this can take hours but then if the developers that did the work went on vacation and it had to be changed asap it would take longer to understand what is going on in some i

is dead easy to i built the following convenience they are structured so that you can construct an assembly from fragments of source code defining methods or expressions and invoke them by name using the helper methods of code is compiled on demand in response to adding more methods will cause automatic recompilation on next provide only a method if you want to return a value then return null and bother to use the object returned by you use this in commercial code do me a favour and credit my the real jewel in this library is the invocation getting the code to compile the quite tricky to get reflection to correctly match the method signature when you have a variable length parameter this is the reason for the existence of the compiler resolves method binding to this explicitly declared base class giving us access to the right from there on in it all comes out in the should also point out that this capability makes your desktop application vulnerable to script injection you should either take great care to vet the origin of script or reduce the trust level under which the generated assembly public abstract class public bool params methodname bindingflags flags return public object params bindingflags flags return public double params functionname bindingflags flags return public static class internal statics and static new static new static string codestart public class dynamic static string dynamicconditionprefix static string conditiontemplate bool return static string methodtemplate object static string codeend static new static assembly public static assembly assembly get return manage public static void public static void if else if public static void string if throw new is already a condition called stringbuilder src new the condition is invalid an exception will occur public static void string if throw new is already a method called if throw new is not a valid method name because the prefix is reserved for internal use with stringbuilder src new the condition is invalid an exception will occur use public static object params dynamicbase if as return public static bool params dynamicbase if as return public static double params dynamicbase if as return support public static string stringbuilder cn new foreach c in if string conditionname return private static void if stringbuilder src new foreach kvp in foreach kvp in private static assembly compilerparameters cp new compilerresults cr if throw new return public static bool return

is detailed of why is both more efficient and less biased than from the sun forums post that gili linked uses uses twice to generate a double that has approximately uniformly distributed bits in its so it is uniformly distributed in the range 0 to uses less than twice on it uses it and if the value obtained is above the highest multiple of n below it tries otherwise is returns the value modulo n prevents the values above the highest multiple of n below skewing the so returning a value which is uniformly distributed in the range 0 to to scaling by the output of is one of possible values drawn from a uniform by 6 alter the number of possible and casting to an int then forces these values into one of six each bucket corresponding to ranges encompassing either 1501199875790165 or 1501199875790166 of the possible values 6 is not a disvisor of this means that for a sufficient number of dice rolls a die with a sufficiently large number of the die will show itself to be biased towards the larger will be waiting a very long time rolling dice for this effect to show also requires about twice the processing and is subject to

is generally a horrible as anyone worked in a localized ide can attest programmers rely heavily on having one common when the compiler gives me the error type specifier int i can share this exact error message with for example here on and it will be to those others so they can tell me what it if the compiler instead generated error messages in be limited to getting help from the relatively few programmers who speak my vocabulary is no longer the same as someone in the same position in france or we can no longer exchange bug fixes or developer in spain be able to use my code because it was literally written in another and if i had trouble with my others would be helpless to debug because it even compile under their localization settings if it still be unreadable to a programming language is it may have borrowed some words from but it not and you do not need to understand english to program in any more than i need to understand latin in order to speak english borrows latin words as might as well ask for a would be the it would in theory allow people who speak english speak it just be the same english as every other so it actually enable communication between keyword in a programming language is the same as if in the english they mean different even though one was obviously inspired by the keyword in does not mean the same thing as in nor does or they are not english they are keywords or concepts in python or any other programming

is not exactly a technical since i know c kind of enough to do the things i need to in terms of not the language get in your so this question is basically a direction to i am currently taking an advanced algorithms and for the sake of up as i am required to use pure c to implement the practical assignments works pretty much any small mistake you make actually forces you to understand completely what doing in order to fix in the course of i obviously run into the problem of having to implement the data structures from the ground actually not only linked but also et am focusing on lists in this topic because typically a structure i end up using a lot in the either as a structure or as a structure for other bigger ones a hash tree that resolves conflicts by using a linked requires that the list stores elements of lots of different i am assuming here as a premise that i want to the list for every i can come up with these a list of void pointers harder to only one but having a as containing all element types i will use in the program to wastes space if elements are not all the same a preprocessor macro to regenerate the code for every in the style of stl waste elements have the explicit type they actually are when they are change in list code can be really make the question which one of the above is since i am basically in an academic i am also very interested in the view of people working with pure c out there in the i understand that most pure c programmers are in the embedded devices where i think this kind of problem i am facing is if anyone out there knows how done the real i would be very interested in your linked list implementation in pure

is nothing especially about function they allow you to call a function which is specified at but you have exactly the same overhead as get from any other function call the additional pointer since the function to call is determined at the compiler can typically not inline the function call as it could anywhere as function pointers may in some cases add up to be significantly slower than a regular function pointers have nothing to do with and should never be used to gain they are a very slight nod to the functional programming in that they allow you to pass a function around as parameter or return value in another simple example is a generic sorting it has to have some way to compare two elements in order to determine how they should be this could be a function pointer passed to the sort and in fact can be used exactly like if you ask it to sort sequences of a type that does not define the less than you have to pass in a function pointer it can call to perform the this leads us nicely to a superior in not limited to function you often use functors instead that classes that overload the so that they can be as if they were functors have a couple of big advantages over function offer more with destructor and member they can maintain and they may expose other member functions that the surrounding code can are unlike function whose type only encode the signature of the function variable of type may be function which takes an int and returns we know which a type encodes the precise function that should be called a functor is a call it we know that the function to call and will always and this means the compiler can inline the function the magic that makes the generic just as fast as your sorting function designed specifically for your the compiler can eliminate all the overhead of calling a are very little type safety in a function you have no guarantee that it points to a valid it could be and most of the problems with pointers apply to function pointers as dangerous and pointers or functors or delegates all solve the same with different levels of elegance and they allow you to treat functions as passing them around as you would any other you can pass a function to another and it will call your function at specified times a timer when the window needs or when it needs to compare two elements in your far as i know i could be because i worked with java for java have a direct you have to create a which implements an and defines a function it for and then instead of calling the function the shape of a function functor or you call similar to the implementation in but without the generality of and without the function syntax that allows you to treat function pointers and functors the same that is where you use function when more sophisticated alternatives are not available you are stuck in and you need to pass one function to the most common scenario is a you define a function f that you want the system to call when x so you create a function pointer pointing to and pass that to the system in forget about john carmack and assume that anything you sees in his code will magically make your code better if you copy he used function pointers because the games you mention were written in where superior alternatives are not and not because they are some magical ingredient whose mere existence makes code run

is often the there seem to be one right answer for know what advantage there is to using the same element tag for the request and you for use and as separate that might be a bit more and would also strengthen the argument for using distinct namespaces for the two message if you have good reasons for using as the tag for both request and then you define a schema such that is a the union members would contain elements that are appropriate for either requests or but not this structure would make it easier to keep the two sides in the same if that seems like the right thing to be a little more inclined to go this route if i saw the request and response protocols as being tightly such that changes to one probably require changes to the other as if the types of information in the response set can change over time by then separate namespaces would make more

is possible you might want to store both the formatted and unformatted versions of the for use american phone numbers as an if you store one column with just the numbers and one column with the most frequently needed such as then you can easily format to client specifications for the special cases or pull the most common one out quickly without lots of this takes very little extra time at the time of insert can be accomplished with a calculated column so it always happens no matter where the data came should be scrubbed before being put in the database so that invalid dates or nonnumeric data etc ever placed in the email is one field that people often put junk into for some if it have an it be this is especially true if you actually send emails thorugh your using that it is a waste of time to try to send an email to his or if you see what i the format will be consistently it is better to convert the data to that format once on insert or update and not have to convert it ever if the standard format you will need to update the column for all existing records at that then use the new format going if you have frequent changes of format and large tables or if differnt applications use different it might be best to store

is quite the short answer to your question is not with the basic input real answer maybe with some trickery with facebook does something close to when you write a new message to multiple persons in you can type their names this sort of each recognized new name is added a bit like an tag here and has an small cross next to it for removing they seem to is fake the input area size by drawing an box and removing all styling from the actual input with then they have plenty of logic done with javascript so that if you have added an friend as a tag and start it will remove the whole friends name at but takes plenty of effort and adds accessibility

is supposed to the leftmost not the leftmost this means the query is doing what you even if the first character is a multibyte guessing the sign emerges due to a as returns how many a string takes so if this query gives you any results of 2 or this means that is indeed returning multibyte characters and your problem lies beyond the query you are executing the query at the command maybe your terminal cannot render the or otherwise they are getting mangled somewhere if you are using a scripting try to use that string and to help find out going since you are using try a character returned from the database in print out the value of each byte in the echo for example the result is then you should get if you do indeed get this kind of then php is getting the multibyte character and the problem is either in the encoding of the web page itself w3c or the cannot render that particular

is to do with how overloaded methods are the compiler first looks at the declared type of the expression in this case and looks for candidate methods are first declared in that if there are any methods which are appropriate where all the arguments can be converted to the parameter then it look at any parent this means that overridden where the initial declaration is in a parent get a if there are any appropriate methods in the derived a slightly simpler public virtual void derived public override void public void static void derived d new prints even though the compiler knows there is a matching method with a parameter of type and the argument is type and the conversion from to is than the conversion from to the fact that only the method is originally in means the compiler ignores is highly surprising i can see why it would be the case if override otherwise introducing a more method in the base class could change the behaviour unexpectedly but clearly here about as overriding this is one of the points where i believe the designers made the wrong

is what basically is free software which lets you publish and obtain information on the internet without fear of to achieve this the network is entirely decentralized and publishers and consumers of information are without anonymity there can never be true freedom of and without decentralization the network will be vulnerable to contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of their hard drive the for storing unlike other file sharing freenet does not let the user control what is stored in the data files are kept or deleted depending on how popular they with the least popular being discarded to make way for newer or more popular files in the data store are encrypted to reduce the likelihood of prosecution by persons wishing to censor freenet biggest problem is that both in transfer speed and even if you can get lots of people with decent upload still never be as quick a dedicated servers or the speed is fine for what freenet is data without fear of but not for hosting your bigger problem is the content has to be static which rules out use for a majority of to serve dynamic data each peer would have to execute code and would probably have to retrieve data from a database would be another big again because of the think is about as close to p2p as see for the time

is where comes in very the idea i understand it at very new to is that the window itself is bound to a the viewmodel class is just a class that represents all the data in a way that your entire page has access to everything it simply brings together all the different objects need to bind to in one you set the datacontext of the window to an instance of this your userinfo and userinfoextended instances are public properties of the viewmodel and you just use the path of your binding element to get you through the appropriate properties of the appropriate objects you wish to bind each control a great quite video explaining this and it goes through a full example that illustrates many ways to accomplish this and many different reasons why this is a convenient and scalable model to use in a wpf it also covers many features of wpf as well as an introduction to dependency which are very relevant topics as given the a link to the blog post which contains a link to the video speaking

jit compiled languages know if clr does this or jvm a common optimisation to convert a virtual call which has only two or three implementations into a sequence of tests on the type and direct or inline advantage of this is that modern pipelined cpus can use branch prediction and prefetching of direct but an indirect call by a function pointer in high level often results in the pipeline the limiting where there is only one implementation of the virtual call and the body of the call is small the virtual call reduced to purely this technique was used in the which the jvm evolved compilers perform the whole program analysis required to perform this but projects such as llvm are looking at whole program optimisations such as

joins produce results that consist of every combination of rows from two or more that means if table a has 6 rows and table b has 3 a cross join will result in 18 there is no relationship established between the two tables you literally just produce every possible an inner column values from one row of a table are combined with column values from another row of another the table to form a single row of a where clause is added to a cross it behaves as an inner join as the where imposes a limiting long as your queries abide by common sense and vendor specific i like to think of the decision on which type of join to use to be a simple matter of	
	
jon and really are foreign if you declare them as not declaring them speeds you up by a trivial but it also allows you to store illegitimate values in those two columns you want to prevent invalid inserts in those columns for the same reason that you want to cascade	
	
jon much of this assumes the risk of seeming comments like these just bother to write programs correctly is difficult and time should be avoided is practically impossible to write software that does anything significant without leveraging threads in some if you are on open your task enable the thread count and you can probably count on one hand the number of processes that are using a single one should not simply use threads for the sake of using threads nor should it be done but i believe these cliches are used too i had to boil multithreaded programming down for the true i would say jumping into first understand that the the class boundary is not the same as a thread for if a callback method on your class is called by another thread the asynccallback delegate to the understand that the callback executes that other so even though the callback occurs on the same you still have to synchronize access to the members of the object within the callback threads and classes are it is important to understand this what data needs to be shared between once you have defined the shared try to consolidate it into a single class if the places where the shared data can be written and if you can get this down to one place for writing and one place for you will be doing yourself a tremendous this is not always but it is a nice goal to shoot make sure you synchronize access to the shared data using the monitor class or the lock use a single object to synchronize your shared data regardless of how many different shared fields there this will simplify it may also overly constrain things in which you may need a synchronization object for each shared and at this using immutable classes becomes you have one thread that needs to signal another i would strongly recommend using the manualresetevent class to do this instead of using sum i would say that threading is not but it can be a properly threaded application will be more and your users will be most is nothing about asynchronous the various method in if these techniques make it easier to accomplish various tasks in a threaded if you have a gui application that does any heavy or it is practically impossible to make the responsive to the user without leveraging threads behind the the techniques i mentioned above make this possible and are a breeze to it is important to understand the to be i simply believe we do especially younger a disservice when we talk about how multithreaded programming is or how threads be comments like these oversimplify the problem and exaggerate the myth when the truth is that threading has never been there are legitimate reasons to use and cliches like this just seem counterproductive to

just occurred to is a wild guess and probably not but maybe having a delayed ack problem due to your send buffer being smaller than the size of the data nagle may have nothing to do with the receiving side send any data back if your peer will delay ack for up to 200ms waiting to piggy back ack on some data to make better use of the send buffer on the socket is smaller than the data in this case the call to write will block until the ack has been received and all the data example if your send buffer is 8192 bytes and you send 8193 bytes and your peer sends no data back then your write will block for 200ms or however long your peers implementation delays the effectively making it look like nagle is killing you even when this is the case you could either increase the send buffer size or have your peer always send you back a null byte to force the ack to be sent i would maybe try playing around with a bit to model your applications send receive patterns and see if maybe something else is going

key piece of information in the question is percent we can shave off processing time saves us tens thousands of dollars per you need to consider much it will to shave each percent if that optimization effort costs tens of thousands of dollars per then it worth you could make a bigger saving by firing a the right skills today are rarer and therefore more you can assembler to get the fastest possible with slightly less rare you can do almost as well with some really c and so the more performance you squeeze out of the more it will cost you in development and there will be diminishing returns for ever greater if the profit from this stays at of thousands of dollars per then there will come a point where it is no longer worth the in fact i would hazard a guess already at that point because of thousands of dollars per is in the range of one and probably not enough to buy the skills required to a complex would guess that if you have code already written in the effort of rewriting it all as a direct translation in another language will be wasted it will very likely perform slower simply because you be taking advantage of the capabilities of the but instead working against trying to use java as if it was within your existing there will be parts that make a crucial contribution to the running time run and other parts that are totally irrelevant run so if you have some idea for speeding up the there is no economic sense in wasting time applying it to the parts of the program that affect the running use a profiler to find the hot and see where time is being wasted in the existing when i noticed the reference to the code being that if you focus your effort on removing bottlenecks so that your program can scale well over a large number of then it will automatically get faster every year at a rate that will dwarf any other optimization you can this time next quad cores will be standard on the year after 8 cores will be getting cheaper bought one over a year ago for a few thousand and i would predict that a 32 core machine will cost less than a developer by that	
	
keybindings do you want to all events on the shoes app or just the default you want to override bindings reserved for shoes like paste the following code into the file which contains your application def gets called on def gets called on def gets called on above code the shoes code and does nothing when the corresponding keys are can use the same technique for rest of the default grep the shoes source for the key find the corresponding method and define an empty method within your app to override the	
	
keys will need absolute uniqueness not high probability of i would suggest using guids instead of hashes for your keys for generate the hash as a quick look up mechanism you can have a index on this but in the case of collision have to compare the actual data to make sure they are the in synchronizing your databases you can check the hash using the and if you find a then resolve whether the data is the same thus the guids needs to be if there is no then simply update whichever database needs the missing entry and insert using the guid from the other see little point in creating your own hash of hashes to save if you already have the other just use them if just use a standard hash function like md5 or sha1 and store the resulting

kinda have to put my previous c questions on hold cause this one is more important have already coded the insert and delete functions on my binary search tree but the delete function is a couple of things i need help is my insert function good or can it be improved my delete function lacks the deletion of a node with both the left and right searched a lot in the past few hours but find a proper way to do how should i delete a node with 2 child as in the first is the delete function good or can it be this one i know it can because repeating lots of code in those ifs but i see how can i improve i need help on that struct sclientprofile struct sclienttree struct sclientprofile char int int struct sclienttree clientprofile char clienttree clienttree clientprofile clienttree new else else char int ncompare else else clienttree cliptr cliptr else clienttree cliptr else clienttree cliptr else missing delete probably notice but let me just make 2 tree uses strings instead of the normal int why i use all the i think using it not using i rather pass the pointer a structure pointer in this and work with it looks more clean somehow and in the future i want to return a success value if a node was already did my iterative version of the delete function but i like some things about maybe they can be improved but i see also tried to code the case it was deleting a node with 2 but not working as it commented the whole code where i think the code can be improved and the also named those problems as b no b c and d so we can reference to them char return clienttree currptr clienttree prevptr int ncompare prevptr currptr else prevptr currptr else the following cases have 3 lines in the calls and return is there anyway to this code and make it more of the are to be return else else return else clienttree tempptr tempptr this has a big if you take a look at the clientprofile in the first see two and one the problem is that the following code line is copying the integer not the for the string remains the old i tried to use directly on clientname but it still why everything is being copied but the is there anyway to not call the function and make the while loop once again and delete corresponding return return to properly in a binary search tree in

least take advantage of native datatypes that will do wrapping in the fastest for wrapping integers would be to make sure your data is scaled to or whatever native then when you need your data to wrap the native data type will be done in very and orders of magnitude than any software wrapping implementation seen an example case have found this to be very useful when i need a fast implementation of implemented using a for a basically you make scale your data such that is pi and is then have you are set to a side scaling your data will add some up front finite computation cost that usually looks something fixedpoint floatingpoint free to exchange int for something else you want like fastest more the mod operation is slow instead if possible try to use bit of the solutions i skimmed are functionally but they are dependent on the mod mod operation is very slow because it is essentially doing a the laymans explanation of why mod and division are slow is to equate the division operation to some def of and as you can the hardware can be if it is a low number relative to the but division can also horribly slow if it is much greater than the you can scale your data to a power of two then you can use a bit mask which will execute in one cycle on of all platforms and speed improvement will be approximately one order of magnitude at the very least 2 or 3 times faster code to implement int return a b int return a b free to make the something that is run and feel free to adjust the bit mask to be whatever power of two that you like 0xffffffff or power of two you decide on i strongly suggest reading about fixed point processing when messing with i suggest an introduction by randy yates august

little background designing an application that uses a architecture consisting server which loads potentially developed by other client which loads corresponding modules potentially developed by those other each client module corresponds with a server client side communicates with the server side for general and as well as module specific this i think that means client talks to client modules talk to server is and client side is deployment scenario introduces the potential to upgrade the any the and any module being able to using mismatched versions is therefore concerned about versioning thinking so windows service for the for the server to load and communicate with the server modules will give us the greatest flexibility in terms of version compatability between server and server server and each server module vend wcf services for communication to the client communication between the server and a server or between two server modules use the addin advantage of this is that a module can expose a different interface within the server and outside the client uses to and communicate with the client communications with client modules is via the addin communications from the client and from client modules to the server side are via maximum each module will run in a separate the system has modest performance so marshalling and crossing process boundaries is not expected to be a performance requirement is basically summed up get in the way of the other parts of the system not described questions are around the idea of having two different communication and versioning models to work with which will be an added burden on our seems quite but also a little also unsure of commitment to it in the on the other not thrilled with versioning i have a feeling that it would be possible to implement the system within but being fairly new to both i would have no idea of where to am i on the right track am i doing this the hard are there gotchas i need to be aware of on this architecture using wcf and

looking for the best way to store a set of as well as comments on those posts in imagine a design similar to a on facebook where users can write posts on their wall and other users can comment on those i need to be able to display all wall posts as well as the i first started i came up with a table such table id uuid not posted timestamp not userid uuid not posterid uuid not parentid uuid not comment text not is parentid will be null on original posts and point to an id if the row is a comment on an existing easy enough and super fast to insert new doing a select which would return of which order the rows existed in the database proved to be extremely i obviously just order by as someone might comment on post 1 after post 2 has been if i do a left join to get the parent post on all and then sort by that date all the original posts group together as have a value of i got this table id uuid not threadposted posted comment an original threadposted and posted would be the on a timestamp would be the time the original post was posted and would be the time the comment on that thread was now i can just from wallposts order by works however one thing irks if two people create a post at the same comments on the two posts would get munged together as have the same i could use instead of a but still the accuracy is only of a i could also setup a unique constraint on threadposted and posted which makes inserts a bit more but if i had multiple database servers in a the chance of a collision is still i almost went ahead with this anyway since the chances of this happening are extremely but i wanted to see if i could eat my cake and still have it mostly for my own educational solution would be to store this data in the form of a each node would have a and i could order by which would traverse the tree in the order i every time someone inserts a comment have to re balance the whole this would create a ton of row and all sorts of problems if the site was very kinda extreme and also causes replication so i tossed this idea also thought about just storing the original posts and then serializing the comments in a binary since who cares about individual this would be very however if a user wants to delete their comment or append a new comment to the i have to deserialize this modify the then serialize it back and update the if a bunch of people are commenting on the same post at the same i might have random issues with what i eventually i query for all the posts ordered by date in the middle ware i loop through the recordset and create a of original each node on the stack points to a linked list of when i come across an original i push a new node on the stack and when i come across a comment i add a node to the linked i organize this in memory so i can traverse the recordset once and have after i create the representation of the i traverse through this data structure again and write out this works great and has super fast inserts and super fast and no weird row locking however a bit heavier on my presentation layer and requires me to build an in memory representation of the wall to move stuff around so in the right i believe this is the best approach found so thought check with other sql experts to see if a better way to do this using some weird joins or unions or something which would still be performant with millions of is the best way to store a threaded message in

looks like trying to port from ruby to if it might be easier to use a native memcache client implementation such i generally agree with markusq that translating from a language to a language is probably going to be less productive overall than just rewriting in an idiomatic fashion for the target a straight translation from ruby to is going to give you some very ugly at yield ruby keyword allows you to invoke a block of code that was passed as an implicitly declared argument to the for you can think of the method definition as actually looking more ttl when you call as stuff in the braces gets assigned to the variable block in the expanded definition yield then invokes the code in this is a gross but should help you get the general to your the simplification i just did necessarily going to get you because as soon as you find a way to translate that another piece of code will break your for say a given method needs to inspect the if no arguments load defaults from config file and ignore of course since lambdas are objects in you may encounter code like the lambda a b c foo is now defined as a function that sums its three then god help you if you encounter code that defines methods on the or fo a takes advantages of malleable def puts prints def puts prints prints still prints each instance of each class in ruby can have its own class not really sure how you would port even simple examples to without fancy ruby has a lot of these features that will break a simple translation so i would recommend learning the thing trying to and then redoing it from

main benefits of using real foreign keys are ensuring data and being able to set up cascading actions on related items when something is modified or imagine programming a you have a table with primary key and you have a table where posts are attached to topics with the column which is a foreign key to the topics foreign key relationship ensures that every post is attached to a valid if the only topic you have has id impossible for there to exist a post in the database attached to topic the database ensures the cascading you can set it up so that if a topic is deleted from the topic the database automatically deletes all the posts in the posts table that were attached to this this is nice because it removes a step that you have to remember to do which can get quite complex when you have many tables linked with foreign keys all the relationships can be cleaned up

main reason being that when you use the you never know about the just the interface and an abstract method has that as the method is abstract it has no details since they must be defined by the derived the main point that makes this possible is that the and never change as the method is abstract in the base therefore the interface is just not the of it like someone selling basic airline tickets from point a to b not knowing what airline was going to be they have no idea how you will get there yet but once they hand off the contract of the sold ticket to an that airline will figure out the details of meeting the contracts all you cared about when buying the ticket was that you knew for x dollars you were going to get from a to

make sense to talk about variables in because nothing analogous to a declaration in the languages designed for compilers have declarations because the compiler needs to know in advance how big datatypes are and how to access different parts of if i say in the compiler knows that somewhere there is some memory set aside for and as big as it needs to be to hold a pointer to an eventually the linker will hook all the references to but at least the compiler knows out there typically set an initial value for something least in the familiar compiled if exist before the then i guess you could call this a since that is when ruby has to assign a value to the symbol is a specific term that people typically use to distinguish the static assignment of a value to some variable from that in you have that kind of you typically just say a variable is if been assigned a value somewhere in your current and you say if it usually talk about it having a because in ruby that just amounts to no special context that would justify you saying like there is in other brings us can definitely call this an since it is assigning a value to the symbol i think anyone will disagree with

mentioned counting the number of set bits in a byte as a programming question in his guide to and talked of a way to take advantage of patterns that occur in the lookup i wrote an article about it awhile back after i found the of bits set in a byte in 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 5 6 6 7 6 7 7 first row and column are exactly the and each position in the grid can be calculated by adding the first values in that row and because of you only need a lookup table with 16 entries for an and can just use the first 16 if you wanted to count the set bits in the number for just 243 16 15 243 16 are there six bits set in the number 11110011 next pattern i noticed after that was that each time you double the size of the nxn each quadrant could be calculated by adding and 2 to each like make a 4x4 grid on the and fill in the upper left quadrant with the values of the 2x2 for each add the value from that same quadrant in the 2x2 grid to the upper left quad add 0 to each number from 2x2 1 2 upper right quad add 1 to each number from 1 1 2 2 2 3 lower left quad add 1 to each number from 1 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 lower right quad add 2 to each number from 1 1 2 2 2 3 2 2 3 3 3 this process two more and get the 16x16 grid from so i figured there must be some sort of quadtree algorithm that would allow you to start from the given a number generate the lookup table on the fly and figure out the number of so my you figure out an algorithm to do just of set bits in a

method of dynamically loading script files using dom methods like is meaning that the page does not wait for it to load before running any further if you did not want this asynchronous you could load them with regular elements in your or you could mess around with a xmlhttprequest to grab it and to run probably want to do because being asynchronous makes the entire page load you will probably just need to add some logic that waits for the dynamically loaded script to have loaded before you go on with the next bit of this involve polling using until you notice a variable from the included script has been you could add code in the included script that calls a method to whatever has been waiting for you could look at how jquery does something look for where the ajax method is specifically these script then later if do script

might be tricky of its nature or my way of describing so really read this before have this app to desktop no data layer in sense of files or any other repository need to store or load app will have some computation algorithms implemented provides gui which will display controls for app and computations am thinking about using mvc pattern but i have doubts how to use since i have no data layer in sense of database is generated during execution based on user i am concerned about way of using mvc in this so far i have came up with two is the geneticalgorithm is the geneticalgorithmresults is the model class that only stores basic view sends user input to the controller is processing user input and generates controller sends generated data to the model notifies the view about new view pulls new data and updates the is the appengine is the geneticalgorithm nad geneticalgorithmresults are the now we view sends user input to the controller is processing user input and sends control signals to the model updates its internal state new model notifies the controller about new controller pulls data to controller processes controller pushes processed data to the view updates the approach seems to be more straightforward and more like the problem is that some logic would have to be in the model decide when to notify the model as not all data updates will be or maybe display will be updated with the sets of data not every little those decisions will be based on user whats more some additional processing of the data may be needed before actual this would be in the the other hand second approach seems to be more complicated and looks like to much messages are being passed to achieve the but it gives full control of logic to the controller and separates responsibilities of the the controller and the model is the main purpose of approach would you or maybe i should mix them and use first approach architecture with communication flow from second or some different for desktop app with no data

modern architectures will have some instruction for finding the position of the lowest set or the highest set or counting the number of leading zeroes you have any one instruction of this class you can cheaply emulate the a moment to work through it on paper and realise that will clear the lowest set bit in and x will return just the lowest set irrespective of word length knowing it is trivial to use hardware to find the lowest set bit if there is no explicit instruction to do there is no relevant hardware support at the implementation of given or one of the ones on the twiddling page can trivially be converted to give lowest set bit using the above identities and has the advantage of being

most common reasons and use cases for generics are described in the msdn documentation mentioned one benefit of generics like to add is that they can enhance the tool support in the development refactoring tools like those integrated in visual studio or resharper rely on static type analysis for providing assistance while as generics usually add more type information to your object there is more information for such tools to analyse and to help you a conceptual generics help you solving concerns independently from your application regardless whether you are developing a financial application or a book you will sooner or later need to maintain collections of be it books or the implementation of such collections usually needs to know little to nothing about the things to be maintained in those the generic collections shipped with the framework are a primary example for a generics use

my and depending on your a one on one translation is not really the right approach to go consider why you want to move to and evaluate whether you really want to commit to a powerful but quite a steep learning curve and to be really worth it you need to take the time to look at the user experience and see how wpf can if you want to have the winforms look and and just move to wpf because the next new in for an unpleasant what done while migrating our winforms stuff is to make new screens in and keep hosting the old winforms screen using and these work really well by the way we had any problems with them so we then migrated screen by screen to looked like a frankenstein in the mean but at least we had regular feedback and everything was

my the primary value of stored procedures has been eliminated with for a long the key value of using stored procedures was to encapsulate the sql in a form where you would naturally use parameterized this provided a layer of security to the developer with respect to sql since linqtosql queries by parameterized i find that my use of stored procedures has been reduced not to say that there still a place for but now i feel that you should only use them when they provide significant value over a parameterized linq query in terms of less complexity or increased perhaps because of the ability to optimize for the removing over dependence on stored i results in a more maintainable code base as most of the code is located in your ide instead of being split between your database and your that you can still use stored procedures with i just find much value in doing i think of a single stored procedure that written since switching to though i have written a few functions to perform specific these get dropped onto my datacontext and appear as methods that i can invoke to get the appropriate entities from the db using the

namespaces were not intended to be a design mechanism they are there simply to prevent name you really want or need to use nested namespaces in of good example of the correct use of namespaces in is the standard everything in this quite large library is placed in a single namespace called there is no attempt or need to break the library up into an a math a container basic tool for modelling in is the class to some extent the not the if you feel the need for you should consider using nested which have the following advantages over have can control cannot be considered if you still wish to use nested namespaces by all means do so there is nothing technically wrong with using them in this

need some framework that will help me to do asynchronous streaming over it may look like soap ws or somethign i know if i name it so here is what i wants to make a request to remote serverb over the request contains arbitrary result for it is going to contain multiple records of the same some of them are available other are available servera wants to get available results as soon as without waiting until all results are in real world serverb will search across different data some of which are more responsive that can think of 3 kinds of servera generates random id of performs soap request will return and then a periodically calls servera polls serverb fore new i call this method it involves multiple connections established from a to another solution is to expose receiving service on servera like call serverb pushes new results to when new results are i call it it involves 1 connection established from a to b and multiple connection established from b to option is to stream results over same http within single performs http call know if it can be soap or should be something b starts searching and when new results are it sends them over http stream and flushes so they may be available on the a side it does not close http connection until all results are it involves only single connection from a to thats why i would prefer to use i call it i understand that it may not work if some proxy is on the way that buffers the response my question is if there is any solution that will do most of the work for what like to do is call such code on a s new or or r new callback new void e should be null if finished void implement it on serverb serviceimpl implements void callback perform call when new results are the rest is handled by including reestablishing connection when it is falling to if streaming can not be done because of buffering calling when serverb finishes work or throws the probbaly it should also handle authentication in some standard is there any solution that abstracts the way commuinication is and is capabale of streaming when there is do you think it would be useful to implement it as open web service

not possible to return the values without storing the results of the original function random number generator tells you to return these values from the original you skip the first four return the skip another return the 11th now how do you return the 3rd without saving it closest thing you could get away with is creating a list and append all the values which you skip but that sound very awkward and probably not worth the it would be very slow in the case where the shuffling algorithm returns a very big and then a very small value which case you would effectively copy most values into the which you want to rest my

not really sure i totally understand your what i think you are trying to say is that when you drag a supposed to be binding a click event listener to the button on your portlet so that when clicked a dialog pops you are saying that when you click on that a dialog pops up for your portlets and not just the one you clicked the button inside the it may be that you are binding that wrench multiple times so that when its it will act as if its clicked more than the only recommendation i have for you is that instead of using the method use the is what i do do stuff this instead and see if it makes any do stuff that let me know and i will see if i can help you so i think i might understand your problem when that wrench gets it brings up a dialog and in that dialog you are allowed to make changes to a certain you know how to let the dialog box know what portlet it should be affecting on on that you can do something like var some of your stuff var var do stuff with for or whatever you wanted to the rest of your buttons and your

not sure i am fully but when you create an event you can say that it bubbles and so when it dispatches it will believe that would allow you to attach an event listener to your city for the right types of events and that would catch events thrown by i ever tried this though so i am not i realize you are from the following and bubbling happen as the event object moves from node to node in the display for capturing and for this process has nothing to do with the inheritance only displayobject objects objects such as containers and can have a capturing phase and a bubbling phase in addition to the targeting only way i can see around this would be for you to register the child with the parent car with the every time a new one is added as a at that point you could add an event listener in the parent and then an event from the parent any time a event is handled from the child its ugly i and you would want to make sure you remove the event listener anytime that you remove a but the only real solution i can

not sure if the but when i did this put it in a i expected the user to preview and the data during just single session so the session was enough for you want you preview to persist on your users machine you should use a cookie that means the user have to the preview during single but can close the browser between this and than return back to the preview in next using this you have to consider that user can deny cookies in his why people usually combine sessions with cookies the data in a database a status is not necessary unless you want to track and store the previews and edit operations you can imagine the database as a drawer in your table you put there papers with whatever you want to store and find if just drawing a preview and after the result is only a final version is stored in a and the preview is crumpled and thrown than you put this in but if for some reason you think you will later go through the then they have to be stored in a not sure if clear with my but i did my best

not sure what you are worried from where i sit i can see three things your question can be related you may want to prevent unauthorized users from making a valid this is resolve by using the cookie to store a session the session id needs to tied to the be regenerated every time the user goes through the login process and must have an inactivity anybody request coming in without a valid session id you simply you may want to prevent a third party from doing a replay attacks against your site sniffing an inocent traffic and then sending the same calls the easy solution is to go over https for the ssl layer will prevent somebody from replaying any part of the this comes at a cost on the server side so you want to make sure that you really cannot take that you may want to prevent somebody from using your api what ajax calls are in the to implement his own client to your for this there is very little you can you can always look for the appropriate but easy to fake and will be probably the first thing somebody trying to use your api will think you can always implement some for example looking at the average ajax requests per minute on a per user basis and see if some user are way above your hard to implement and only usefull if you are trying to prevent automated clients reacting faster than human	
	
not sure what you mean with internet there is no other way to connect a client to the internet than using an the internet is a set of machines that has different tasks and your isp provides you with routing and bandwidth so you are able to connect to other i say what you can for example you spoof your ip address by sending packets with another ip but this is by it has to do with how traffic are not an active the router expects you to have your assigned ip and understand any other route and ping are using icmp to explore the read more about on icmp is not used by some routers for security or performance nat is also invisible to and domain lookup etc is using databases that store information about host a good article on wikipedia about use wireshark and go to a domain you visited before to see dns in domain lookups is useful to learn if domains looks valid for example trust an internet bank with an hotmail address as its contact scans for services and non filtered ports by using different kinds of port sniffing some hosts will automatically block you if you as port sniffing are usually used by hackers to find exploitable port scanning yourself is an excellent way to test your security and find

not sure why of the answers mention reflection good polymorphism works just fine for getting the runtime type name is easy just only somewhat tricky part is maintaining unique counters per been discussed before on so but i find a link the bottom is that you can either generics or maintain a to keep generic version works because each different type parameter creates a different generic class so they each have different static class where t private static int counter private static object synclock new protected lock public string name get return private string blur sharpen no need to override anything in the derived but you do have to make sure your inherited is correct or share i also used a lock to synchronize access to counter assuming create instances from more than 1 you like the generic then a works just as class command private static counter new private static object synclock new protected type t lock if public string name get return private string blur command sharpen command be creating of probably profile both and check memory i particularly care for the generic approach since easy to screw up and pass the wrong type parameter but i suspect memory usage is a bit if going to create have to worry about that being not sure why you just maintain an index addressable collection and reference them by index like

of much gratitude to for their very informative blog post scrolling in tweetie with the post explains in detail how the developers were able to squeeze as much scrolling performance as possible out of the uitableviews in with the source code linked from the blog post github a uitableview using these custom cells to switch to edit exposing the ui for deleting an item from the the text aside as the deletion control slides in from the this is although the text jumps back and forth without animation to the text movement in goal 2 above for a smooth user this is the step where i became is the best way to introduce this animation to complete goal it would be nice if this could be done in a manner that keeps the logic from my because i would love the option to move the conflicting part of the view while any portions as stay in the same place or move a different number of if the above is not possible then undoing my last commit and replacing it with an option that slides the entire view to the right would be a workable solution appreciate any help anyone can from quick pointers and ideas all the way to code snippets or github of course you are welcome to fork if you would i will be staying involved with this question to make sure any successful resolution is committed to github and fully documented thanks very much for your have been thinking about this a lot since my first post and realized that moving some text items relative to others in the view could undo some of the original performance goals solved in the original blog so at this point i am thinking a solution where the entire single subview is animated to its new postion may be the best if it is done in this way there may be an instance where the subview has a custom color or gradient hopefully this can be done in a way that in its normal position the background extends unseen off to the left enough so that when the view is slid to the right the custom background is still visible across the entire uitableviewcell when entering edit

of the asynchronous callback stuff still has me and sure just because i know javascript well the code down as much as this is where i create an empty div with an id of i can fill it with the results of a page method like boil the ajax error down to err display the specific error raised by the server unorderd list with the tag was just inserted into the div works it the and it gives me full control of error when i try to expand i get into if i have several areas of the page that i want to i can alter the call so that each async call is made with the correct but i tell the callback the id of the control that i want it to my case down to something that is still there are 4 divs in the dom that with and queuediv4 that i want to would like to reuse as much code as the number and of divs to be updated will actually be i thought this would have var divname data would be populated differently so that each div gets its own for now it matter boil the ajax error down to err display the specific error raised by the server this ever work since by the time success is called the scope is wrong and the divname already equals for every only that div gets updated is there a way to pass a variable to the or am i just thinking about the problem did find something like this dealing with async calls to site talked about wrapping the callback inside another anonymous function to preserve the calling that sort of made sense for scope but i have no idea how to form that the way the call is pageloads how do you pass parameters to

of the great things about web development is that most when you see a site and think did they do very easy to look at the code and find and also to test it out tools like for the developer tools in ie 8 and chrome will all display nicely formatted source and and will let you modify it in the case of the main body of the site is contained in a div with class of the style rules for 0 key thing looking at here is that this class has a width 950 and the margins are set to the left and right margins to has the affect of centering the div within the edges of and allowing them to expand to whatever width is needed once the container has taken up the required the container you then have a div with id style and then two and whose styles this is also set in the attribute left and right floats are positioning the bars in the right handy css rule can be set to or and will basically reset the floats on the it sounds like after what is often called the grail of points out that a bug in this with see for a for good three with at least one of them of completely flexible layouts layouts climb out of the

of the social networking sites like twitter use an rdbms at all but a message queue a lot of them start out with a already present application like some of them get big enough they have to heavily customize or build their twitter is in the process of doing this for the second message queue application works by holding messages from one service for one or more other for instance say service frank is publishing messages to a queue joe and jill are subscribed to franks foo the application will keep track of whether or not joe or jill have recieved the messages and once every subscriber to the queue has recieved the message it discards frank fires messages and forgets about joe and jill ask for messages from foo and get whatever messages they gotten joe and jill do whatever they need to do with the perhaps keeping it around perhaps message queue application guarantees that everyone who is supposed to get the message can and will get the message when they request the publisher can send the messages confident that subscriber can get them this has the benefit of being completely asynchronous and not requiring costly i should mention also that usually the storage for these kind of things at high scale are heavily so joe and jill may be storing a copy of the exact same this is considered ok because it helps the application scale to billions of

only safe way to deal with this is to ensure that you do not have a loss of conversion at the assert code will only work during debug builds and will allow for a conversion loss in retail the conversion loss is bad because it will pass around a completely incorrect size for the you really need is a mechanism to prevent you from creating data i reccomend using a class like this will prevent a conversion which overflows or underflows by means of throwing an size throws if size fit in an unsigned

originally used ruby on but been considered to be the cause of a lot of their downtime and so probably not the best last i heard they were transitioning a lot of their code to blaming ruby for their said to be abandoning ruby on	
	
originally wrote some code like char who is smarter than me said that having the initializer would zero out the my intention was to leave the memory i have time to discuss it but it piqued my i had thought it was wise to always list each member in the initializer someone please describe this behavior why does the initializer fill in does it only hold for pod i heard that it was but have the standard member initialization zeroes out	
	
orm framework will even get close to hand written sql in terms of although 100 queries seem unrealistic maybe you are exaggerating a even if you have the creator of the orm framework writing the it will always be far from the speed of good old advice look at the whole picture not only the framework improves code your team comfortable with writing sql and mixing it with you really understand how to optimize the framework think a for each object is not the optimal way of retrieving the queries of the framework present a never developed anything with but i think that you could mix both approaches and plain maybe after a of the app you can determine the real bottlenecks and replace that orm code for hand written sql in ruby you use then you profile the application with something as new relic and finally if you have a complicated ar query you replace that for some	
	
orm frameworks for do you like are you currently using for data choosing an is linq to sql or linq to entities better than choice for an size would you recommend for a large entity framework or what do you consider to be the advantages and disadvantages specific to both framework vs	
	
orm or via a models a parent object also notice a collection of children on the parent entity the entity retains a property representation of the foriegn key column this case which can also be assigned can be helpful if you only know the id of the parent of having loaded the parent entity via your no immediate drawback to use of direct assignment or via assignment of id as long as the id you are trying to assign belongs to a valid row in the parent	
	
orm some heavyweight orms can add a general drag to things but not talking orders of magnitude make orm slow is if using an orm because looks and you know how the underlying relational data model you can easily write code that seems reasonable to an oo but will murder is a handy but you need the understanding usually comes from writing sql to go with it you end up performing a looped query for each of thousands of entities at instead of a single fast then certainly it

other how do people work with just finished uploading my first project and it was far from being a straightforward anyway once the thing is up and running what would be a good cannot see how people could rely on the gitgui or command line for their professional development work or worse code straight into the browser but i am sure i am missing some thinghuge is there any client better than the enlighten are some standard setups people are using to work with	
	
other how does the implementation keeps track of the there a object maintained which is accessible by all the instances whose key is the address and value is the number of if to implement a this is the first idea coming to my there a possibility for a memory leak in case of these smart if how can i avoid does a smart reference counting	
	
other machine will need the framework one way or the you can bundle it with your you can have your installer detect it and download and install it if or you can just ask your users to install the framework through windows update if they have it the framework is on the in the simplest case simply a matter of copying the contents of the	
	
other responses are but for completeness just add by can only deduce template arguments automatically certain and this one of you think about realise that automatic deduction in this case would lead to an undesirable is not a real just a alias for a real type it might be to which it is immediately so the compiler would have to build some sort of in order to map back to for automatic deduction of to work but this mapping would break as soon as another class template was created that had a type member called that was to then the compiler would have two choices of what to translate and no way to choose between any automatic deduction policy that breaks when unrelated class adds a particular type is much too fragile to	
	
other solutions have been but i have to say the most straightforward to me is b if in string else	
	
other thing to consider for memory management is if you are implementing any observer patterns and not disposing of the references a watches object b is disposed if the reference from a to b is not disposed of property the gc will not properyly dispose of the becuase the event handler is still assigned the gc see it as a non utilized you have a small set of objects working with this may me if your working with thousands of objects this can cause a gradual increase in memory over the life of the are some great memory management software applications to monitor going on with the heap of your i found great benefit from utilizing memory	
	
other thought to add to the other excellent comments on this thread of which make sure that your management knows that unit testing is very highly automated at this i find it very impressive to pop nunit on the hit the button and see dozens of tests being passed in do that saying verifies that all of my older work is still correct despite all of my newer and you just may win a few in any come to trust you with your visible proof of quality more than they trust that can only be good for your	
	
others are is not the right way to do are some about why your attempt to use is only clearing for your sample that apparently is coincidentally the bytes occupied by the simple fix would be to write which in this case would set both and if your class has any virtual methods and the usual mechanism is used to represent them by your then that will destroy the and break the instance by setting the pointer to which is problem is that if the type requires some constructor action more complex than just settings its bits to then the constructors for the members are but their effect is ruined by overwriting the content of the members with only correct action is to write your default constructor to just forget about trying to use for this at pointed out in a comment that the default constructors for and were actually called before the in the original code as while technically calling overwrites the members which is at best really bad and at worst invokes the demons of undefined the class is as long as the type is also plain old data as would be the case if were or all it would take is for to be some sort of value class to cause problems that could be really hard to if you were they would manifest early through access violations from dereferencing the null pointers created by but lady luck is a fickle and the more likely outcome is that some memory is leaked and the application gets or more op asked in a comment on another answer there a way to make memset answer there is chosen the and chosen to take full advantage of you have to pay for those advantages by using the language it simply correct to bypass the constructor in the general while there are circumstances under which it is and sensible to call in a this just one of

others have rockwell is a websafe for am typing this on a perfectly ordinary windows box and have it is installed with certain versions of current accepted answer recommends using a proper css font stack to feed rockwell to visitors that have and fonts to those excellent so do you can actually do one all of the modern browsers either support css webfonts now or will in their next this module lets you host fonts on your server and transparently feed it to visitors when they allowing you to use a vast array of fonts that dependably go ahead and add webfont support now for giving it as the second choice in the font stack ordinary this will allow visitors who are using advanced browsers but have rockwell installed to still get the full effect of your while allowing visitors with lesser browsers to still gracefully degrade to another if you really need to hit ie with the go with image sifr is always an but it can really slow down a especially if you use a lot of the developer of which is an unobtrusive and image replacer that uses a php backend to generate the it grabs all relevant information from the css and can even handle there is also a fastcgi backend in development by one of my pir generates so it can deliver full transparency even make the font itself transparent if the visitor is using a browser that knows how to handle transparent

patterns are solutions for common what problems are you in consulting we see that often when someone sets out saying my what design patterns can i put to the architecture gets overly complicated very of looking for design patterns that you could possibly read up on design patterns to link to but does have a good list to get you started on other searches with at and then apply them when you come up with a problem that fits their far as having a lot of code in your window that may be appropriate for your or you may want to look at something like a loose mvc generally for gui a rigid mvc is going to be too and require too much work for separation of are many common problems that can be solved without design and that does not mean the solution is right or plugin for is very often given just by supplying a plugin interface or a set of events a plugin can respond you could look at the adapter	
	
patterns sounds a good choice to me as an you could do your configurable as lazy loaded or you could use a to achieve is configurable since it is only a should be automatically configurable so you may not have to do anything depending upon what may have to provide its own	
	
patterns work like algorithms for object oriented shows you how to put together objects in a meaningful relationship that performs a particular so i would say yes they reduce complexity by allowing you to understand the design of the software the same way with algorithms in procedural i told you that x was using a linked list with a bubble sort it would be a lot easier to following along with what the programmer was

people ask a question like i like to think to myself would happen if this were actually i really know what this would but i guess it would have something to do with being able to override the constructor implementation based on the dynamic type of the object being see a number of potential problems with for one the derived class will not be fully constructed at the time the virtual constructor is so there are potential issues with the what would happen in the case of multiple your virtual constructor would be called multiple times you would then need to have some way of know which one was being generally speaking at the time of the object does not have the virtual table fully this means it would require a large change to the language specification to allow for the fact that the dynamic type of the object would be known at construction this would then allow the base class constructor to maybe call other virtual functions at construction with a not fully constructed dynamic class as someone else has pointed out you can implement a kind of virtual constructor using static or type functions that basically do the same thing as a virtual constructor would

perfectly basically what you have done is very similar to a factory seems perfectly reasonable since your code seems to imply that every software object should have a pointer to its usually you can avoid to have classes like and just have static methods in since it seems likely that there will be only one something like this software whatever void static software return new static int static int return int you can just do course if you do plan on having more than one softwareproducer then what you have done seems

personally would always go with the two where clauses whenever it make the statement your it probably be noticeble at but having 2 where clauses definitely will have a performance impact if you have a large and if you use all of the results from this for if you call on the or iterate through the entire the first where clause will creating a new ienumerable that will be completely enumerated with a second the 2 clauses together causes the query to form a single delegate that gets run as the collection is this results in one enumeration through the collection and one call to the delegate each time a result is you split things as your first where clause enumerates through the original the second where clause enumerates this potentially 2 full enumerations through your collection and 2 delegates called per which could mean this statement could take 2x the runtime you do decide to use 2 where placing the more restrictive clause first will help quite a since the second where clause is only run on the elements that pass the first in your this on a large it as a general rule of i go readability and this i think both options are equally so go for the more performant

positioning in web layouts is to say the the part everyone knows about is the but what a lot of people realize the difference between two elements only comes in to play if at the same depth in the dom if the one that is higher in the tree closest to being directly under the will always be regardless of the in if you put your a tag higher in the it should take precedence over the maybe not in in certain elements know for sure selects do but video probably does always appear everything the common workaround for this is to use another one of those elements an as the background for your alternatively there are libraries as the bgiframe plugin for that will handle this sort of thing for none of that you also might just want to try hooking up an event handler to the a maybe even the video and then in that handler do to prevent the click from you could also do to prevent the default action of the movie but have to do that on the movie if you do it on the need to make the handler do since it will prevent the default action of the going to the one of those ideas works for

possible try using another profiler netbeans one works this may be hard to do depending on how your code is is possible just like many other a different profiler will result in different returning a local primitive really take longer than returning calculated an instance variable takes longer than returning an local variable the getter that you have is simple so it should be so it becomes as fast as accessing a public instance variable is slower than accessing a local you have a local value meaning in the method as opposed to in the exactly do you mean by i look at metric other than base have not used the eclipse so i am not sure how it it might make a difference if it is a tracing or a sampling profiler two can give different results for things like these results misleading and i need to consider some profiling would consider another just to see if the result is the based on it is a sampling profiler what that every the program is sampled to see where the program if you are calling the one method way more than the other it will show up as being in the method that is called more is simply more likely that that method is being tracing profiler adds code to your program process known as to essentially log what is going profilers are slower but more they also require that the program be changed instrumentation which could potentially introduce bugs that i have heard of it but i am sure it does at least while they are developing the profilers are faster but less accurate just guess at how often a line of code is if eclipse uses a sampling profiler you could see what you consider to be strange changing to a tracing profiler would show more accurate eclipse uses a tracing profiler then chaning profilers should show the same result they new profiler may make it more obvious to you as to what is going

poster is you cannot return multiple values from a you do have a couple of a structure that contains multiple an instance of a output parameters the or a dictionary or pair as pros and cons here are often hard to figure if you return a make sure small because structs are value type and passed on the if you return an instance of a there are some design patterns here that you might want to use to avoid causing problems members of classes can be modified because passes objects by reference have byval like you did in you can use output parameters but i would limit the use of this to scenarios when you only have a couple 3 or of parameters otherwise things get ugly and hard to the use of output parameters can be an inhibitor to agility because your method signature will have to change every time you need to add something to the return value whereas returning a struct or class instance you can add members without modifying the method an architectural standpoint i would recommend against using pairs or i find this style of coding requires in code that consumes the it must know ahead of time what the keys are going to be and what the values mean and if the developer working on the internal implementation changes the way the dictionary or kvp is it could easily create a failure cascade throughout the entire

practice found very helpful is the idea of making your test suite to the code being that means that the tests are arranged in the same order as the lines of code they are this makes it very easy to take a piece of code and the test suite for that look at them and step through each line of code to verify there is an appropriate i have also found that the mere act of enforcing isomorphism like this forces me to think carefully about the code being such as ensuring that all the possible branches in the code are exercised by or that all the loop conditions are given code like cacheinfo if mcacheinfo test suite for this function would have the following in	
	
practices for speeing up your web from yahoo includes the following users request a it can take anywhere from 200 to 500ms for the backend server to stitch together the html during this the browser is idle as it waits for the data to in php you have the function it allows you to send your partially ready html response to the browser so that the browser can start fetching components while your backend is busy with the rest of the html the benefit is mainly seen on busy backends or light good place to consider flushing is right after the head because the html for the head is usually easier to produce and it allows you to include any css and javascript files for the browser to start fetching in parallel while the backend is still js content the point at which the flush occurs here is after the head tag is this makes a lot of sense so the browser can begin loading images and scripts while the remainder of the page is rendered and there a way to flush after the head any other part of the explicitly using i flush the buffer early using

precision for a value is around 7 digits after the decimal which means the value you are adding is essentially at least when added to the value can effortlessly stored in a float since the exponent is small in that but to successfully add it to you have to use the exponent of the larger number and then the digits after the zeroes disappear in can use if you need more this make a difference on hardware and memory is often also not as constrained that you have to think about every single as you stated that using is not an option you could use as pointed out in a option may be to perform intermediary calculations in and afterwards cast to this will only when there are a few more operations than just adding a very small number to a larger

problem i have is have a table an with the following have a method called which does the int value value value i want to avoid is the following a calls method and gets the value b calls method and gets the value a increases value by 5 b increases value by 5 a saves value b saves value the record has a value of 10 when it should have been i want to force is the a calls method and gets the value b calls method but has to wait because a already called a increases the value b is still a saves the value has value of b can now read the value b increases the value b saves the the record has a value of which is the outcome looking solved this problem in the past using a static class and putting a lock on a static object created within the constructor of that thus funneling all the work through one static which forces other calls to wait in afraid however that this also think that the the highest isolation level for a transaction do the trick either because it will allow the read in step 2 of the unwanted example suppose another solution would be to create my own lock table and record the locks but that seems like it be developing this project with and sql server does the hive mind dibs on a table

problem is generally a one in terms of computational in fact it rings some bells in the back of my head that it probably reduces to one of those classic algorithm problems like the but i attach a proper name to with such a small problem space can only pick 10 it should be fairly quick to just the when someone submits a custom just recursively attack it with all possibilities and see which one is the take the components and first try to remove the components of from if take the remaining components and try to take the components of from keep track of the best solution found so far as you go still not fast enough i think it probably will depending on how many packages you you could apply some methods to speed it to on the number of possibilities and how long this actually takes to you may want to write the code i described and then just go ahead and all the solutions for every possible then when someone submits a custom you just have to fetch the answer instead of computing it from scratch every if you want to them suggest storing the result every time someone does a custom then in the future if anyone else does the same custom build you have to recalculate the	
	
problem is i have a simple block image that i want to make a grid out i have created an array of cgpoints in my then i used then for j 0 j for i 0 i touchx and touchy are the cgpoints where the user has touched the so basically displaying a different image at the point on the grid where the user of the problem is that the whole screen is redrawn every time i call i want to be able to save the state changing an array of and have the user drag on the screen and change multiple unable to use the method on the uimage when outside of an i started looking into the coreanimation and quartz and got really not sure if i should be creating multiple uiviews for each brick or a grid of calayers or i think pretty simple what i want to but i really understand and the difference between using a calayer and a apparently uiviews are layer what does that kind of lost on how to implement i basically want to swap images in the grid so that the user can essentially across the screen and toggle the tried implementing this using and passing in the cgrect that is under the this is still calling drawrect within which is giving me the effect i but is way too slow on the is there a more efficient way to accomplish the same effect using new to core animation and really understand how to use a layer to solve this a grid of images using core graphics in

problem is that using to represent the type of the this is the values are actually normal 32 bit values on should only be used for values which change size based on the 32 or 64 of the platform as change the code to use int or and this should fix your reason this works fine on win32 is that is a different sized type depending on the for 32 bit windows it will be 32 bits and on 64 bit windows it will be 64 so on 32 bit windows it just happens to match the size of the data type you are	
	
problem is that you have a route that matches the route values action have two one is the empty string which matches controller action the other is your hash which matches controller action when routing goes to build a url from the route values it find one none of them have the and simplest in this is to create a direct route to the so that you can still use your put this at the top of your registerroutes order routing checks each in the order until it finds a route url with new controller action parameter you have that you really use the default since the value would be consider a valid controller if someone mvc would look for a controller called and complain that it find this means you have to manually add new routes for each new controller action i showed which is a best solution my is to use regex if your hashes have a very format 5 letters followed by 2 or followed by any or if willing to impose such a you can use the regex constraints supported by only need these two new controller action new hash regex route url with new controller action parameter these if mvc sees a controller name it will check the first find that it match the regular and move to the next my regular expression syntax may be a bit so use something like to test a regex to make sure it works with your hashes and controller that i know i wrote a but mvc is so you can do things in so many different	
	
problem is that your template is going to be instantiated in more than one compilation unit as it is completely therefore in every compilation unit that uses the template you will end up creating one singleton compilation what you would need is to force global so that all compilation units reference the same template the upcoming standard will support this via what you can do now is to disable automatic instantiation in your project and manually instantiate the templates that you use this way when you use the template in any compilation unit you will generate an unknown reference to the implementation which can then be satisfied by the linker from the compilation unit where you do the explicit

processor has instructions that when a certain condition is met it and otherwise it continues on to the next a into register the zero flag is set register 0 contains then jump to complex conditions b become a sequence of instructions that leaves a register in a 0 or non zero so the branchif instruction can jump or not jump based on the conditional are many conditional flags and some branchif instructions also operate on more complex conditions it might actually check to see if a register is equal to another rather than simply looking at each architecture is different and makes tradeoffs so the instruction set is but also speedy and moocha points out in the some architectures allow you to apply a conditional to or even all so you might not only have but also x86 is very complex beyond this simple explanation once you get into out of order and all the other advanced for most purposes the above explanation is if writing a hand crafted very tightly wound have to take these things into account for maximum performance and a topic for another question	
	
production animators use specialized tools such as 3ds max to generate keyframed animations of 3d for each animation for each the animator constructs a number of poses for the model called the which are then exported out into the data game then loads these and to animate the model at a particular it picks the two nearest keyframes and interpolates between them to give a smooth even with a small number of models are typically constructed with a bone there is a root which controls the location and orientation within the game all of the other bones are defined relative to some parent bone to create a each vertex of the model is tied to a particular so the model can be controlled with a much smaller number of the relative and scales of each skinning is a technique used to improve the quality of with smooth a vertex is not tied to just one but it can be tied to multiple bones a hard such as is vertices rarely need more than with corresponding this makes the job since he has to do a lot more work with vertices near but the result is a much smoother animation with less distortion around the some games use whereby the animation data is constructed at the bone positions and orientations are computed according to some such as or other options are of course but they must be coded by of procedurally animating the bones and using forward kinematics to determine the locations of all of the another option is to just procedurally generate the position of each vertex on its this allows for more complex animations that bound by bone but of course much more complicated and much harder to do

provide an abstraction layer for your domain you can therefore change the model and not break the contract you have for your service this is akin to a common practice in database design where views and procedures become the abstraction layer for the underlying data you may over expose data and send bloated messages over the this may be mitigated by using serialization but you may still have extra explicit contracts by exposing domain objects you leave it up to the client to interpret their usage since they do not have the full model at their you will often make updates to domain objects implicitly based on the presence or removal of or blindly accept all dtos explicitly express the usage of the service and the desired scenarios having explicit messages or dtos would make it easier for you to implement messaging and messaging patterns such as message pure ddd demands that domain objects are externally and therefore you must offload this to another typically a

put it the other way you might be risking overcomplicating something that is ridiculously simple being a bit as others are pointing is really just a minimal set of language extensions to when you are writing you are actually writing you can even access the internal machinations of the runtime support using some handy c functions that are part of the language i recommend you actually do this unless you really know what the only time ever had mildly tricky moments is when i wanted to pass an instance method as a callback to a c for using a cross platform library that has functions which accept a i might call the function from within an object instance to process some and then want that c function to call my instance back when its or as part of getting additional input etc etc common paradigm in this can be done with funky function and some other creative methods and if you ever need to do it googling method for c or something like that will give you the only other word of advice is to make sure your objects appropriately manage any manually memory that they create for use by c want your classes to tidy up that memory on dealloc it is than dust off any reference on c and have

question follows on very closely to one i asked earlier but i do not think they are the same thing so thought it was sensible to split them up is a little ironic when you hear the have a web application that was split into two the dll that contained the busines logic layer methods and dal they where split into different namespaces but all within the same more i looked at it and extended the development the more i realized i was very much going down the wrong i wanted to split them up into separate so that i could have a clear separation of i had the code in different i realized that a lot of classes called each for example when a list of client objects were created in the dal it would also call the and get a list of companies that the clients belonged so i now had two classes that directly referenced each this seems like a rather bad it smelt bad but i carried on and tried to separate things out where i that end i took all the objects out to interfaces and changed all references to them to the was hoping to use some sort of di learning about that at the so for each object i created a constructor that took in a factory for that factory would create a new instance of each object that the class might i also put a default constructor in that would call the di constructor with a default factory to ensure that there was always one factory all compiled so i gave it a spin and got a this is were i fully realized that if i have two classes that require each other you can not instantiate without the iclient return new icompany return new private icompany public this public public client do stuff to get client from got client object and companyid from return private iclient public this public public company do stuff to get a company out and client for each client id return i going about the di thing all is it that factory idea should i avoid the classes needed each the reason they are like that at the moment is to avoid repeated i am sure i could write cleaner sql to get it all out in one or at least in a couple of queries in the same but i was trying to avoid repeating code in different for any and all design with

quick the stl and boost headers do indeed belong in the precompiled header even though these header files define template generating a precompiled header a compiler parses the header text significant and converts it into a binary format that is optimised for the though the template classes will be instantiated when other files are they will be instantiated from information in the precompiled which is significantly faster for the compiler to thing that you should include in a precompiled header are files that are part of your project and are changed even if every single file includes these reason is this the generation of the precompiled header can take a long because the stl and windows libraries are very might have a simple file that everything if is included in and one developer touches then every developer has to wait until the precompiled it would be much faster if was left out of the precompiled and parsed along with each

read that it will only make you read this book the definitive the maven site has a lot of but the structure is terrible so need to use google to navigate in is my this by not with from the maven integration work that good not in any sure you program project is divided into modules under a common umbrella so that each module produces a single binary artifact possibly accompanied by the javadoc of the source code behind that a zip with the source code the basic principle is that each module produces a single containing all the under that you can do this while the project is still built by module should conform to the standard maven directory the build destination is under the source code is under and the artifact consists of all the code under and none of the code under as it built to the target you can do this while the is still built by by transforming the that has no dependencies on other modules in the you can create the parent maven module with artifact type consisting of one of the modules make a child module for the first submodule one with only external using the umbrella module as remember that you need to specify version for the remember to add the child module as a in the parent always use as version in the child modules when you create projects like all modules under a parent must be released simultaneously in a single and if you use this setting maven will make sure the version fields stay the same across all modules and gets updated everywhere during the this may make it difficult to the existing numbering but that you are never going to run out of version numbers the necessary and make sure you can build the parent and the child module together using the command clean from the parent with the rest of the modules the same dependencies to other modules under the same parent project should also use as the they are depending meaning same version as note that in order to the module you are depending on must be built using so that it gets deployed to you local otherwise the depending module will not be able to find the there are no dependencies between modules in only dependencies to built and packed versions installed in local and remote this can be very confusing if you come from build from the root module until you get comfortable with it takes two use maven integration in it is a bad use or to set up your workspace as a ordinary ide the dependencies mechanisms in maven and the ide identical and will never if you have several mavenized projects with dependencies in you want to have several of these in your workspace with dependencies set up you can do this with mvn if you create a separate maven project file called in the same directory as parent set up as a project containing modules and reference no parent ref if you run you get a workspace with all these modules linked no ide integration lets you do this sound like a lot of extra but the is really it have to contain all that dependency stuff and all only the reference to the modules you want to bind together in your

readers generally expect in a very specific you can use this yourself using s when you are using something have to read it as a string and use to specify the actual format s when you are using you could use a shim property to do the conversion let me know if this is what you are	
	
reading a book that describes the syncroot it compares to the syncroot syncroot new i really understand the difference it seems that in both cases both methods can only be accessed by one thread at a book describes because the object of the instance can also be used for synchronized access from the outside and you control this form the class you can use the syncroot of the anyone tell me the difference between the two approaches in the use of the syncroot

reading charlie i was curious about whether the heap size makes any difference in the number of threads you can and i was totally dumbfounded by the jdk on vista home premium i executed test application with different heap between 2 mb and 1024 to create a 2 mb invoke the jvm with the arguments are my mb 5744 mb 5743 mb 5735 mb 5724 mb 5712 mb 5687 mb 5662 mb 5610 mb 5561 mb 5457 mb 5357 mb 5190 mb 5014 mb 4606 mb 4202 mb 3388 mb 2583 the heap size definitely but the relationship between heap size and maximum thread count is inversely is

real issue is that does not provide 2d or 3d rendering primitives or any sort of sound without a lot of the stuff we expect out of desktop apps thinking of image and video real time that sort of you can do these things just not with open with a little more and more of the rich functionality available with and javafx will get pushed into and the barriers will be completely see any reason of apps run in a browser in a few	
	
real methodology but i think 2 things are well defined goals each the last say in how part should be open source projects the only real and strongest motivation is the fun to be had coding the relating to if people are told what to and they agree with the motivation starts of course there will always be a bit of like in any other type of about the face skype is great for having face to face which i recommend at least once a week or month on the size and momentum of the	
	
realize most languages support multiple but every language seen has always been by i mean the standard library all have english as a you still really need to know at least some english to make sense of there any truly languages out there with support for language keywords and such in multiple programming

realize that this answer your but i really understand why there need to be studies on this sort of the implications of either setup are pretty especially if ever worked in each type of a bullpen or cubicle communication between team members is going to be maximized but going to be difficult for anyone to be maintain their focus and maximizing communication in this manner is a double edged good because everyone will know going on and contribute to technical conversations they eavesdrop but bad because everyone is going to get sucked into conversations closed door people have to work harder at keeping communication channels open but much easier to maintain focus and concentration on worked in both types of i much prefer closed door a closed door office gives me the choice of whether to be involved in communication or be able to sit and setups do not give me that even with headphones i sometimes find it very difficult to concentrate when a conversation going on think the ideal setup would be to have a common area where people can do work in a shared environment if not doing anything that requires a great deal of concentration along with closed door offices for when people need to make phone calls or concentrate without i think the reality is that no company is going to pay for that extra

really believe that this information is in the next version of the os 2008 microsoft is introducing the ability to do this by implementing a recycle bin like functionality for and active directory please see these write ups for more you may see that this is in reference to the deletion of the object and that it provide any information about when a property of the object you can look at the last modified property but even then you have no way of knowing which property changed then likely it will be the last so again your left with no if your trying to track a issue that is occurring which you can i recommend that create some sort of which record the properties of a specific user at a given and then just keep running it as you move from one step to the other i the recreation of the	
	
really depends on the goal of your course teaching programming and teaching computer science are two separate and though they are not mutually introductory classes generally do not teach both equally an example of the say we want to learn how to sort a a programming course in would teach you to use the syntax of a function and homework might be writing several comparison a computer science course would explain to you what a merge sort what the algorithm looks like in and its and homework would be writing the sort function if you are teaching introductory then you should teach your students about you are teaching computer then there is no need to understand pointers at an introductory	
	
really depends on what the requirements are of the as well as your concern regarding two applications run inside the same application pool they have the same security so there is a security concern here for some as in theory each could have access to files of the if one site starts having issues and using memory it could cause recycles or freezes that could impact there is not a and rule to some of the things that i consider and that cause decisions for me are the the application mission separate app this a third party and unsure of what all it separate app this application see major spikes in it might be best to is a lot out but the keys are isolation and ability to troubleshoot single here is a that touches on it a bit as

really hope someone can help with this i have an ajax pagination script that works great on the first page but the click events will not work on any other pages from the is how i have it prepare when the dom is ready height and width of the message var height var width offset for displaying popup the popup message and hide with fading div on mouse should popup a div with content from another my works great on the initial page but the problem now is when i click to visit page 2 which has the exact same the link work a my pages should load in a div with the ajax paging itself works its just that any jquery click event on the resulting pages does not i think the problem may be that i need to rebind the script but i do not know how to accomplish for any help on event does not work after ajax	
	
really is this your personal repo or is it a repo that is shared by many how far into the project are i commit to my subversion repositories when i am done with one aspect and everything it does not have to be just not i prefer to not leave things broken in the first written code can get checked but only in my personal generally with notes about what i was doing at the time and what still needs to get since i use subversion and this is my personal repo i use this mainly to be able to leave my desktop and pick back up where i left off on my the one per commit is but may not suit your development if this is a more complete project it may work out since commits mean that you are crossing items off a list somewhere and it means one more item that is now things to what is significant about the changes that it warrants checking for i checked in code last night that significantly changed an internal this meant i had to document the changes in the commit message as well as the at the same time i also changed a few comments to fix that gets a small on the commit but is not something i consider a big enough issue to get committed on its	
	
really like the idea looping through all the controls in form the form to the event i ask why could write a function that takes a delegate and a list of types as an which will have exactly the same effect as your handleevent

really meant for this conditional compilation and it honestly sounds like a recipe for ending up in you could manually start dealing with functions that return the version of your you then have a classfile that fits a specific but with no indications that it may be encountered this situation before working with different versions of and not what i ended up doing is having an interface with two different one for each put each of them in a separate project in my and then tried to load them with a factory or an isolate them as well as you	
	
really opposed to merely you can download the source and run it yourself it the original provider goes of want to download the source ahead of because if the service provider goes not guarantee that there will be a site to download it probably want to keep backups of the data for yourself if you if misusing the term to mean a free service like the google maps then if it goes but if google maps goes so is half the	
	
really pass custom parameters to the however the following things are possible and could solve your features can be enabled using standard features can be disabled using this requires can use environment these however require to be on windows whereas prefixing them works on os x python can extend distutils with your own which can implement new they are also so you can use that to change variables in your foo will execute the command before it executes that helps generally speaking i would suggest providing a bit more information what exactly your extra parameter should maybe there is a better solution	
	
really see the a school thing you need to keep track of the you should have a local representation of each client client object on your it can take care of whatever things you need to that case you need to be able to find out from which client the message was sent information from the you can keep the clients in a most effective way is probably to do all handling in the main unless whatever that needs to be done can waiting for external events if some things supposed to happen might take a long time and some a very class client public void do stuff client object can perhaps start a new thread in if start multiple server server thread can client there are no things to care just read the messages and handle them as they in one	
	
really should never be considered as a legal really about doing the right looking at the legal side of first think common sense and politeness to the original legal aspect should really come as a second the work resulting from your under the gpl would certainly be the best way to handle javascript software you are using as a starting point was to you by its author under the and the best way to thank for the gift is to give your own contribution under the gpl if for some reason the gpl is not possible for then you really have two the original author and get approval for your and the license you want to use on your own the original copyright holder could even allow you to either make a proprietary derivative of this original work or to license it under both gpl and another license of your choice to any gpl restriction you may not start from that and create your own php software independently from the javascript implementation but the idea learned from reading the javascript ideas from gpl code is a valid way to thank the original author whatever license you

really the answer to your but in many real world applications are written in a higher language using the idioms common to that and only use a bit of assembly language where performance or hardware needs this is probably the only sensible approach for real because assembly language just as productive as other in terms of getting the computer to do more for each hour spent programming being all of the tools and techniques for managing a project in any other language apply equally to assembly source project meaningful names for separation of object oriented design patterns can have object oriented design without an object oriented all apply equally to assembly language as it does to or	
	
really trust large number of questions on regarding whether this method or that method is belie the fact in the vast majority of code spends most of its time sitting around waiting for users to do really profile it for i think most likely find that only in the most intense work does this question the difference may well be only a couple of seconds and even only when processing huge numbers of your code working then get it working only if you find an actual performance spent optimising before finished the functionality and can properly is mostly wasted

reason being that i suspect most people are taught to implement it using a class and a the following haskell sortby compare sortby sortby the strategy pattern in and are the concrete strategies in this case plain old and the function signature a is the strategy brevity of this illustrates that design patterns have to be so heavyweight or the way you want to implement strategy in java is a good a way that works around java giving you the wrong abstractions for the job you need to this should be considered normal or that assuming my assumption about the way taught is i like the strategy pattern very are some of other patterns which are also specific instances of the general i like them very much for very much the same	
	
reason for this could be that merging only to the root limits the number of properties that are going to be set on the in your	
	
reason is that and are not numbers in the awk the indexes are so if you want the the first one is the second one is that this is different with the lines with	
	
reason it has to be in should generally work i think i done java stored procedures for a long time you should just be able to open an io stream as you always would in	
	
reason that it giving you what you expected is like peter said the should read reason that the result is saying that they appear to be equal is because with the format that given it month is it is taking 28 adding a 16 adding another and the result is 4 and the year is now same thing for	
	
reason this is happening is because in order for to restored posted those controls need to be a part of the page before in order to make this work you need to create your controls oninit of the	
	
reason why it is probably coming back is due to the fact that we know have screens with high enough refreshrate so that 3d is i think i read that you will need somewhere around 100hz for no need for bulky glasses to you no longer need glasses in order to have 3d this article was posted in a swedish magazine a few weeks it says is basically that instead of glasses you use a technique with vertical lenses on the problem with crt is that they are not our more modern flat screens obviously got this second problem is that you need high frequency least 100 hz as that makes the eye get 50 frames per and a lot of since each eye only gets half the sets that support 3d have been sold by various companies since	
	
reason why this happens is that when a plugin is invoked from the command line like it has no phase or execution associated with this means it picks up the unnamed execution which is the config outside the execution you really want to run multiple bind them to a phase and then invoke that in this case each execution will run with its own real unasked question here is why you are using to deploy a bunch of stuff like if 3rd party you should get a repo manager like and upload them once to a repository for your whole team to	
	
reason you are marking those links that be validated as opposed to those that it would be much easier the second but if you need to stick to this then the you could do something like is using the selector and only selecting links that have the class internally jquery has to get all the links in the page to see whether it has the class or which is not very you would just give a class to links that be then you can much	
	
reason you cannot pass is because a parameter is given special treatment by the any parameter must be a reference that can be passed to the function you are since you want to pass the compiler is refusing to allow this since you are not providing a reference that the function is expecting to only real option would be to create a local set it to and pass that the compiler will not allow you to do much more than	
	
reason you get that error is that the default constructor for a wcf client proxy looks up the channel configuration from local you can override this behavior by specifying the binding and address you want to use connect have several options each with a different deployment the endpoint information in your library common term for this is you would just return new for this only distribute the assembly your wsgateway code was in called a common configuration file that all sites have access if these are all services on the same this is easy to place configuration data in a shared common drive location and read it from if you want the full gamut of possible wcf configuration to be need to use the method and read it manually and apply it manually to your binding before your open the client for this you would ensure you centrally located config file was accessible and distribute you wsgateway your configuration to a common resource accessible from all like a this would allow you to access this configuration data from any point in your for this you would ensure your configuration database was accessible from all points in your solution and distribute your wsgateway are the solutions i could think of off the top of my let us know what you decide to

recent versions of sql execution plans are cached for stored procedures and parametrized the query will have a one time cost to create the execution but this will be very minor and lost in the overhead of even a few a performance perspective they will be almost exception to is if you are doing recursive or nested queries each row in query execute query where the round trips between the client and server will add in this a proc will be much companies still have as a but this is usually due to control of the database and not performance as linq grows in this may your application has a single points of then use whichever you on the other if you are deploying to many many then stored procs can in some not cases allow you to update database functionality without redeploying the client	
	
recently been building a test framework for a bit of been working i have nunit set up and a new project within my workspace to test the all works well if i load up my unit tests from nunit but got to the point where it would be really useful to run in debug mode and set some break tried the suggestions from several guides which all suggest changing the properties of the test external line using the console version but have tried the calling the gui as both give me the same error when i try and start start test project because the project does not contain any this because i normally load into the nunit gui and where the tests are beginning to think the problem may be that vs wants to run own test framework and why failing to find the nunit to those asking about test one of my files in the testdsp project looks roughly like testing framework using public class public void pretty new to and the nunit test framework so entirely possible missed some crucial bit of information the big problem was the project if you pick languages visual test test choosing the project visual studio will try and use own testing framework as far as i can you should pick a class library project instead and then the instructions in my selected answer will do i run nunit in debug mode from visual

recommendation is sending simple key name value pairs if you need to stick completely to an ascii text type the key name is used to describe the name of the field that each value conveys similar to original you can send data in a binary tagged format such as tagcodenum is perhaps a byte or word and length is a byte or word depending on your the idea of this format is that the receiver can recognize fields that it understands by the code number and then can also skip tags it know how to in this the encoding becomes if you need multiple tags grouped into logical i would wrap a group of these binary coded tags in an overall message the tag above is a replication of the previous tag construction described above and length describes the byte length of all the tags combined if you think about this not a whole lot different than an xml type structure but it is a lot more concise and constrained so that it is nearly trivial to

recommended way is through dom but it can be quite for para b do something with the para add it to the response to your in order to replace the current you simply remove the existing then use the code above to fill in new for somediv children i i as someone else recommend using something like jquery as not all browsers fully support and those that do have quirks which are dealt with internally by javascript for jquery looks something like	
	
recommended way is to define the environmental then tomcat will use this java order to load the endorsed create a put there and define the environmental variable to point at that is better than using the global endorsed because it affect the whole jvm and you have to repeat the when the jre is

relational database is not your best first choice for want all of your editors to pass changes to your player is effectively a server for all those your player needs multiple open it must listen to all those connections for it must display those the changes are really you can move to a hybrid solution where the editors persist the changes notify the the editors must notify they player that they have a much simpler than the player trying to discover changes in a better design is a server which accepts messages from the persists and notifies the this server is neither editor nor but merely a broker that assures that all the messages are it accepts connections from editors and it manages the are two server is the server is separate from the the design of server change only the when server is the then server calls the player objects when server is separate from the then the server writes to the the player is part of the player objects are invoked directly when a message is received from an when the player is a small reader collects the messages from a socket and calls the player player connects to the server and then waits for a stream of this can either be input from the editors or references to data that the server persisted in the your message traffic is small enough so that network latency is not a editor sends all the data to the if message traffic is too then the editor writes to a database and sends a message with just a database fk to the clarify the editor crashes while the player is permanently messed in your sounds like a poor design for the player it be messed unless not getting state from the various if getting state from the editors attempting to mirror that for then you should consider a design where the player simply gets state from the editor and cannot get messed

right about liskov substitution and right about in fact both telling you the same public methods are a with users of your class saying can call those methods on foo means that saying that a is always acceptable to use where a foo could be in it means you inherit not implementation can override or foo may be abstract and give no particular implementation for a of implementation is a what is the public the the to users that a bar can be used like a they may never even know they have a not a if i make a and i write its to return a pointer to a they may never have you break that you break object the java collection by throwing notsupported entirely break oo users can no longer use subclasses poor which has caused major headaches for many many java something to a public method that foo subclasses then that method be in it should be in a foo and the other subclasses should derive from that does not mean that all methods in foo should be callable on not contradicting methods are not part of a public you want a method in foo that be called on be publicly callable in then make that method private or

seeing is a bit of legacy code showing its the heart of the matter is the visual basic used the type for its boolean true for a is represented with the value which has the integer value during the conversion to it was decided that when using visual basic conversion routines to convert a boolean value to an integer visual basic semantics would be maintained on the return it would be first implicit conversion occurs with the b i under the hood this does an implicit conversion from integer to any value is deemed to be therefore the resulting value is the following line of code is doing an implicit conversion to an integer the hood this uses one of the visual basic conversion routines or to convert the value to an as such visual basic semantics are in play and the value returned is next interesting line is the this is using a conversion routine which does not use visual basic it returns the underlying representation for a true boolean value which is

short answer is the long answer is there any great classes exposed to manipulate rich text items in however a few that you can research are the and notesrichtexttable to name a these classes help you define some rich text elements and add them programmatically to your rich text since sending is to use the notesmimeentity classes and build the email using html way some sample s new docmail as body as stream as db false do not convert mime to rich email to be docmail send to from from reply to set stream body html code goes used because of technote found on docmail body stream true restore need to turn the convertmime setting off in the then create a new set the mail that part is already in your vba create the mimeentity and a stream to hold your html finally call the setcontentfromtext method on your mimeentity then send your note the last call is to turn the convertmime feature back on for the not sure if this will all work via but it does work well in lotusscript agents in hope this	
	
short answer is there is no way to lock down the people from a specific geographic location because you guarantee the location of a user that reliably using an ip even if you it can be faked through are ways to make it more difficult for people in a region to access the but the more restrictive you get with those approaches the more legitimate users you are likely to lock for turning off the server would give you assurance that no one from china could hit but it would also give you assurance that no one in the us could

short answer solving this in the app layer is the wrong ext4 must make sure that after i close the the data is written in a timely as it is ext4 this writing to be able to collect more write requests and burst them out in one problem is no matter what you you be sure that your data ends on the calling manually only makes things you basically get in the way of slowing the whole system ext4 has all the information necessary to make an educated guess when it is necessary to write data out to the in this i rename the temp file to the name of an existing for this means that it must either postpone the rename the data of the original file stays intact after a or it must flush at since it postpone the rename next process might want to see the new renaming implicitly means to flush and that flush must happen on the fs not the app might create a virtual copy of the filesystem which contains the changes while the disk is not modified but this affect the ultimate an app know what optimizations the fs if going to make and the fs must make sure that it does its is a case where ruthless optimizations have gone too far and ruined the golden optimization must never change the end if you maintain you must not long as tso believes that it is more important to have a fast fs rather than one which behaves i suggest not to upgrade to ext4 and close all bug reports about this is as designed by some more thoughts on you could use a database instead of the ignore the resource waste for a can anyone guarantee that the which the database become corrupted by a the database can write the data and call every minute or but you could do the do sync sleep 60 the bug in the fs prevents this from working in every people be so bothered by this could use a background config daemon like the windows the daemon would write all configs in one big it could call after writing everything problem solved for your now you need to do the same for everything else your apps text i mean almost any unix process creates a this is the freaking basis of the whole unix this is not a viable so the answer there is no solution on your keep bothering tso and the other fs developers until they fix their

should not generate an initialization vector from the secret the initialization vector should be unpredictable for a given if you generated it from the key a password used to generate a the iv will always be the which defeats its iv need to be quite common to send it with the incorporating the iv in the url is a lot easier than trying to keep track of the iv for a given link in some and ivs have distinct but they do act in similar is used in key derivation storing a hashed password for authentication is a special case of this salt causes the same password to yield different and thwarts where a hacker has hash values for common and built a index so that they can quickly discover a password for a given like an the salt used is not a initialization vector is used with block ciphers like des and aes in a feedback mode like each block is combined with the next block when it is for under the previous block cipher text is with the plain text of the current block before the iv is randomly generated to serve as a dummy initial block to bootstrap the a different iv is should at chosen for each when the same message is encrypted with the same the resulting cipher text is in that an iv is very similar to a a cryptographic random generator is usually the easiest and most secure source for a salt or an so they have that similarity is very easy to mess if you are not confident about what you are you should consider the value of the information you are and budget accordingly to get the training or consultation you	
	
should note that in some the half open connection one in the may not even be recorded on the implementations may use in which they encode all of the information they need to complete establishing the connection into the sequence number of the when the ack packet is with the sequence number they can decrement it and get the information this can help protect against syn floods by not allocating any resources on the server for these thus no matter how many extra syn packets a client the server will not run out of that implements a with cookies built into the to protect against syn floods while allowing more information to be stored in the and thus not having to limit the protocol features supported because the size of the cookie is too small you only get 32 bits of sequence number to store all of the to answer your the will only ever see fully established and will have no notion of the connections that are purely an implementation detail of the tcp

similar things would apply for other there are of things to is great for functional programming works well concurrently partly due to the emphasis on locks when you access mutable shared both for reads and try to go unless you really have locks are but rarely the should almost be part of a condition waiting for a condition to become true and waiting again if to avoid holding locks for longer than you need you ever need to acquire two locks at document the ordering thoroughly and make sure you always use the same the of your most types need to be they just need to not be thread hostile can use them from multiple but responsible for taking out locks if you want to share access the ui in documented from a in windows use off the top of my head i probably think of more if this is useful to but stop there in case

simple likely there is little or no but yes indeed the way you write a query can have a huge impact on sql server issues are very database a correlated subquery will usually have poor performance compared to doing the same thing in a join to a derived things in a query that can affect performance include using where clauses instead of selecting only the fields you need and never using select not when doing a join as at least one field is using a query instead of a avoiding using a wildcard as the first character in a a like clause and on and there are very large books that devote chapters to more efficient ways to write for those that are stage 1 predicates in db2 parlance possibly other stage 1 predicates are more efficient since parts of indexes and db2 uses those	
	
simple rule is if you are going to query the then it should be a discrete field within a table within the if you can store the blob and be done with if you want to derive from a and index then you can do that readily as your data types are congruent with what the database can support can be accurately there can be some value is exploding the blob in to its component parts that map nicely in to db problem with defining on the could be easily is not so much the definition of the but the potential change of the tables that are being changed a column or tend to be unusable for the duration of the not an issue for 100 a real problem for millions of the data definitions are fairly then creating a mapping facility that lets your users describe the and then you use that definition to both create a compliant table and convert the blobs appropriately during for the rows of different you can still stuff that data in to a single some rows have columns compared to each row is identified by if you have lots of row and lots of you get lots of wasted space doing then you may want to go to having a table for each row and a master table that holds the row types and references to the real rows in the actual you would only need this master table if you care about the relationships of the original data packets to each other you can store them in receipt it all boils down to how much data you how much you how much work you want to do vs how much you already have

small caveat up i have no idea about using or i think your milestones be set by the version control bug tracking milestones are just significant events in your they should be significant to all stake the completion of a major deliverable is a the completion of a few features sign off on all plans and contracts is a significant but the completion of 10 mockups tend to use the schedule and tasks for working with the tick tasks off as they are to everyone else i just report on are we going to make uat by may yes we milestones are tools for reporting to sponsors and other stakeholders you should set them to be what they think is my sponsors will want to know when a certain core set of features is so that is a want to know when uat is signed off so that is a too few milestones and no one will know how you are progressing until the set too many and the value will be is no magic but projects with hundreds of tasks and thousands of man hours may only have 4 a rough diagram of a schedule and this relate to trac and svn but hopefully this gives you a rough idea on how milestones are generally oh and apologies in advance for the overuse of comic

smart is garbage collection when it comes to nested this code for class private know that gc works by looking at how many references and any object without any references ends up getting so in this where a reference coming from a member is that a memory leak waiting to happen you implement now assuming that the gc is smart enough for since it could probably check to see if any references are coming from the object and just not count them towards the reference but i thought i would dig a nested

solution i liked was adopted from the create a which implements i will try and find a link but an example for how to get a safe this solution does not require the this is just how he solves the problem which i find really class safedatareader gets an integer from the returns 0 for public int return gets an integer from the returns 0 for public int if return return public object object val if return return public where int index if return return new ok so how do we use this safe data so assume we have a cmd object which is all using mycolumn was null this will still work because a string can be null string this case myint will be set to 0 if mycolumn is int can also use the getnullable method that is not part of his and not sure where it came but it looks correct to portable is well since it is implementing idatareader it should be very and should be able to be swapped in and out so long as the calling code expect to be

solution is to use a licensing technology with a this is a small device that plugs into usb or another port on the and serves as a physical key to activate the third solution is to provide a that when the software starts it queries a server on the network on the lan or else accessed at your company via the that validates that the usage of the software is this is a good solution for so customers can install your software on many but you license it for simultaneous use on a limited number of is an example of a license management mac address of the network card is the solution i used last time i worked for a company that licensed software to run on a specific i want to offer a if you do this type of you have to anticipate that become an administrative to track your once you have a few hundred be amazed at how frequently you get phone calls with requests to change upgraded our server to a network and now the work because the new adapter a different mac else the customers may replace their whole and need an updated license to run your software on the new we got these calls practically every day at the company i worked also need to trust the customer to stop using your software on the old computer network if you give them a new if you trust them to obey the license in the first how can you trust that throw away the old you plan how going to support this administrative license your product in this only inconvenience your good who would have cooperated

solved this one using much to my dismay when i discovered that python can do this in one simple goal is to create an adding machine using arrays of int ended up using an array of values to simulate an adding but i represented the number which you can do because the problem only asks for the sum of the this means order is essentially doing doubling the value 1000 so can double the value 1 stored in 1st element of the and continue looping until your value over this is where you will to keep track of a carry first power of 2 that is over 10 so the elements in the array the 5th iteration are 6 and when you loop through the starting at the 1st value becomes 12 you keep the and set a carry bit on the index of the which value is doubled you get 2 plus the 1 for the carry bit equals now you have 2 and 3 in array which represents this process 1000 times have an array with roughly elements that you can easily add	
	
some a duplicate way of performing certain tasks is available because they further abstracted it in a subsequent think about the webclient class which i believe was introduced in it basically wraps a lot of the common tasks you used to have to do with several different classes the old classes are obviously still there if you need to do things a little and for backward but if all you need to do is download a resource from the web as a got usually using because not splitting hairs over cpu so the solution with the least amount of code is the preferred method if not concerned with if programming a server task where no user is going to be on a process and you need to open one file and read it into a go with the static method that lets you do the whole thing in one

some more details of what environment you are using difficult to be but a few of pointers to things that can easily go wrong when setting up sure you have the camera set up to look at point you are drawing the this can be surprisingly and the simplest approach is to implement glutlookat from the opengl utility make sure you front and back planes are set to sensible off backface at least to start sure with production code backface culling gives you a quick performance but remarkably easy to set up normals incorrectly on an object and not see it because looking at the invisible to call glflush to make sure that all commands are drawing to the back buffer then failing to call glswapbuffers is also a common you can run into issues with buffer formats although if you copy from sample code that works on your system this is less likely to be a coding tends to be quite straightforward to debug once you have the basic environment correct because the output is but setting up the rendering environment on a new system can always be a bit tricky until you have that first cube or sphere i would recommend obtaining a sample or template and modifying that to start with rather than trying to set up the rendering window from using glut to check out first drafts of opengl calls is good technique

suppose anyone knows whether a sql server agent job can ask information about such as its own or the path running aware of and but this because you have to specify the job idea is that we want code that we have to manage by being able to call a sproc which will identify the current any server agent can job ask information about

sure about the full framework but in the compact framework it will be slower cause cf has no virtual call tables although it does cache the this means that a virtual call in cf will be slower the first time it is called as it has to do a manual it may be slow every time it is called if the app is low on memory as the cached lookup may be

surely does just because different containers have different memory access patterns which could play a work on as these are not although it would be possible to implement a specialization for that would shuffle the it would probably have strange and surprising semantic consequences if you have an iterator inside sorted range in a its value will change after the which would not be true with this	
	
surprised at how many people suggest that the os can do a better job at figuring out your caching needs than you can in this specialized while i do this for i did do it for similar processes and i ended up using a ramdisk with scripts that automated the this i think go with a modern source control at every compile it would check in the source code an experimental branch if automatically so that every compile would result in the data being saved start start the ramdisk and pull the current base do the etc all the while the edits are being saved for the final check in when and you even have to involve your regular there are background synchronizers that will automate things the issue is that they be optimized for programming and may need to do full directory and file scans occasionally to catch a source code control system is design for exactly this so it would likely be lower overhead even though it exists in your build in mind that a background sync in the case of a power is you would end up having to figure out what was saved and what saved if things went with a defined save point each or forced by have a pretty good idea that it was at least in a state where you thought you could compile use a vcs and you can easily compare it to the previous code and see what changes applied

suspect your memory issues are from keeping the bsp tree in so keep the bsp on disk and only keep some chunks in this should be fairly easy with as the structure lends itself more than some other tree and the logic should be to be both efficient and memory friendly you could have a cache dirty with the cache size set to available memory less a bit for breathing

switching from vs2005 to vs2008 i found an issue that i program works fine under vs2005 in both release and debug under when entering the debugger an assert is i let the program run debug or release no assertion at spent almost two days on this and i understand what i do of the have a mfc dialog based program that creates a user thread that creates the main dialog of the worker thread loops infinitely and posts each second a message to the the message is processed in the gui parts of my initinstance of the gui pdlg new return worker return dialog message handler is like lparam plist ps delete return works perfectly fine with with but as soon as a put a breakpoint and enter the debugging i have an assertion raised line null must be if either of the above asserts fire and you writing a multithreaded it is likely you have passed a object from one thread to and have used that object in a way that was not simple inline wrapper functions should be in cwnd objects should be passed by hwnd one thread to the receiving thread can the hwnd with a cwnd object by using it is dangerous to pass objects from one thread unless the objects are designed to be used such a i remove the gui thread and create the dialog into the cwinapp the problem occur anybody have any i doing something in vs2008 but not in

tag in the software context typically means a meaningful name or attribute being assigned to that in version control scenarios a tag is a meaningful name given to a particular state of the files represented by that for example the tag 20090401 might be assigned to the source code as it looked on april tagging something can also mean describing it or categorizing for example software such as or firefox might all be tagged to categorize them on a download allowing users to create tags and use existing tags is a powerful method to categorize content and help people zero in on items of a tag is simply an extra tidbit of information a person can gain insight into data tagging is useful for many reasons in software for example in my git repository i have a habit of creating tags based on date which can easily be ordered and parsed by a i can also give changes a more human consumable name such as the tag or or this allows for an understanding while also allowing for machine

the advantages of encapsulation so massive that i should go ahead and have getter getters and setter getters and so or should i take encapsulation in healthy measures and leave the field as a public encapsulation has nothing to do with wrapping a around a private in small or when writing the tradeoff is but when left unchecked in a system like the one its a an problem with is that they create overly tight coupling between the object with those methods and the rest of the of the advantages of real encapsulation is that it reduces the need for getters and decoupling your object from the rest of the system in the than exposing the implementation of gamecharacter with why not give gamecharacter an interface that better reflects role in the game instead class private intelligence public intelligence return public void not try better class public void todo update public int even still interface public void might update public int class ogre implements never increases intelligence after grabbing other a gamecharacter can grab the effect of each gamecharacter grabbing the same gameobject can but the details are fully encapsulated within each gamecharacter how the gamecharacter is now in charge of handling its own intelligence update which can happen as it grabs for the setter the complications you note with having have you might be able to dispense with the getintelligence method depending on the allen holub takes this idea to its but but that approach seem to be very

the answers so far assume that in the first line of the second example is the instance variable behind the this is the default the that the first line assigns to is a local then the property is and you will leak the object unless you release it later in the is an instance but the property is actually backed by a different instance or no instance variable at then you are writing code and it may be a echoing the previous if is the instance variable backing the then this is not a since the method that you call in the second line will release the object that you put in the instance variable in the first

the author of one of the features gitx has is the visualization of as can be seen visualization is currently done by reading commits which are emitted from git in the correct for each commit the parents are so fairly easy to build up the lanes in the correct like to speed up this process by using my own commit pool and linearizing the commits this allows me to reuse existing loaded commits and allows git to emit commits faster because it have to emit them in the correct not sure what algorithm to use to accomplish it is important that the building is as the loading of commits can take a long time seconds for which should all be has gone the same and a patch that shows how it is but my tcl skills are weak and the patch very thoroughly commented and a bit hard to also like this algorithm to be as have to handle hundreds of thousands of it also has to be displayed in a so important that access to specific rows is describe the input i have so the output that i want and a few have a current pool of commits in the form of a hash table that maps commit ids to commit this pool does not have to be complete all commits have a separate thread loading in new commits from with a callback that can be called every time a new commit is there is no guaranteed order in which the commits come but in most of the cases the next commit is a parent of the previous commit object has its own revision id and the revision ids of all its have a list of branch heads that should be that there a single of the dag that should be there also does not have to be a single graph need to linearize these commits in topological that a commit cannot be listed after its parents have been also need the that can be seen in the screenshot these probably need to be precomputed as most of them depend on their few necessary to relocate a list of for we might have to commits that are until a commit shows up which makes one head an ancestor of the branch tips must be important that this process is so that at least a partial view is available while the data is still this means that new data has to be inserted halfway and that the branch lines have to be hope i have described the problem clear enough linearizing of git

the entity framework keeps data in do many then as with many collections there are probably internal as you add items to a the internal array doubles in if you have a collection like an arraylist containing 256 and add the 257th item to then what happens internally is a new block of memory is allocated for a 512 item they 256 item array is copied to the new 512 item and then the 256 item array is made available for garbage thus at the point of transition you will have 768 items allocated in memory just because you added the 257th i have run into headaches with this when using because you need almost 3 times as much contigous unfragmented memory than what you really this is the property you see on and it is almost always a power of it double in size as bet is there are internal arrays that double in size as needed to support your collections of in memory so objects of the same type would probably be held in an internal array of size if like similar techniques elsewhere in the then whenever the 262145th item was both an array of 262144 and 524288 existed in memory while the items were copied to the new a total of 786432 items in the old array would stick around until the garbage collector decided it needed might be some options in the entity framework regarding concurrency support that you could disable which might improve memory i am only speculating here but to support concurrency they store both the current version of the and original version for comparison to support would also look at filtering what data you are interacting try to find clever criteria to limit what is queried and loaded in for if you had an application that allowed a user to edit customer but only certain accounts were assigned to then use that as your filtering criteria so that you only load in memory those accounts that the user could potentially interact

the library is a shared object or then everything in the library is but at run the cost in extra memory is offset by sharing the library the code between all the processes in memory that use that this is a big win for something like less so for but you probably asking about shared libraries are a simply a collection of individual object each the result of a separate compilation and possibly not even written in the same source each object file has a number of exported and almost always a number of imported job is to create a finished executable that has no remaining undefined imported of if dynamic linking is but bear with to do it starts with the modules named explicitly on the link command line possibly implicitly in its and assumes that any module named explicitly must be part of the finished it then attempts to find definitions for all of the undefined the named object modules expect to get symbols from some library such as your you have a single module that calls the funtion which will result in the linker looking for module that exports say that the library named a probably offers and but you specify you implied that and do not call each which i will was built from and where each defines the corresponding single then the linker will include and ignore if included that defined both and then it will include in the satisfying the need for and including the unused function others have there are linkers that are capable of splitting individual functions out of and including only those that are actually in many that is a safe thing to but it is usually safest to assume that your linker does not do that unless you have specific else to be aware of is that most linkers make as few passes as they can through the files and libraries that are named on the command and build up their symbol table as they as a practical this means that it is good practice to always specify libraries after all of the object modules on the link command

the make sure you know what the behaviour find the point where behaviour is no longer source control in case when you can roll back to the working version of the code and start adding your changes back little by until you find that bit that breaks the the event i had a bug recently which logged a dllnotfound exception in the application event that made no sence since the file was there all it took me some time to peek into the system and there was another error there about a dependency so use all available write critical information to the event log yourself and make sure it appear as google or stackoverflow to most problems have been experienced by other people you might be surprised by how many people had the same writing a question to for every question i asked there were at least one or maybe two that i did because just formulating the problem properly in writing led me to the create a small empty project and try to replicate the problem that might help to find out if the problem is caused by your code or by other parts of the the help of a away for a while if you or at least try to do something your mind will keep working on the problem and may deliver a solution nothing read the documentation and example where nothing once i was going crasy because my datagridview would not show checkboxes in a checkbox there was absolutely no way it could be me long time to find out for some the checkboxes would not show if a column was less then certain they were still visible in the think the reason was a certain ui toolkit we were i find but just by accidental mouse move i resized a column at run time and voila there they my all this sitting there

the method to check for null values instead of a costly error handling is almost always more expensive than catching a condition before it becomes an error handling should use not on error goto the conditional function that would look like this as a would prefer to write some helper functions that could be used to make the code more readable and more as key as as dim ordinal if return return end could alternatively write them as extensions to the class to make them even more

the problem having occurring in development or in remember that grails is constantly recompiling many aspects of your application only domain but controller and other classes as i have permgen issues but most are triggered by the steady recompilation of the files working you can turn this feature in then obviously you have a much more critical permgen memory issues are attributed to many of the frameworks on which grails is including and even own you could try tweaking the maximum heap size for your web container or could also try a different implementation of the like which is supposed to be considerably better at garbage collection and other means of never tried it but since i too am in the middle of developing and extensive grails i may be shopping solutions to these problems good

the right that depends entirely on the if you need to plug your code into another framework or whatever you probably have to use whatever language that framework is made making your own probably there are several reasons why suggest you go with another well suited for if your goal is to learn programming through these go with a language that is more amenable to by is full of pitfalls and things that to until one day they add to this a horribly complex syntax and some pretty complex idioms and techniques you have to master to work around quirks of the language that simply are in pretty much any other and you have a good source of bugs and and not much has no concept of come with any kind of support for processing or playing loading or saving audio files or anything most modern languages have some form of audio support built into the standard language least the ability to load and play mp3 files and other such in all of this will have to be done through libraries and you have a real choice in say go for something like python or easier to come with a lot more functionality out of the and make it a lot harder to shoot yourself in the i recommend to someone who already an experienced

there a way to limit the header files that recursively scans for directives to a particular directory or set of like it to recursively scan the header files within my project i know that they external dependencies are not going to change being boost and qt pretty i end up with around targets in the dependency tree which takes a while to process in a minute build time even if no files have actually only solution found so far is to take advantage of the include environment variable using this means need not be informed of the include paths using the and hence will not scan this seems a bit of a feel like i must be missing something obvious because i been able to find other people experiencing similar even though i ran into this almost the closest come is from the debug output it also scans most of the header files more than i know if this means that they are added as dependencies more than but certainly the cost of loading a file and scanning the entire contents must add i could tell it not to bother scanning a particular directory or set of directories in which i can guarantee the header files are not going to that would be there any way to prevent from recursively scanning header files for

there absolutely are situations where it is better to not catch an an exception can sometimes tell you that your program is in an unknown there are a number of exceptions where this is pretty much intrinsically true given the exception a essentially tells you is a and by catching such an you may hide the which sounds good in the short but in the long term be happier to fix the product may not but it certainly have the expected this is also true for exception types we invent for the fact that exception a has been thrown should be and yet it has so a something very important happens when you catch an the blocks for the whole call stack inside the try block anything it will be what do those finally blocks and if the program is in an unknown i really do mean they could erase valuable customer data from the they could throw more they could corrupt data in making the bug impossible to when an exception indicates an unknown you want to run any more so whatever you catch the let it fly and your program will terminate and windows error reporting will be able to capture the state of the program as it was when the problem was originally if you catch the you will cause more code to which will screw up the state of the program should you throw an exception knowing it be i think that question misunderstands the nature of reusable the whole idea of a method is that it has a that it it accepts certain parameters and returns a certain plus also it throws certain exceptions under certain the contract up to the caller what they do with for some exception a might indicate a recoverable for other it might indicate a and from what i said it should be clear that if an exception indicates a must not be if wondering what this means for the enterprise exception handling pretty they tell you to and then decide whether to rethrow based on your too late the blocks have already executed by that do

these actually three different concepts or am i getting been reading articles about threading and garbage collection together and have confused i think this may just be the term for sections of code that you want multiple threads accessing at the same time inside lock and no real clue here msdn says something along the lines of tells a host that exceptions thrown within the section might have wider and that of the clr sql may choose to handle exceptions thrown within critical regions differently and most in what real world scenarios might i need to mark code as a critical execution i came across this when reading about the criticalfinalizerobject in a garbage collection all i can understand from msdn on this one is that code within one of these regions is somehow guaranteed to run and must therefore not throw what is an did google this but it just asked me if i meant of bounds is it any unhandled or only certain types of and most in what real world scenarios might i need a execution i understand the concepts at all not sure what tags this question needs other than between and execution

these data classes set one level above the primitives constraining data to make it they sit just above the and which is where talking about refactoring the validation code into a separate problem with refactoring the validation is that the regex necessary for validation exists only in the subclasses of since each subclass has a different this means that the validation data is only available to the not any of if i factor out the validation callers would need access to the class internal static readonly regex regex public string value regex enforced by so no values public password original original public static explicit operator string value new value when reading a value from the database or reading user the password constructor forwards the to the base class to handle the another trick is that it trims the end characters in case the database type is char rather than so i have to remember to do here is what the main constructor for regexconstrainedstring looks string regex if if throw new meet minimum length of if if throw new exceeds maximum length of if throw new value specified must match callers would need access to the i think my best bet is to implement a method in the which forwards the data to the method in the base in other i would add this line to the password static bool string value like this because replicating the subclasses constructor having to remember to trim the string again and pass the same lengths when this requirement would be forced upon all subclasses of and not something i want to these data classes like password is so because regexconstrainedstring handles most of the implementing there are other complications with factoring out the the validation involves running and storing a regex match in the since some data types may have properties that report on specific elements of the for my sessionid class contains properties like which return a matched group from the match stored in the data class the bottom line is that this static method is an entirely different since essentially incompatible with the constructor the constructor cannot use so i would end up replicating code once could factor out the validation code by replicating it and tweaking it for a static context and imposing requirements on or i could keep things much simpler and just perform the object the relative extra memory allocated would be as only a string and match reference is stored in the everything such as the match and the string itself would still be generated by the validation so no way around i could worry about the performance all but my experience has been that is more because correctness often leads to numerous other for i ever have to worry about improperly formatted or sized data flowing through my because only meaningful data types are which forces validation to the into the application from other be it database or of my validation code was removed as a and i find myself only checking for nulls having reached this i now understand why including nulls was billion dollar seems to be the only thing i have to check for even though they are essentially in my complex objects having these data types as fields cannot be constructed with but i have to enforce that in the property which is because they otherwise would never need validation only code that runs in response to changes in simulated the clr function calls both and found that when all data is the performance difference is only fractions of a millisecond per thousand which is when roughly half the passwords are throwing exceptions in the three orders of magnitude which equates to about 1 extra sec per 1000 the magnitudes of difference will of course multiple as multiple clr calls are made for multiple columns in the but a factor of 3 to 5 for my is an extra 3 5 second per 1000 updates acceptable to as a trade off for keeping my code very simple and that depends on the update if my application were getting 1000 updates per a 3 5 second delay would be on the other i was getting 1000 updates a minute or an it may be perfectly in my i can tell you now that quite so i think just go with the instantiation and allow the errors of in this test i handled the errors in the clr instead of letting sql server handle marshalling the error info to sql and then possibly back to the could definitely slow things down much i guess i will have to fully implement this to get a real but from this preliminary pretty sure what the results will

thing that jumps out at me with this why are you using ints instead of a class to represent true this is a simple but a piece class seems to jump out as a fairly obvious class to with int you really have 3 presumably something you should check for 0 before bothering to check for if they are the same it will be quicker really cares this need to be and make more logical sense the square if so then do not bother checking if the squares hold the same for simple things like especially when you are just starting try to embrace it is a different way of and it takes so practice as much as you

thing you can do is you need to do it to go from to and you need it to go from to any reference to an so you can call methods even without if you do less you let the compiler do more work for you and catch things that stated goal is to be able to check that the thing getting out of your list really is an adding as an implemented interface would allow you to achieve that goal in that your major for not doing that hold any want to be able to compare references for no com requires that if you call twice with the same guid on the same you get the same interface pointer both if you have two arbitrary interface and you them both to then the results will have the same pointer value if and only if they are backed by the same you seem to want your list to only contain and you have delphi 2009 where a generic would be you can discipline yourself to always explicitly add values to the never values of any descendant whenever you add an item to the use code like as any duplicates in the list are easy to and your are assured to actually solve the but it given the rule the object explicitly implements all its you can check for things like and if added items to the list like i described safe to disable the enabling the assertion lets you detect when someone has changed code elsewhere in your program to add an item to the list running your unit tests frequently will let you detect the problem very soon after the above points in you can check that anything that was added to the list was added correctly with this and i recall whether the compiler accepts comparing an value to an iunknown value if compiler then simply change the declaration iunknown the supports function the assertion then either you added something to the list that support at or the specific interface reference you added for some object cannot serve as the if the assertion then you know that will give you a valid that the value added to the list to be an value given your type declarations this is a safe because the interfaces implemented by form an inheritance tree that degenerates to a simple there are no branches where two interfaces inherit from each other but have a common if there were decendants of and implemented them the above code be valid because the reference held in necessarily be the reference for that the assertion would detect that and need to add it with as you disable the cost of getting the types right is paid only while adding to the not while reading from the i named the variable to discourage you from using that variable elsewhere in the there only to support the and it have a valid value once assertions are

think a good starting point is to systemise the bug fix if going at assuming your code base is and these bugs are difficult to start with some how long to understand the how long to which code is being fixed there a pattern when you do you add another unit do you review individual and team where bugs are couple of weeks doing that will give you a really good basis for future it will also be a professional approach that your manager should buy

think adobe tries to access the cross domain file on port 843 and if it cannot the file on that port it tries the port that trying to connect to 80 if not sure but you might want to check to make sure that your server allows access to the worth mentioning is that you should allow full access to the directory where your local swf application do this with the adobe settings a side i think the settings manager is one of the worst ui atrocoties in the flash eco just the fact that they need to clarify in a text underneith the manager that it is infact not a screenshot really takes the	
	
think allows launching a process on a remote so wmi or shelling to something like psexec may be your only options wcf is the way to avoid it offers no benefits for the general is no longer being and is deprecated in favour of wcf for a variety of reasons distributed objects become a pain in the neck due to versioning and state messaging is usually easier to set understand and also remoting had no security if i remember for setting this when the parent process spawns the remote it could pass a url as a command line the parent hosts a wcf service on that now if the spawned process needs to communicate back to subscribe to the parent it just connects to the url it was if the parent needs to initiate then make the wcf service or have the spawned process host its own wcf and tell the parent the url via the

think on the right track with your understanding of presentation as to when you should create a view the answer is probably in your you can probably get away with passing the blogpost and comments in the viewdata not but it gets the job and if that starts to feel ugly or then i would start thinking about making a view i usually end up with the notion of some sort of which includes the page common and then specific stuff for a particular in your that might end up as a which includes blogpost and list nice thing about that approach is that you can then test that controller by making a request and testing the blogviewpage to ensure that it contains the expected	
	
think one issue is the number of choices design of everyday says that usability is increased by having few and clear choices limiting the choices a specification increases usability for the envisioned task and but this necessarily decreases flexibility in i think doet a little with the example a push the door already one the idea of an affordance is to make it clear which way it the limitation comes first and the clarity comes the limitation has more to do with and because each time the door opens we anticipate where it swings and security because it can be reinforced in a chosen direction for barring really think we limit choices so that we know how do open a because we make them swing if we thus once the limits have been established that the push plate makes it clear what you have to do on your side of the

think the answer to this will depend on what you want to do in the event a symbol does come in at exactly the same could create a unique index on the symbol and the datetime column but this would cause a unique key violation for one of the two if designing for this could be an expensive option is to have a timestamp which would insure that even if you do happen to get two identical symbols at the exact same your insert will not real question is what do you want to do with that second identical can you afford the expense of checking to see if an identical symbol and datetime already exists in the table before you write to so you could then log and discard the

think the most important principle is yagni gonna need in other write extra code until actually because if you write it in advance the requirements and constraints may well have changed you finally do need dependency all this stuff adds complexity to your making it harder to understand and my rule of thumb is to keep things as simple as possible no and to not add complexity unless it gains me more than enough to offset the burden it if you are actually testing and having a mock object would be very useful then by all means define an interface that both your mock and real classes but create a bunch of interfaces on the purely hypothetical grounds that it might be useful at some or that it is oo

think you can easily do giving the sax parser a resource to read and then closing it and the sax parser still expects to read from it hence throwing an document you want to do this i think your sax parser that implemented should silently swallow events once decided to ignore further your implementations of should perform a check to see whether still interested in these events before way the sax parser can run cleanly to the end of the document without you processing any more why not record the fact that closed the input and then when you get an document see if it in fact and only log an error if it really was

think you it this does work as a css selector modern expressed in a javascript string literal you would naturally need another round of this work in jquery because its selector parser is not completely it uses this regex to parse the part of an being the group containing the opening which weirdly are allowed to be multiple opening or no opening quotes at the then can parse any until it hits the first ending the there is no provision for css special so you match an arbitrary string value in regex parsers the good news is you have to rely on jquery there are perfectly good dom methods you can in particular if do something with is many times simpler and faster than asking jquery to laboriously parse and implement your and you can use any value string you like without having to worry about escaping special

this a covariance a static versus dynamic dispatch static dispatch means an overloaded method call is bound to the appropriate type at compile time based on the type of the passed base derived base void base a new prints derived b new prints dispatched based on declared base c new prints void void dispatch means the function is bound at runtime based on the actual type of the object stored in the public virtual void derived public override void void base a new prints derived b new prints dynamically dispatched based type of object stored in base c new prints void void last print shows the difference between the like most oop only supports dynamic dispatch for the implicit parameter to as in other words methods are dynamically but methods are typical solution to fake multiple dispatch in single dispatch languages is by using the which would work for you

this is an issue between the browser and the flash as sifr inserts the flash movies into the the browser initializes the flash plugin with the path to the flash if the movie is not yet in a local requested from the since the movies are inserted within a few this would mean that a request is made for each inserted tries to prevent this by prefetching the flash it does this ones per browser based on a session this merely fires off a request for the movie and hopefully that file is in the cache by the time replacement therefore its important to load the sifr javascript code as early as and to activate sifr properly by passing the flash movies to the my experience the only way to reliably test this process is clearing browser closing all browser instances get rid of the session then opening the browser and going straight to the page you want to i find the activity monitors within browsers so either check through an http proxy or the server one remaining improvement i could make is to try and detect the progress of the and hold off on replacing elements until the prefetch is

this is my first question on so hopefully this something been beaten to death and i been able to find developing an application that is going to be distributed we have gotten the rights to distribute sql server 2008 express edition with our but exactly how to do this is a little more right now using a standard visual studio setup and i was obviously hoping for something very like a configurable merge but obviously no such thing exists or i be posting here road i had started going down was to include the exe with our then use a custom install action to extract it and pass command line arguments to the sql installer to create our named where the problem comes is i can run the script from windows and it installs sql server just as it but i run the sql installer from my custom action because saying that there is already another installation in this other installation of my and it going to end until sql server so essentially at a deadlock until sql finally gives up and errors i want is a named instance of sql server for my application that is installed with it and gets uninstalled with writing my own installer is not an option because of and my coworker says installshield is not an option because of complexity never used so take his word for does anyone have any a named instance of sql server 2008 express with my	
	
this is not a conflict on the theoretical level but a conflict on an implementation problem is not having domain models as versus more complex object map where order has orderitems and some calculatetotal the specific problem is for that order needs to grab the latest wholesale prices of the orderitem from some web service in china so you have some spring service running that allows calls to this pricequery service in order has calculatetotal which iterates over every gets the latest and adds it to the how would you ensure that every order has a reference to this pricequery how would you restore it upon loading from and fresh this is my exact easy way would be to pass a reference to the calculatetotal but what if your object uses this service internally throughout its what if used in 10 it gets messy to pass references around every way would be to move calculatetotal out of the order and into the but that breaks oo design and we move towards the old way of domain objects require references to many but these objects get persisted or so any references they hold to outside components beans in this are transient and get wiped they need to be when the object is or loaded from the but this is extremely ugly and i see an elegant way to do a while now practiced loose coupling and di with the help of helped me a lot in keeping things manageable and a while i read design and some martin as a been trying to convert my domain models from simple dtos simple representations of a table just data no into a more rich domain my domain grows and takes on new my domain objects are starting to require some of the beans that i have in my spring this has quickly become a nightmare and one of the most difficult parts of converting to a rich domain there are points where i am manually injecting a reference to the application context into my object is loaded from repository or other responsible entity since the component references are transient and obviously get object is created from factory since a newly created object lacks the component object is in a quartz job or some other place since the transient component references get ugly because passing the object an application context reference and expecting it to pull out by name references to the components it this direct ugly code because in all of those mentioned places i need logic for injecting an error prone because i have to remember to inject in all those places for all those which is harder than it has got to be a better way and hoping you can shed some light on can i resolve the conflict between loose injection and a rich domain

this is obviously as for you could look at it from both on one the scope of anything in code should be as small as on the other you could say that a constant is more likely to be used troughout a class and should therefor be declared at the class level at all to prevent double would declare class level constants only and use method constants only when there is a good reason for reason could be that a methods purpose is to provide abstraction on some api call and you require some constant values for in this case you want class level constants to clutter the rest of a

understand what you mean with did lazy lazy loading is a it is turned on by default and you can turn it off if you like are two kinds of lazy for references to other entities and for this int id private reference to another user myuser list to other mycomments loading on the reference to you have lazy loading on the you need to define all members of the user class nhibernate will create a so called the proxy is a classed defined at runtime which derives from your code is accessing it as user and is not aware that is is a but when you access one of its members the first the properties are loaded from the you want to turn off lazy loading on the user you need to do this in its nhibernate creates always instances of type no you need to have anything loading on the list of you use lazy loading on the list of it is the list itself that implements the lazy if you access the list the first it is loaded from the nhibernate uses a list that implements but is not you want to turn off lazy loading in the you do this in the mapping of lazy loading is a good and you application does not have to care about it but there are some for if you serialize a and it is a you get a not initialized proxy instead of anything lazy loading only works as long as the session is it is not always faster to use lazy if you need to load all the data its faster to load it in one the configuration needs to be done answer your original is lazy loading required for is lazy loading required in my most probably only small and rather trivial applications need lazy if you have a system with many persistent need lazy

union contains a set of your particular you can store the float char or int in the memory will only be allocated for the in the all items in the union will share the same of in other writing one value into the union followed by another will cause the first value to be need to go back and ask yourself you are you truly want the values of and to be mutually exclusive only one value can exist at if consider using a union in conjunction with an enum value outside the indicating which member in the union is the one at any particular point in this will allow you to get the memory benefits of using a at the cost of more dangerous code anyone maintaining it will need to be aware that the values are mutually exclusive it is indeed a consider this option if you are creating many of these unions and memory conservation is vital on embedded you may not even end up saving memory because you will need to create enum variables on the stack which will take up memory you want these values to be simultaneously active and not interfere with each if you will need to use a struct instead you put in your first this will use more memory when you instantiate a the memory that is allocated is the sum of all members some padding to the nearest word memory conservation is of paramount importance previous i would favour this example of how to use enums in conjunction with a float char int floatcharintunion unionselection selection selection selection unionselection switch case process case process case process

was wondering if any of you had successfully implemented ddd in a app and would like to share some are currently working on a smart client in flex and a backend in on the server we have a service layer exposed to the client that offers crud operations amongst some other service i understand that in ddd these services should be repositories and services should be used to handle use cases that do not fit inside a right we mimic these services on the client behind an interface and inject implementations via an ioc some questions the server expose repositories to the client or do we need to have some sort of a facade is able to handle security for the client implement repositories ddd in knowing that in the most of the logic is view related and real business logic lives on the all communication with the server happens asynchronously and we have a single threaded programming model on the about mapping client to server objects and vice we tried but reverted back to exposing the state of our objects and mapping directly to i know this is considered bad but it saves us an incredible amount of general i think a new generation of applications is coming with the growth of javafx and curious how ddd fits into and	
	
was wondering if it is possible to include svg content inside a panel whatever would work in be able to add more to the svg add a circle or a programmatically and handle mouse events this be in svg or tried creating an html object adding something along the lines work visible in but not sure if it was because i did it wrong or not was able to do a simple example in gwt with google linechart but like to move away from google visualization and be able to generate the svg myself and customize it looked around and many resources points to using canvas but not sure if the best route also a bit baffled about the example i tried a simple of it to try locally and it seem to work at i was however able to get another sample working with just htm with src pointing to svg l separate svg file but i been able to access it using gwt using read about svg not working with hosted browser and compiling it does work but i am uncertain how to refer to the svg i have placed into the html via if i can access it then presumably i can add to its tried in but that seem to work or did i mess guess the goal is to be able to manipulate a svg file which i linked somehow in gwt or in and be able to modify it based on been programming functionality inside of the actual svg in our our svg is an embedded object and we passed to the embedded passing information from an embed object to and from html is quite doable since the html has access to our svg functions and the svg has access to the are more transparent ways of doing so where firebug could see the svg directly which is nice but now not quite thus i think any of the solutions looked at were iframes but i could be a little svg can be pretty slow would say my issue is solved but not using nor gwt at the moment but the method i described in my answer should still work if i want to use svg in

we look at enterprise application design then the methods for fetching users getuserbyid and getallusers would be in separate class you can name it userdata or userdao data access you should design an interface for userdao with appropriate methods for handling user objects such as getuserxxx and so should be an implementation of userdao as per the data for example if your users are stored in database then you can implement the logic of accessing database in the implementation of are the advantages of keeping the access methods in separate user object should be plain object with just getter setter this would facilitate passing object across tiers from data access to business tier to web this would also help keep user object the data access logic is loosely coupled from the user object that means if the datasource then you need not change the user object this also assists in test driven development where you might need to have mock objects during testing if user object is complex object with relations with other objects such as address or department or role then the complexity of relationships will be encapsulated in userdao rather than leaking in the user porting to frameworks like nhibernate or or linq would become easier if the patterns are

what doing is really high volume then what looking for is something like it is a distributed work queue you just put a job on the queue and then forget about course then you need something at the other end reading the queue and processing the there are multiple ways of doing easiest is probably to have a cron job that runs sufficiently often to read the work queue and process the alternatively you can use some kind of persistent daemon process that is woken up by work becoming advantage of this kind of approach is you can tailor the number of workers to how much work needs to get done and beanstalkd handles distributed prorcessing the sense that the listners can be on different

what i understand you need a file system and not a memory allocation at in embedded systems dynamic memory allocation in a disk is a contradictory a either a hard disk or a flash used for persistent storage is much different than it is not only the way you access but the fact that disk storage when writing to a disk you need to have an algorithm for avoiding bad have you thought of this or can you consider your disk fault file system will deal both with space allocation and bad sectors is usually used in embedded although fragmentation performance is rather this prevented it from being used in many embedded most flash based devices actually use i suggest to start with what you have your operation system you use and the driver for your investigate if a suitable solution is already supported from also keep in mind that embedded devices are more difficult to debug if you set to implement your own algorithms expect longer development

why do i get uzbekistan for the not selecting the item that grouping if you by get the expected however grouping by a different column so mysql know that is taking part in a and selects any old value from that in the join of it is possible you will see other countries than is part of a wider problem with mysql being permissive on what you can select in a group by for you can gender from registrations group by mysql will happily pick one of the gender values for a registration from each even though there is no direct causal link between country and other dbmss will refuse the above command on the grounds that there guaranteed to be one gender per as as registrations r join country c on by because a functional dependency between and you have correctly described your as a primary with rollup extension is a bit of a hack in the way it on the rollup row stage at the it runs over the entire result set to grab its and sets the column to also null other columns that have a functional dependency on that it probably but mysql currently really understand the whole thing about functional if you select it will show you whichever country name value it randomly and if you select it will show you whichever country id it randomly though is the join so must be the same as which is you can do to work around the problem by should be ok if are as well as and check that for being with rollup and do a separate query for the end this will be a little slower but it will also be ansi compliant so your app could work on other mysql has an option that is supposed to address this but it goes much too far and only lets you select columns from the group not columns that have a functional dependency on the group so it will make valid queries fail as making it generally

work with but in there are differences between these two syntaxes for referring to controls on a first causes access to create a hidden property that returns the the result of this is checking of references to second uses the default collection of the current form and does not provide assume that vba works the same in adps as in so why not try converting the offending control references to bang instead of this would eliminate the checking and might allow the project to compile without having to reconstruct it that i think i would then try deleting the control removed the hidden property and add the control back with a new name and then compact know if adps can be but if they it should be decompiled as this should remove the problematic hidden property definition permanently and if the cause of the you should be able to revert to the dot operator and get checking what seen too many corruption problems with the dot operator and always use the bang in all my ok with not having checking of control with the bang you lose automatic intellisense in some cases is a blessing as intellisense can get in your way in some but you can invoke a different intellisense list with this list is not limited to the control but once you start you get the usual autocomplete that jumps you to the appropriate location in the	
	
worked on databases where we tried to create tables with 2b rows of data that we got to 500m and one of the biggest gotchas of working with such large table was the time taken to do deletions i often see the approach where old records are archived and then deleted from the main if the table is big enough that deletion will run for many hours as the indexes are sure where the cut off is but gut feel indicates a table 10m rows is probably too our approach was to partition data by so we ended up with a table for a week of and another summary table for and another summary for years very common in btw this was on sql interested to know if the are better at this type of stuff

working in delphi delphi but my question is language you have a which sends messages to another i assume tclient instances would have a private reference variable of type a method somewhere in tclient would create an instance of tfacade and assign it to this private the tclient client class would need to use the tfacade tfacade works with other classes them and presumably tfacade instances do the same have private workerclass and create instances of the workerclasses in the tfacade tfacade classes need to use the workerclass how does information get from the workerclasses back to if tclient is a for it might receive user input which is used by in used by the after workerclasses have manipulated or used they need to communicate information back to tclient output information will be displayed in the tclient hope this is basically just asking if class1 calls a method in and class2 calls a method in how does class3 send information back to since i am a be afraid of being too simple or too specific in your i can handle it as always al communication between

working on a project which is in serious need of some performance do i write a test that fails if my optimizations do not in improve the speed of the elaborate a problem is not discovering which parts to i can use various profiling and benchmarking tools for problem is using tests to document that a specific optimization did indeed have the intended it would also be highly desirable if i could use the test suite to discover possible performance regressions later suppose i could just run my profiling tools to get some values and then assert that my optimized code produces better the obvious problem with is that benchmarking values are not hard they vary with the local is the answer to always use the same machine to do this kind of integration if you would still have to allow for some fuzziness in the since even on the same hardware benchmarking results can how then to take this into maybe the answer is to keep older versions of the program and compare results before and this would be my preferred since mostly environment does anyone have experience with this i imagine it would only be necessary to keep one older version if all the tests can be made to pass if the performance of the latest version is at least as good as the former testing best practices when doing

working on a reporting system that allows the user to arbitrarily query a set of fact constraining on multiple dimension tables for each fact written a class that automatically assembles all the correct joins and subqueries based on the constraint and everything works as i have a feeling that not generating the most efficient on a set of tables with a few million these queries take about 10 seconds to and like to get them down in the i have a feeling if i could get rid of the the result would be much more than show you my actual schema is much more show you an analogous example that illustrates the point without having to explain my whole application and data that i have a database of concert with artists and users can arbitrarily tag the artists and the so the schema looks like say i want to query the database for all concerts happening within one month of for all artists with and performing at concerts with and best query been able to come up with looks like as as as as as as join artist on inner join venue on in select from inner join tag as a on inner join tag as b on in select from inner join tag as a on inner join tag as b on between and interval 1 query but i like having those multiple if i could accomplish the same logic purely using join i have a feeling the performance would drastically a perfect be using a real olap but my customers will be deploying to mysql or mssql or and i guarantee that a compatible olap engine will be so stuck using an ordinary rdbms with a star get too hung up on the details of this example real application has nothing to do with but it has multiple fact tables with an analogous relationship to the ones shown in this the and tables function as fact and everything else is a important to in this that the queries are much simpler to write if i only allow the user to constrain against a single or it only gets really tricky when i allow the queries to include and requiring multiple distinct my question what are the best techniques that you know of for writing efficient queries against multiple fact best way to join multiple fact

worth mentioning that you need to use to see if an object has a particular method	
	
would advise against implementing your drawing objects as vcl you will not gain much from but some things would be much more difficult than when coding this on your controls are so for parallel diagonal lines one control would be on top of the at least generally mouse events reach only the topmost control in the something you would have to correct in your own lines should have the end points so the user knows where to grab them for moving or something a custom control does not provide so have to code would probably simply create a line object and implement all functionality for moving and deleting lines	
	
would agree with others that a database would be your best you really are generating such a huge amount of data that it would cause a performance you might want to create two tables one as a source and another as an system would insert new data into the real time and a batch job would periodically move data from there to the archive when performance is a you would query only the smaller real time if you actually needed to query across all the you would query a view that unions the real time and archive	
	
would also consider not showing dynamic pictures since neither the server nor the client can effectively cache these	
	
would also like to point out that in some scenarios the different endianness for data stored in memory and data sent over network can be the reason of so make sure that you check this out if you are working at low	
	
would appreciate it if you had some pseudocode on this but just following it over i interfaces for the data access objects that directly access the this way you can pass in an object that only pretends that it accesses the this object would then return results consistent with the results your database would without actually doing any db your object could also simulate scenarios such as rolling back data to its original each into a single method that is the essence of a if your method is 500 lines long then there must be contiguous blocks in there that can be write a unit test for if your unit test is testing too that probably means your method is doing too you can extract methods by identifying the different things you are testing and then putting them in their own rinse and repeat until you only need one test for each on to other sounds like a code a transaction in and by itself should only be one contiguous if you need different users to finish your doing too keep track of your state on the db in terms of flags or not in terms of a db	
	
would argue that for most programmers and does not present a significant advantage or potential over standard multithreaded most people have threads to accomplish sequential and there that much potential for splitting up those threads to much smaller most benefits of would come from improvements to underlying frameworks database gui and 3d and the vast majority of developers would benefit future static analysis tools may be able to recommend pieces that could be split further into

would be interesting to know a little do you create the imageprotocol is it a local variable or a class member or do you allocate it in unmanaged memory with is it sent to the c directly as stack variable or as a really tricky it feels like the delegate data is moved around by the gc which causes the access the interesting thing is that the delegate data type is a reference data which stores its data on the gc this data contains things like the address of the function to call but also a reference to the object that contains the this should mean that even though the actual function code is stored outside of the gc the data that holds the function pointer is stored in the gc heap and can hence be moved by the i thought about the problem a lot last night but come up with a

would consider migrating the ms access portion to ms sql is possible but not sure of the issues related to that would handle a lot of the multi user issues that ms access had few issues converting other ms access applications to ms sql end stays in ms and the tables are linked to the ms sql db through so low and you get there is something technological that forces you to use ms the easiest thing to do would be to just create an odbc link to the oracle table through ms that way you are only updating it one i also question the decision to move the table from oracle to ms more trusting of oracle dbs right off the start and ms is not known to be highly performing over add more memory to the oracle give it a faster tightest bottle neck is not going to be the database going to be your so you are moving the problem from one server to another and you are adding to the network congestion by having to synchronise the ms access table with the oracle

would consider using a approach for all the extended essentially you define your static data from year over this will be things like company the definition of an address for example change year after these will be modled you would define a table that will contain a master of all the questions you and will be linked somehow to tell you what year those questions are valid this table might also indicate other attributes about the question that could let you dynamically create a gui on top of things such as regular expressions to validate the type of data a really naive approach which even after doing this would not be the end state of what i would model would probally have another table the correlates a year to a and this is what i would link the company this way we can reuse questions over and i have a picture to go along with tihs need to find a place to upload it edit soon as i get that	
	
would create a managed class to do the wcf work and expose the class as a com object to the	
	
would create a model type that the master page gets its data then derive the model type from the controller populates an instance of the and the master page picks it the master model could be an interface implemented by the in mvc ctps doing this required some intermediate classes to override type matching to get to base class i know if this has been fixed in	
	
would create simple and use a strong authentication has too many problems to brute force who sniffs the request can determine the username and password being but they even need they can just use an identical http that dialog pops difficult to which can be browsers will ask twice for a password before letting you difficult to logout or change you usually have to quit the to forget that let the browser save your which is another potential security	
	
would definitely appreciate it if anyone knows of something better than commonly i see to have headaches finding something is but pyqt seem to have the same development it seems to have some clever way to generate but complete pykde terminal and there is a dearth of documentation the developers compatibility with ui designer is controls as nice widget library as large as even support fonts by pygame is but opengl being a state machine is too annoying oriented models prevent making the a call in the wrong neat i wish it the tutorial work for though first i had to add the xulrunner path to then it still had problems with xpcom import wishlist for a ui library would integration uses builtins like modules like and language features like intermediate representation xul instead of generating hundreds of lines looking like mutlithreaded support locks or event posting so can be called from any let the designer manage locking with python locks if features as well scripting of a sequence of ui ability to keybind anything has but afaik binding done automatically by the ui and intercept for a standard though if the library was well designed and generated enough this would be a my html is so much easier to get something up than ui after working with pyqt 4 for a it gets the job done for simple currently not developing for end so looks the qtextbrowser is very useful for displaying basic html tables and generating html	
	
would definitely favour the 2nd approach of overloaded first approach blurs the definition of the method as it no longer has a single this in turn increases the of the making it more difficult for someone not familiar with it to understand the second approach each method has a clear each method is and some additional code which needs to be duplicated into both this can be out into a separate and each overloaded method could call this external would go a step further and each method to indicate the differences between the this will make the code more	
	
would do ashx in a situation like from your it sounds like a single search a single table limited group of tables in a single and a relatively limited all the mvc stuff is probably create a class that implements ihttphandler just do a generic handler if in visual studio 2005 or parse the query either create a dynamic sql string or pass the parameters to a stored and then use an xmltextwriter to create the you can point the xmltextwriter either to the output stream of the response or to a memory i use the memory stream approach because it gives me better error handling then set the content type to and stream the like this approach because easy to easy to easy to and gives you complete the downsides are that tightly bound to the database and may be less flexible than one of the web service framework based approaches if your scope increases over	
	
would do it like abstract class parent protected final string protected string only if this makes throw new cannot be birthmark class child extends parent public string means that the variable can be initialized once per the compiler able to make sure that every subclass will provide the assignment to birthmark so it forces the assignment to happen in the constructor of the parent added the checking for null just to sho wthat you also get the benefit of being able to check the arguments in one place rather than each

would go with the web development will continue to evolve and although the webforms model is a little odd if you are new to you decide your future is not the skills are transferable to also apply the to each the work is only half the the work could be great but a poor environment could ruin is another article that expands on the the past when needed to choose went on and searched for the i usually find a couple of people who have dropped them asking what they think of the	
	
would guess that 96 is a pretty small and you worry about it too if using you can use nsvalue to wrap the points than by using its method on the iphone or on mac os x being quite easy to create an array of cgpoints if you know the number of them ahead of i talked about these options not in this you can just make a 2d array in c like then use it like onepoint	
	
would have to do a lot to achieve any meaningful level of obfuscating the names alone is not since all of the standard functions will still be there they may be buried in a layer of and deriving the purpose of a particular function is easy once the code is formatted nicely anybody who really wants to know what your js code does and no matter what you do to it before their browser gets a copy of you have valuable business processes in your then doing it	
	
would have to i int start string s int while start index	
	
would have to override the function where the loaderinfo instance is and that might be in a private in the new function you could then instanciate your custom loaderinfo class but you would also have to do anything else that the overwritten method you might run into some security sandbox problems with loadinfo as overwriting a function like this is usually only posible when the function written with this in you could use the prototype chain to change the loaderinfo class at but i recommend not good practice in my you get this to work you still have the problem that your custom event will not work with any event that has properties not inheritet from the event class the progressevent that has progress related would say you properly should look for another the question you link to you talk about sending movieclip with your have you thought about reaching the other when you recieve the you get a reference to the object that dispatched it can you not use that reference to get the you could explain your problem in more detail in a new question so you still keep this i am sure there is a better easier way to solve

would implement by defining a generic root for lack of a better name call it the entity table should have at a minimum a single identity column on you could also include other fields that are common accross all your objects or even meta data that tells you this row is an order for of your actual will have a fk reference back to the entity this will give you a single unique id the seeds in my opinion is a bad and one that could lead to of the problems you mentioned i also see this being a pain to track and ensure you setup all new entities imagine a developer updating the system two years from i wrote this answer i had thought a but more about why your doing and i came to the same conclusion that matt

would like a win32 process to launch an external script and be able to retrieve the errorlevel that it other way around is quite just use or in your win32 app and the calling script gets its errorlevel value set from a win32 calling getting the script errorcode is not quite the tried using and calling but it always returns 0 and not the actual value of even if i end my called script with best guess is that a script is a process most probably is running instead and most likely always ending with a exitcode of i know that errorlevel is not the same as the process exitcode i would have hoped that would have mirrored i i just found i was using instead of in my batch it seems that the options has the advantage of only closing the running not when you are testing from command but the disadvantage of not setting the proper exitcode for for posterity what i am doing bool startupinfo tchar bresult if error return dword result result return dword error return return batch file looks i am passing my script to run as a parameter to the entry point the other files can either call exit or because everything is batch script error

would mock up the and test what it receives as part of your that way your surrounding code remains the same and is and by checking what you can assert whether the behaviour is as the return object is not of interest in this do you mock your you can either implement your own version to the same interface as the real world or using a mocking whichever approach you your code above needs to be configured with a given implementation of the on construction see for more info on how this may	
	
would need to use the method described at for certain if version will have it read the instructions on that page for how to wire it thing is that need to put jquery before the other added the code below to help you apply the the line causes an error then you may need to try a newer version of lightwindow files accordion scripts note you may need to swap some of your code from to the jquery doc you used to do you now must do	
	
would need to wrap everything that was on the stage in a sprite instance and then pass that sprite to using flex then you can also use the class to handle some of the layout and pagination for	
	
would never use habtm not because of any concern about elegance but because i can always imagine wanting to add data to a relationship in the future even if i see the point being lazy i would like to be able to just add the columns to the join rather than having to rework the relationships and then add the	
	
would not be surprised by a sbcl using twice the as it will probably use a cell rather than a but say for sure without actually things that keep memory hanging around for longer than expected are references that still have a path to the root allocation set tables i a good way of letting these things you could try interspersing explicit calls to gc in your code and make sure to far as not store things in global	
	
would not introduce a pk at the if you ever decide to use this table for other records as just refactor and add a new row you would probably need there is yet one reason to add such a if you use a framework that cannot update a record without having a pk that identifies the	
	
would not necessary keep only one backing bean per it depends on functionality but most of the time i had one bean per page as mostly one page handle one for example on a page i have a register link will link with and a shopping basket link do use this as i normally keep backing beans as action beans which holds data i want to write a wrapper in my backing bean to access the properties of my data	
	
would not rely on the because i am doubtful the c or standards would make explicit this but it makes sense that the compiler does it also makes sense that it exhibits this behavior even in the absence of any optimization specified to the there is no in string literals in c or are and thus when you are in a sense the string to a you do away with the attribute of the if you try to manipulate be caught at rather than at is actually a good reason to use char when assigning string literals to a variable of	
	
would not typically organise your sql database in quite this what you are describing are two entities that have a a meeting can have zero or more to model this in sql you would use three a meeting a participant table and a meetingparticipant the meetingparticipant table holds the links between meetings you might have something like this any sql syntax table meetingid name location table participantid firstname lastname table meetingid participantid populate these tables you would first create some into into into create a meeting or insert into insert into now add some participants to the into into into into you can select all the meetings and the participants for each meeting meeting m join meetingparticipant mp on join participant p on above should participantid location firstname 1 room 1 tom 2 room 1 dick 2 room 2 dick 3 room 2 harry you want to find out all the meetings that is in you would write something like meeting m join meetingparticipant mp on room room have omitted important things like primary keys and missing attributes such as meeting but it is clearer without all the	
	
would pass an extra context variable into the the view that has would pass a variable like and the other views would pass	
	
would personally just use two one for values and one for your desire for magic behavior is not very that being you could implement your own dict def def return def description def return use this class as foo just use a tuple if you only have 2 15 prints prints foo you decide to go the magic behavior then this should be a good starting	
	
would probably be avoiding the entity framework altogether for the of no that the famework was not to mention not as mature as said i would continue to evaluate the entity framework as sure it will be improved over	
	
would probably do it by simply having some kind of data structure linked holding the current initially this is then when the event you create some kind of representation of the new desired and add that to the each you clear the and go through the data mapping each representation into a suitble set of opengl this is really data structure is often referred to as a it is often in the form of a tree or where geometry can have and so	
	
would probably have to store the stack somewhere and go to the proper view on being you to do it only makes sense for some application state across berk	
	
would put an identity column on it know what the innodb equivalent harmless to do so and will make it much easier to select or delete a specific row if you ever need	
	
would rather overload the method and let jvm decides at compile time	
	
would read pbos and has posted two very nice bits sample code demonstrating pbos even though these as sample code good on any platoform because pbos fbos are opengl windowing system what are all these the	
	
would really recommend using stl or containers for you must use then i would recommend using a typedef to define the could also return then you would need to typecast it to the correct size in order to index it does not support dynamic multiple dimension as others have suggested you return an object on the stack local	
	
would recommend a 3rd option and that is to add a distinct clause to your 2nd option and give that a would vote for the 2nd option as being more efficient with the distinct clause you have hopefully added an index on in both just noticed a trick question there is no field in more than one teacher can teach a course add a table always avoid plurals in object names just a in this new table store the teachercourseid generated and the and you can allow more than one teacher per

would recommend an incremental each frame find a contiguous block of inuse memory that has free space on both sides and move it in whichever direction will allow it to or you could just move all blocks in one find a gap and a inuse block that is the best fit for it and move on the 360 you should probably use a thread to do the while on the ps3 it would be best to use the gpu to move the data around for	
	
would recommend grabbing a copy of the for reference a fairly nice and not too dry for a explains about threading take a look at the model 2 architecture which explains the best use of servlets and recommend looking at struts or spring if you only have a few days to get up to speed from once you have gained familiarity with servlets and then you could look at spring mvc for an approach that supports easier unit testing for	
	
would recommend using instead of as lxml is faster and the interface is the	
	
would recommend using though i think postgres is a great algorithms work great of the for text in other when you just construct the simplest possible search it just seems to the right is to what your intuition would suggest it should does rdb mgt very what it was designed but compare the implementation of the following on for or or followed by reuse the same query code to perform the following for and and and what it would take to implement the query in versus it take long to convince yourself that easier to construct flexible text query functionality with just more naturally suited for	
	
would restructure it so both lists were contained in one setter email want conflicting permission your lists would just check a particular you just add a couple functions to the def return def return def if return if return return everything in one place is a lot and you can make more interesting queries with less	
	
would say answer is a pretty good have looked at rails and all three inhabit the same with flex producing flash rias and gwt and rails doing the same for worked with there is a lot to like but some serious niggling the main one for me being the difficulty integrating html into a flex app no trivial task and there are few projects that can avoid on the other hand is daunting initially because and does not come with the same kind of drag and drop editor that flex provides in flex gwt designer is a pretty good equivalent to flex builder in the gwt world and for a java programmer with swing the architecture of gwt take much figuring to mention the sheer number of java programmers around who can pitch gwt to their managers as a simple their existing java the google brand terms of sellability within the a java tool is always going to be an easier sell than actionscript or ruby on hard to say for sure where things are headed but i would expect to see continued growth for all everyone wants ria these

would say it depends more on how many places going to the and less on how many classes might possibly implement the if only using folder in one or two places then i would say wait until an actual need for the interface before you implement it and if folder is going to be used in 100 different then you can save some time by programming to an interface up the	
	
would say it looks blurry kind of like as if you were viewing this on osx or i too agree that this is unacceptable together with of where font rendering is awful as while microsoft keeps on promising to fix this for 4 fact many of us need to stuff which leads to the following can ignore common sense and just ship the software making fonts bigger and what have so long as your customer the my you are working with you can wait until some future release until this is fixed for good look at how long wpf has been everyone knew about this problem guess what it been you are working with you get the perfect font rendering an algorithm that is even marginally better than what vista does face is same goes for the algorithm for an ideal cleartype is a mixture of judicious use of subpixel antialiasing and using font hinting i have done and have even had fun optimizing it for simd and the it a serious investment of your i tried this but it should oh if you want to kill the go having said i think provided you know taking advantage of hardware guess what trying to say is there a solution for winforms the best algorithm but there a solution for i wish someone would prove me	
	
would say that if your database is storing a currency value it should be hanging onto the units at the same it sounds like doing that can you add the locale to the database at the same could be a decent

would say that the difference is language but that in at abstract classes are the means by which interfaces are	
	
would say that there is an additional layer the service layer that sits between your business layer and the presentation layer or your business layer and the data layer depending on whether doing a or this layer would encapsulate service discovery and including data for see principles of enterprise application architecture in his concept the service layer sits between the business layer and the presentation layer this concept would apply to a or client	
	
would say that this is impossible every resulting row should be use programming language for getting these	
	
would say that you cannot avoid either of these having few overloads for your parts and having a statement somewhere down the also having to modify your code when adding new class might be your only being said you can get help with some other patters namely factory that could aid you in the building also sensible use of polymorphism all parts inherit from the some type be it class or can reduce the amount of and this	
	
would say the best way to handle this would be via can easily apply a different which can completely change the layout of your and thereby move all the controls this solution also allows you to easily do alternate renderings for mobile or or any other reason and is very other s you will obviously have other localization issuse such as translation or formats as but you will have to solve those via other are some examples of the same with the same where only the css has rendering completely your simple case where you have just two controls that you want to flip based on the in your stylesheet use either or absolute positioning the parent to reposition the two identical with two different

would start with a way you can static final static map new multivaluemap new 3 new 2 new 4 new 3 new 2 new 4 new 3 rules looks also like you are aways using pairs of integers as the list of it would probably clean your interface up if you refered to that as a rulepair or some other specified thus your integer array more	
	
would start with wamp apache mysql and teach yourself php and some basic while learning php you will discover that you can easily build and also complement your scripts with javascript for extra functionality and also css for the design will notice that all the abbrevations i noticed here have their own sections at i think they have an learning curve than many other and is a good base of languages to start wamp or lamp u use is easy to install as a bundle for you google and as ide i recommend using for example or	
	
would store the it tends to make code clearer when not calling all the and though in your case you may not need to change ids or allow elements without pretty common to want to do apphacker i expect efficiency improvements from doing as getelementbyid tends to be fairly in there any performance issues i should know from javascript objects to dom objects are fine on their but when a dom object has a link back to such a javascript object through an event got a reference this causes to leak memory as it fails to free up the cycled for small simple apps you may not for you might have to work around the for example by indirecting every event handler through a lookup so there is no direct reference from the dom object to the real event

would suggest not spending your time trying to implement an ssl function in your you could just use an existing which creates an ssl tunnel in front of your existing socket your you could tell the ssl tunnel to listen on port 443 and forward all decrypted packets to port 80 for your custom it will just see decrypted are plenty of free apps that do just google for

would suggest running the process as a scheduled task if you and writing a service only if you need services are quite a bit more difficult to write and if running your process on a schedule of any much better off using the windows scheduler than attempting to build a scheduler of your own the windows task scheduler is more efficient than your scheduler will windows task scheduler offers a number of options that you almost certainly attempt to but may find useful later you build a have to recompile the program if you want to change the logic that determines what conditions to run the task if you use the you just flip some options and are done with trying to decide between the then obviously using the task scheduler is a viable and if using the task scheduler is a viable then building a service is almost certainly the wrong	
	
would suggest something like the this code could be improved by adding support for detecting intermediate class hierarchy types that have a dispatch mapping and calling the nearest dispatch method based on the runtime it could also be improved by using reflection to detect overload of and adding them automatically to the dispatch public class a public class b a public class c b public static class private static readonly new static x x x public static void this a instance instance private static void a instance private static void instance private static void public class public static void var instancea new var instanceb new var instancec new

would suggest you try and make your mysql environment and you environment to both use a universal datetime format rather than a localised then you can use to use a reliable format at all from that you should be able to pass your dates to your database as date typed parameters rather than as a string and therefore it will handle the underlying conversion for i use sqlserver though not mysql so i know if you get the same

would thank my lucky stars that sql server have oracle packages we need a way to take all these procedures and put them in one i make developers create and maintain two files for each they will love us long as ms never implements packages like oracle be a win in my for packages are simply a way to organize your stored procedures packages so that you have 100 stored procedures sitting but maybe 5 not stackable like packages in java or all packages are at the same package requires two the headers file and the body this creates frustration when adding new procedures to an existing because you cannot add the body without adding the even though it contains the exact same information as is in the here is a snippet from the header file of one of my procedure in out the corresponding procedure in the procedure in out the header file is useless and is simply another hurdle for the developer to step over when developing with on my we have a convention that all the commented documentation for each procedure goes in the along with the details of when it was added and by but that could just as easily be included in the

would you handle i have taken ownership of an existing app and database that was written in the database design is fairly meaning the main tables are fairly wide and developers have continued to tack on additional columns to the end of the this has resulted in columns that have a lot of nulls since they directly relate to the primary am considering splitting the main table out as a way to abstract myself from the years and years of i am certain that new fields will continue to be added as new requirements come the question as new fields are do you continue to grow the width of the existing or do you stop extending an existing table and split it out into a separate supporting table that will house new thereby creating a if you were to split the main what would your assume for this example i have a table called with 150 is a good name for the new the there are views and stored procs that will need to be modified to support any new but that is inevitable anyway when columns are in advance for any to handle column growth of flat

xml data is not valid xml the backslashes should be forward for	
	
xml document can only have a single root i suggest you have a root element with elements under note that you still be able to append new elements within the same file have to read the existing file and rewrite in theory you just overwrite the last line always know how long it will so you could just seek to the right but more robust to read the file into append a new and then write out the whole document also think a bit strange to have the element the subject suggest a structure like second email comes here	
	
xml is a text format and images are usually not some ancient and archaic there is no really sensible way to do looking at things like odt or ooxml also shows you that they embed images directly into you can is convert it to base64 or similar and embed it into the whitespace handling may further complicate things in such

xpath though not very the right the transformation is run with saxon the result problem seems to be that this is an xslt it need to and you seem to be trying to run it within a browsers do not support xslt solution is to simply change the version to also need the xml schema namespace for this if the structure of the provided xml document is not going to a more efficient xpath expression using the abbreviation causes the whole starting at the top element node to be will be the all these together we get the following it produces the wanted	
	
xslt needs to declare the same namespaces as the xml file perhaps your ns2 declaration is slightly different between the two be especially careful about things like the case of letters and trailing slashes and the the namespace strings must match that perhaps you could post a complete xml and xslt file that demonstrates the problem cooper

you a better choice may be to change the function to take either an iterator to an element or a brand new vector it does not you can do this sort of things with arrays since you know how they are probably a bad idea to do the same with does not have the type while the stl implementation is available usually risky to try and rely on the internal structure of an	
	
you able to tell which elements you need to remove based on the elements themselves instead of the if and you want to change the existing list instead of creating a newly filtered a is more efficient than removing elements one at a time each element is only moved also if the predicate is obvious

you add parenthesis to the end of a function you execute that when you assign a function pass it as a parameter to another you need to omit the parenthesis as that is the way to retrieve a function pointer in you will also need to move the declaration of the function above the assignment of that function to the onsubmit event like this catch return if the function is not used elsewhere you can declare the function as an anonymous function like return seems a bit cleaner to

you are just processing rows as you it be better to just select the top n primary key values into a temp table table tempid int not null primary key int not int not into top n from keys should not change very often but other columns can with no harm to doing it this the of the insert and you can do a easy loop on tempid where it will be from 1 to join to your mykeys table and be on your with no need to duplicate all the runs fine on my sql server where is an identity create empty temp from mytable left outer join mytable m2 on where into top 1 from from with no create empty temp from mytable left outer join mytable m2 on where insert into select top from what is your real why do you need to loop while inserting into this temp you may be able to shift strategy and come up with a much better algorithm

you are scaling down by a factor of each 4x4 block of pixels in your original image will correspond to a single pixel in your output you can then loop through each 4x4 block in the original image and then reduce this to a single a simple way not the best to do this reduction could be to take the average or median of the rgb should note that you cannot do image scaling without losing image quality unless for all the blocks in the original each pixel is the exact same colour is	
	
you are sharing even an int across threads in a you need proper memory barriers in this can mean using interlocked instructions interlockedincrement in win32 for or using a language that makes certain with cpu level and caches and other unless you have those assume anything shared across threads is one thing you can assume with most architectures is that if you are dealing with properly aligned single you end up with a single word containing a combination of two values that were mashed if two writes happen over top of each one will and the other will be if you are you can take advantage of and see that either or are in the single reader

you are using flexbuilder the idea is that you will create a project that has a single thing to be built file repository you mentioned you is definitely a must have for build tools such as personal and in popularity and ability pretty to your toolbox allow you to do more advanced building even these types of tools will allow the building of a large application with many aspects and dependencies in a single this is a must for applications and development for larger projects with a lot of i will often have a single project that is little more than a build script that calls build scripts and puts everything maven is particularly good at there are eclipse that help out with both of those situations require different ways to use the projects it may be helpful to directly link to a library project as a that way your projects are able to debug the linked code and modify it as or if library projects are less commonly modified then their assets could be dropped into the folder of the dependant project eliminating the need to have the generating project open while development goes your projects to a situation goes a long way to keeping it generally i have a folder for each client and in there a folder for each if that project needs to be broken down into then all of those will be located in that project folder matter what the relationship is to each it is of course helpful to have a number of assets be created for a single this could be multiple for different different for distribution to different places or clients or a dozen other projects are sometimes a good example of sometimes i have a that is just my collection of i normally access this project from within flexbuilder and it normally have the and other eclipse

you are using local accounts just copying the acls will not because the sids will be different on the different would work this in several get the account sids on old and new the quickest way is using psgetsid psgetsid translates sids to names and vice mark for get the sddl descriptor definition a way of writing acls in described on of the files you win32 and have methods to do but the simplest route is powershell added line breaks to make structure string substitutions can be applied for each machine new machine on this set the new acl on the folder the best route to do this for multiple files is to script with a script on the old machine doing 1 and generating a script to do 3 and 4 on the destination machine avoid setting an acl with unknown sids

you ask about an you can just easily get a pointer to its so it basically boils down to the question whether pointers can be used transparently with stl a pointer actually is the most powerful kind of an there are different only forward and and only only forward and and only only and forward and and access arbitrary steps forward and backward in one and each iterator in the second group supports all the things of all iterators mentioned before a pointer models the last kind of iterators a random access you may an arbitrary integer and you may read and and all except the output iterator has a that can be used to access a member of the element type we iterate iterators have several typedefs as what the iterator iterates over reference to the pointer to the what type the distance between two iterators has by this is a it is typedefed to a type that represents the kind of the either algorithms can use it to overload on different kinds of iterators is faster for random access because it can just return a pointer of course does not have those has an template and specializes it for so if you want to get the value type of any you whether it is a pointer or some other it will give you the of that a pointer can very well be used with stl as someone else even can be a a pointer is a very good example of an iterator because it is so exceedingly simple but at the same time so powerful that it can iterate over a

you both threads to see the results of changing the private or is it perfectly ok with you if both threads get the but when one thread changes a private the other thread see that why i in your you could take the object from cache and then clone or copy it before returning as a each thread would have its own copy of the and that copy would have the state that was in the cached object at the time they asked for no 2 threads would ever share the exact same because making a copy for each that fits your then you can avoid having to lock the object will need synchronization on the factory method itself though which you also need in your current careful with the idea of a if you have a graph of objects and you only do a shallow wind up with references that are still shared across forcing you to need synchronization this idea of makes best sense if the object is a very simple object without a lot of references to other

you can do it is a fine practice which must however be considered strongly with respect to the careful not to call methods in the class during the call your class is partially so any call to methods the class itself or could have bad and hard to track as a rule of the constructor must be with respect to the you are using methods of the you have free access to its ask yourself i want to access the class through its or through its better explain the second suppose you have a class a with methods and that calls in its in this case you are talking with the interface of your this interface could not be the one you for suppose that the class has been reimplemented derived from by but also by an user of your and that method has been due to the will call instead of not using the method and accessing the you are guaranteed that your function behaves the even for child of these issues enter in the base class here is very good about	
	
you can do something know about other	
	
you can do this is not specific to you just need to know the sql code for creating columns and removing and put that sql into your is your you should be doing it is another generally you be modifying database or table structure at run time only during installations or for if what you need to achieve is allowing custom fields to be created for user profile or something like then modifying the table structure at runtime is not the what you would do is have a separate table containing all of the custom and a table containing all of the values along with the field id and the user that would be the proper way to normalise yes it does involve three tables instead of but it is better than having columns all in one for and modifying that structure at	
	
you can do this without the database being live then it should be important things to bear in mind are making sure that you have all the constraints that none of them will be affected by the change in column type if they are that you have mitigated for and that you are clear on the dependencies between those guess just make sure you have a clear process and that you follow

you consider jbosscache as an alternative to jbosscache has distributed transactions and is for it has replication mechanisms which can allow you to use udp or tcp	
	
you consider the notifier object not to be part of the model object which owns so that modifying the notifier as modifying the then make getnotifier a const method returning a const const but returns a to allow observers to return will then have to either mark as or else own it by pointer smart or reference rather than by either you avoid a it is usually preferable to embed objects rather than to but if this is a case where a notifier considered part of the model which uses then embedding is not owning it by reference forces you to initialize the reference when model is which leads to dependency which is no bad owning by smart pointer means as with you have to do anything about may be other ways to design things as addition of another but your comment because it needs to return a suggests to me that you can do exactly what you originally you just realise you	
	
you considered data this allows you to perform linq queries over a rest api by but the tooling does all the heavy of the standard linq filters are and can be for data services should be fine for data you need to do more work use a api for i have a series of on my covering this for work should be similar for other linq

you could figure out a different system which does not require modifying files like i suspect you have deployables committed to source i would include only source code for your projects as well as assemblies that your projects reference in source i would ignore your and should be able to check out the latest any from source setup external factors for their environment a set execute the build and have a fully functioning keeping the latest or in directly is not necessary to having a project and might not be such a good	
	
you could load your log into emacs you have sufficient and use the various emacs features such as incremental search and i tried this on files	
	
you could make apache parse for a certain folder adding the following to your you could set a file of php to parse the request the way chaos was recomending you and doing a certain then just return jpeg headers along with the correct picture like to display an picture for error let me know if you want a more extensive	
	
you could simply add commands to automatically copy the required dlls into the correct output as part of the build this is done in visual studio by going to the myprojectname build the commands to copy the files you need into the and option would be to simply set the current working directory of your project running it from within visual studio to be the directory in which all the dlls you need still have to manually copy the files when executing the program but it will make development a little	
	
you could try something like for attr in if return raise would call it like will try to call the methods in the order they are in in the if you wanted to pass any you could just pass them along after the list like	
	
you could use just you must use enum foo until you provide a typedef for when you refer to you do not use but just all enumeration constants share the same foo baz foo return with a enum foo baz return	
	
you could use the and create a factory that hands out only one instance your then the implementation is not a singleton and you can unit test it to your hearts only drawback is that you are not protected by the language to create your own instance if you retrieve it from the in you may overcome this by making the constructor private and the factory and the unit test i am not sure if has a similar	
	
you could use the it has a

you create an index on a column or number of columns in ms sql server using version you can specify that the index on each column be either ascending or having a hard time understanding why this choice is even using binary sort a lookup be just as fast either what difference does it make which order i server indexes ascending or what difference does it	
	
you create table summaries with column for each of you could index that with assigning different weight to each need you can use sqlite which has the the indexing built	
	
you decide on the header that you make available several or some combination for the public always a good idea to have at least one separate header for the private need to expose the prototypes of the functions and classes or the definitions that are only intended to be used	
	
you decide to do it using a good opensource library for a screenshot of an application using	
	
you decide to use an i can recommend having a look at lightspeed by mindscape because i think it the of your lightspeed you poco classes from a database using their command line tables or columns in but retain the old name in the linq that is efficiently translated to many different database	
	
you declare database names with a variable in that what trying to going to need to wrap your statements within an so have something database or execute the sql	
	
you dim color1 that implicitly defined color1 as an integer because what i suggest your own benefit and that of anyone reading your that you use to explicitly define the type of your looks like trying to use the same color1 variable to contain both the integer and enumerated version of your going to get quite confusing because enumerated values can also be directly converted to and from integers if you explicitly force that to and then you know whether a particular value represents your own color coding system or the i suggest that you create a function that generates 1 of 4 random colors like as select case case return case return case return case return end use that function to initialize your random

you find for any reason change of or that the amount of work required for a system over a sprint is greater than the amount available then a problem with your fix is as you you take programmers from other areas and throw them onto the how well this works depends on the skills of that person and how different the problem domain but treating programmers as generic units that can be farmed out as needed is generally not a successful strategy for developing is still a scheduling problem	
	
you find you can always just create a new code file and copy in this when the project it will only allow you to have one main so if it disappeared at some you can just you might have picked a project type that does not compile down to an not sure these might be for but normally a project will not have a main

you going to need to decode the mp3s into pcm data there are a number of libraries that can do this for need to analyze the pcm data and do some signal processing on generating realistic lipsync data from audio is a very hard and wise to not try to tackle i like your idea of simply basing it on the one way you could compute the current volume is to use a rolling window of some size and compute the average power in the sound wave over that that at frame you compute the average power over frames where n is the number of frames in your to we can easily compute the power in a wave without having to take the fourier transform or anything complicated the average power is just the sum of the squares of the pcm values in the divided by the number of frames in the you can convert the power into a rating by dividing it by some base power can be 1 for taking the and multiplying by	
	
you guarantee this locality of allocating a byte or using a mapped byte buffer from the you could get a chunk of contiguous from which you can decode the data you want deserializing the objects of interest from this chunk of if you repeatedly access the same the deserialization overhead would likely defeat the	
	
you guys were in essence correct on the content type but there was an underlying bug in my code that caused i had created a called which was called whenever there was a the problem is that i broke the i forgot to add to the end of my because of the request never got forwarded to the and therefore nothing was returned to the including any mime and the browser then tried to save the content onto my file

you have a usual pointer then the destructor will not be called memory for a instance will not be freed unless you do explicitly in if you want automatic destruction look at smart pointers like	
	
you have a very straight forward method signatures methods that takes and returns primitive types such as it is reasonably easy to do so in and still possible but a bit harder in java with if your class methods uses modern programming techniques such as boost shared pointers and stl containers then it is a very different you will need to be really careful with memory management in this is gonna be even more interesting if the method has template arguments because template system is very different from or java generics in that it is only a compile time basically this means the signature of the method or class is different every time you pass a different data type to the template this made the method impossible to wrap in or	
	
you have a visual studio biztalk project you can choose generated and then the dropdown list choose formed if no one used that option before you must run a script to activate see link will now generate the kind of schema you you will have to adjust data types if vs guessed wrong this sample generated

you have access to the script you could add at various parts in the script to try to see what specific line is that is the way i trouble shoot there are more elegant ways to do the debugging but it is quick and just remember to remove them if phase 2 shows up before the error message that means the problem is after phase 2 but before phase space out the msgboxes between your once you isolate the area you can then be very specific about the location of the msgboxes and find the exact line that is causing the

you have an instance of c why do you need to be a class not only is it bad its usually not someone on the net is bad because it creates the impression that some instance variables in the object are but this the page 484 of notes that you can call the method either way and it will be exactly the same as long as you pass the same instance	
	
you have another column in your table to aggregate the ip should not have only one integer per record without any other group do db do you

you have foo foo return call it foo but the problem is that now is a dangling because the temporary object created by the call to gets freed after bar the detailed execution sequence here foo is is called with a reference to the temporary returns the that bar has returned the temporary foo is reference is now dangling as the object was if you had foo declared return your call not be accepted by when you pass a temporary object to a you can only take it by const reference or as a this is part of the language	
	
you have here is an arbitrary and to parse it what you really want is a lexer you can write a grammar file that described your syntax and then use the lexer to generate a recursive parser from your a lexer even a recursive is not really trivial although it is a useful exercise in programming but you can find a list of ruby in this email message is available as a standard module of ruby so i suggest you concentrate on that even if its manual is not really easy to follow and it requires familiarity with	
	
you have looks pretty standard the only thing i would change is that the event name would be rather than following microsofts convention you would end up with something more like void somethinghandler void if as a cool trick you can add an empty delegate to your event so that you have to check the event for null before you raise void somethinghandler something delegate void	
	
you have more than one unix you probably want to have one set of passwords and one set of accounts across all of depending on which kind of unix this you may want to use nis or or some other solution to keep passwords centrally

you have the following code do else if do something else this state should never be assume that the applications logic dictates that in this part of the the last state should never be but it is not something that can be determined at compile and maybe there are other states which could be set by other parts of the but which are not used code do you add in the last no because it should not be reached some logging so that you as a developer know that some illegal state has been an because the state must not be reached and if it is reached something else must be first option seem reasonable to something goes right seems hardly the right option two has the advantage that your app crash right so if this happens in a rare occasion which was not caught in the customer can continu using the application and the developer is notified of the option three causes the app to which obviously is not something you want your customers to but it does make it very clear that something is is the best way to handle such a based on additional consideration to steer the contract of the method that contains the above code does not allow any other values to be set at that moment then on and that the code is in a part of the to handle an invalid execution	
	
you have the luxury of being able to scan the entire input before starting to compress you could choose the least frequent value in the input as your escape given this could choose as your escape value even if part of your symbol and adopt a convention whereby the first character of the encoded stream is the escape so the string above might encode even note that no point in encoding a of two identical values because the version is longer than the uncompressed version that	
	
you have the you can sacrifice memory in order to improve the const unsigned handled return this table would consume at least 4 gb gb if we leave the return type as this is an example of trading one limited resource for another your function needs to remain portable and run as fast as possible at any this would be the way to in most a 4gb table is

you have your but i just wanted to add that i think this is the most significant limitation of stemming from the fact that it is a would like to see some extension to that declares a function to be that it has no that are not denoted by the the idea would be that a function is pure only if it references other of this would only be useful if it were then possible to require that a delegate passed as a function parameter references a pure	
	
you havea a specifc defintion of when the week starts that is differnt that the standard used by the i think a weeks table is the solution to your for each year create a table that defines the dates contained in each week and the week then by joining to that table as well as the relevant other you can ask for just the data for week

you know how many object be adding very difficult to come up with an optimal all you can do is try to minimize the cost that you know is happening which in this case is that your vector is being constantly could do this in two split your operation into building and this is where you build the list into a vector that is guaranteed to be big enough and when done copy it to another enough for 1000 add when your vector is full call reserve with enough for another set of alloc space for 16 more could choose a different container that did not result in all elements being copied upon a but your bottleneck may then become the individual memory allocations for the new	
	
you know that the div is going to have text in you can count the div can have html tags in going to have to traverse its children looking for text ret var length i i var node ret 1 return words count is the same logic that the jquery library uses to achieve the effect of its jquery is a pretty awesome library that in this case is not if you find yourself doing a lot of dom manipulation or ajax then you might want to check it noted by gumbo in the the way we are splitting the strings above would count two consecutive spaces as a if you expect that sort of thing even if you probably best to avoid it by splitting on a regular expression instead of on a simple space keeping that in instead of doing the above you should do something like count only difference being on what passing to the	
	
you know that your code uses as you i would go for a trivial do not underestimate the power of the asterisk in vim as well a search of the word you have under your cursor in the albeit this is limited only to the file you are currently solution you could implement is to have a very good testsuite and then wrap the routine with a deprecation if you get the deprecation it means that the routine was so still used this works even for reflection but of course you can never be sure if you trigger the situation when your routine call is	
	
you know the lengths of the lines in there is no shortcut for finding the place of the that unless you use a readily implemented function for splitting the but that would probably just do the same thing somewhere down the you have to loop through the chars

you know the width in then your only possible answer would depend on staging your output in a temporary buffer of some for small just collecting the data and deferring output until the input is bounded would be large an intermediate file may be required if the collected data exceeds reasonable memory you have the then it is simple to it into a report using the idiom for each if the output channel permits random you could just go ahead and write a draft of the report that assumes a default and seek back and edit it any time your width assumption is this also assumes that you can pad the report lines outside that field in some innocuous or that you are willing to replace the output so far by a process and abandon the draft unless you can predict the correct width in it will not be possible to do what you want without some form of

you mean by smart then that is actually called smart quotes are when you type and but get and or and automatically depending on the not sure how you would use smart quotes in awk or the such as are used to evaluate a command and substitute the result of the command within them into the shell expression being it can be used to compute and argument to another or to set a for less you can instead use which makes a lot of quoting rules easier to work the and are also is used for strings in which you want variable substitution and escape represents a string containing just the characters within the with not variable interpolation or escape for echo echo echo echo echo echo echo scripting such as perl and have similar though there may be slight

you mean you want the second textbox to display something which depends on in the first but only if the user did set it you be more specific about what you are trying to it seems to me that your ui design may be confusing for the since the text in b is sometimes related to and sometimes you still want to do the typical way to go is to use an updating as proposed in other	
	
you mentioned you already tried position but tried the following and it might work for here is the 0 the menu is positioned independent of the other ie puts the menu relative to the and hides it behind the the work around is to position it just as many to the left as the content div has but this should only done for so therefor the 0 is added before the negative which works because ie ignores while the other browers do acknowledge it and will use alohci notes a better way would be to use the in that case the css for html

you open the files in notepad or any plain text the form sizes are defined a few lines from the clientheight clientleft clienttop clientwidth am not sure why you are encountering the issue seems strange but if your build server is causing an then the only options i see are changing your build server upgrading the video card or writing in the code in the load event for each form as you although that may have an effect on centering of the form if you have the set in the ide so verify that your forms are still centered if that is your desired	
	
you pointed out its always important what the program should do if the file is in all my applications the user can always delete the config file and the application will create a new one with default no i also ship my applications without config users tend to delete files and even files they should not delete like serial keys and template i always check for these files because without them the application is unable to run at i can not create a new serial key from should happen when the file is you can do a file find or exception handler but the real question is what will happen when the file is or how important is the file for the i check all the time before i try to access any support files for the additional i do error handling if the file is corrupt and can not be

you really do insist on this function prototype not following the other suggestions here of passing an array or a list which are you can use something like that bool can be used to access the ith print the 4th change the value of the the if you really need to change the passed you should not pass them by passing a bool by reference only wastes time and it would also make the code here a bit less	
	
you really need is a pop up that lets the user enter criteria about the part and do the query against the or part partial part a single combo box field is likely not enough to let the user express they about the part so they can narrow down the part number compared to a form with several pop a modal picker with user specified filter put a little magnifying glass or whatever next to the field to pop it have the form come up blank with no results at then the user can narrow stuff

you rewrite you current code so that it can be unit tested according all guidelines and that can be and you should estimate the cost and compare that the earnings is that you might discover a problem with the code and if done the reduction of the complexity as the result of the factors might save some time in the cost is the time and effort you have to spend both refactor your the test cases and also the extra time you might have to spend in the maintain the and the mocking code and that can be significant are comparing a known cost against a future risk and i am sure a lot of smart guys knows how to do but obvious that you can actually spend an infinite time refactoring and mocking without ever reducing the risk of failure to zero even at all if the code and problem is complex and you are messing things up when so you need to find a balance this as the code is it might be ok to be or and do black box testing or testing and just test the interface without bothering to mock the and you can argue that this is not a unit test but instead a system test or a function test it might give the best value for your money or your money or more time with your significant other at least more time to watch discovery you have old allow black box allow dependencies between the tests and compile a sequence of test that sets up the test data and manipulates and its at least tested automatically while not tested

you want curved you can use which are mathematically defined curves specified by two vector you plop down the and then solve for a nice curve between a search should reveal source code or math that you can derive into source the nice thing about this is that you can solve for the heading of your vehicle as well as get the next location on your path by doing a percentage the difficult thing is that you have to do a curve length calculation if you want the same number of steps between each set of alternate approach is to use a hidden bitmap with the path drawn on it as a single pixel wide you can find the next location in the path by matching the pixels surrounding your current location to a and then updating the vector with a delta function at each we used this approach for a path traveling prototype where a was being along various paths using a and it works okay until you have some intersections that confuse your vector but if a unidirectional closed this would work just and dead simple to you can smooth out the heading angle of your vehicle by averaging the last few each pixel becomes one so your velocity control is the former you can have specially tagged endpoints for locations or points of in the just use a different color pixel on the path for special in either what you display will probably not be the underlying path but some prettied up representation of your pick whatever is and write a function that steps to the next path location and updates your vehicle heading whenever the car is in if really you can do some radius based collision handling so that cars will automatically stop when a car in front of them on the track has

you want to do in a unit test is make sure that the method does the job that it is supposed to if the method uses dependencies to accomplish you would mock those dependencies out and make sure that your method calls the methods on the objects it depends on with the appropriate this way you test your code in of the benefits to this is that it will drive the design of your code in a better in order to use for you naturally gravitate towards more decoupled code using dependency this gives you the ability to easily substitute your mock objects for the actual objects that your class depends you also end up implementing which are more naturally both of these things are good design patterns and will improve your order to test your particular for you might have your class depend on a factory to create connections to the database and a builder to construct parameterized sql commands that are executed via the pass these mocked versions of these objects to your class and ensure that the correct methods to set up the connection and build the correct execute and tear down the connection were or you inject an already open connection and simply build the command and invoke the point is your class is built against an interface or set of interfaces and you use mocking to supply objects that implement those interfaces and can record invocations and supply correct return values to the methods that you expect to use from the

you were pretty try t foobar2 public return foobar1 foobar2 fb2 issue you were having is that you were specifying the return type of as you should have it as just you want to do specific things for you can specialize the on return sounds like you are having issues with the compiler not finding the definition for your templated templates in are rather and the usual practice is to put the entire template implementation in a header you might try imagematrix public various functions t create a new instance of imagematrix and return find the gcc but on explicit template instantiation and it gives a bit of an idea of likely want to either include the implementation in the header as i suggested or call getrotatedcopy in the or else instantiate it explicitly in the see below for the reason this works differently from is that templates in unlike actually create a whole new for each different combination of template is a completely different class a different set of compiled than see for a better to the error going away when you use the that actually tell you since until you actually instantiate a not going to update going to you can only use it if the pointer is actually pointing to an instance of the class you are casting works similar to the operator in suspect that what you are wanting is the you start out with an instance of and want to use a base class method on and get back a new copy of try something along these t return imagefilter public imagefilter imagefilter otherfilter if you really do want to start out with an imagematrix and transform it into an have to add a constructor on imagefilter that takes an

you will not need to recompile for postgresql to take advantage of the additional will happen is that the linux scheduler will now be able to select two or more to postgresql to run all at the same basically they are working in parallel rather than having to wait on each other to get a slice of cpu this means you are able to process data faster since now four different queries can be processed at the same time rather than just the two you had has no further tuning required to take advantage of multiple and it is entirely up to the you basically improved your performance for the cost of a new you are looking for information on tuning your postgresql take a look at post on tuning postgresql on a dedicated you now have more processes able to run at the same you may also want to consider upgrading the amount of ram you have depending on what you currently have the more the database is able to be stored in memory the faster all of the transactions and queries will

your field you have an object of type this could be implemented by any number of different with what you are each implementation would have its own which would introduce any number of difficulties for nhibernate to simple example would help to say you have two iaddress implementations and they each are saved in their own and when you try to load your field all nhibernate knows is that you have something that implements it does not know which implementation was how would it know which mapping to use to retrieve the child object for any given sure there are more but this example shows why you have to have a mapping for the exact type of object that you have

your i would rather do something return an invalid handle in case of failure and a valid handle of i am assuming that the handle type is someway similar to what win32 api uses as for your pass output parameters by reference or by so the second you should make sure that the passed pointer is not usually with an null rest of the disadvantage of passing the output parameters as pointers is that you know for sure if the passed pointer is valid or not initialized or by reference is sometimes less readable when it comes to output result give a hint to the developer that myhandle is an output and some subtle problems may occur due to code i recomend to avoid as much as possible output because of the code if you really have no use references instead if the output parameter is
