a any attempt to slice and dice xml with regular expressions is a real xml parser would do break it 1 is it matches the of the attribute group which is embedded in group matches an attribute and may be repeated 0 or more 2 is most of these pieces are commonly the most unusual is which means repetition in regular the whitespace match at the end is important for without vim will try every possible way to split the whitespace between attributes between the at the end of group 2 and the at the beginning of the next occurrence of group 1 is followed by this is a positive it prevents the from being included in the matched text for 3 is it includes group which matches the beginning of the attribute the is a negative and matches any character this groups matches at any character except where the attribute group 3 is followed by a repetition marker so that it matches the smallest block of text before if you were to use instead of group the matched text could include the of an annotation element that did include match and continue through into the next annotation element with next bit is find match and a minimal number of other characters before the 5 is the end is a positive which is included here for the same reason as the for the we have to repeat rather than use because groups with modifiers

a base controller and have your controllers derive from set your start time in the constructor and override and put the calculation of the total time this should give you an on the entire life of the since controller implements assuming that the render engine will dispose it after the result is computed and you have to wait for garbage if my assumption turns out to be you could use to get the rendering time on the page would be relatively hard because by definition the page be done rendering until your time is put on the page and you have the time until the page is done you write the render time to the session then use ajax to come back and get the render time for display you might be able to approximate it by putting the start time in viewdata and calculating the rendering time in the view you might want to try logging the render time and doing the view approximation and see how close it code could be used to log the render class basecontroller private datetime starttime public starttime public override void bool disposing var totaltime write it out somewhere

a bit but for debugging you can turn on the this will allow you to set up your own error the easiest way to set up said error handling would be to override this will terminate your but it will there may be things you can do to make this not kill your but this will depend on what platform deploying this at any never use this in pretty much going to have to have extensive error handling in one technique used is something like def def print your own error return def raise you use as a decorator on your it will automatically handle whatever errors happened within function is called for some exceptions in but is not getting called for other errors like importerrors import thisclassdoesnotexist in new to is this because of some distinction between and all errors are the reason why this is causing problems is because these errors occur immediately when the module is imported before your view is ever the first method i posted will catch errors like these for you might be able to figure something out for but argue that you have worse problems if getting importerrors in a production app not doing any dynamic tool like can help you eliminate these kinds of problems	
	
a bit like your original approach in basic idea is to print everything delayed by one line the hold and pattern spaces printing is that needs to be done because until we check whether the next line matches the regexp we know whether to a newline or there is just a trick to make the last line it appends the last line into the hold buffer so that the final implicit print command outputs it

a hard comparison to make because differences in the respective stacks mean you end up doing the same thing differently and if you do them the same for the purpose of comparison not a very realistic which i is in its most basic form loaded with every interpreted and then it is very much like cgi in this respect is no surprise considering it is roughly 15 years over the years various optimisations have been made to improve the most notably opcode caching with for example much so that apc will be a standard part of php 6 and not an optional module like it is still php scripts are basically session information is file based and mutually exclusive blocks other scripts accessing the same user session until or the script whereas not the case in aside from session fairly easy to have objects that live within the application context in java for that which is much more similar is a key for database access in php is transient connections whereas will nearly always use persistent connection pools and build on top of this to create orm frameworks and the the caches for which are beyond any particular a bytecode interpreted is theoretically faster but the limits to what php can do are so high as to be irrelevant for most 4 of the top 20 visited sites on the internet are php for speed of cost of running the tend to be far more important when you start to scale than any theoretical speed in mind that has primitive type safety and these sorts of things that will make code faster than php can run if you want to do a somewhat unfair sort an array of one million random 64 bit integers in both will kill it because they are primitive types and simple arrays will be more efficient than associative arrays all arrays in php are associative plus php on a 32 bit os have a native 64 bit integer so will suffer hugely for should also be pointed out that is whereas php is interpreted opcode which can make a difference but the flexibility of php in this regard is a good being able to deploy a script without bouncing your server is just drop it in and it but it is less performant though i think arguing really an irrelevant

a mistake to assume that learning c will somehow automatically give you a better understanding of programming in a lot of cases even c is too high level to give you a good understanding of efficiency classic is versus so perhaps most people know the implications about performance between these two but learning c magically teach you this by guess i understand arguments about when string operations are made deceptively people often use them in inefficient but knowing that strncat exists give you a full appreciation for the efficiency a lot of c programmers probably even thought about the fact that strncat has to do a strlen operation using important to understand going on behind the scenes if efficiency is a people who know c tend to view things in a assembly and machine code are the building blocks of while c is a building block of higher level specifically but obvious that c is to the than many higher level this has at least two efficiency concerns as hidden behind implicit and easier to screw you want a specific example of how knowing c gives you an i think there is i think what people when they say this is that knowing going on behind the scenes in whatever language happening to write for helps you make more intelligent decisions about how to write a mistake to assume that c is going on behind the in for

a side always avoid a broken tool and is only remotely useful if you use it with the even almost always better to use or a simple for or while is xargs so it splits input on meaning all your filenames that whitespace will cause it to be a and for which only leads to more headaches as you use it on filenames that quotes as part of the such as wanna miss a this will just make xargs puke and curse at you that you quoted its input you it should just learn that do not belong in input they belong in shell and xargs has no business trying to parse do the whitespace splitting or the quote parsing when you pass to it does the which is use null bytes to delimit but that means you need to give it input that uses null filenames as which brings us back better to just use bar

a system developing i have a choice of either using a single stored procedure that does three related jobs and returns either no or the same result but sourced from two different read an article yesterday that suggested that a should only have one execution plan and that any procedure that changes execution plan depending on a difference in parameters should probably be written as multiple the procedure as three different procedures would change how the system that executes the procedures operates but not in any significant like to know is whether the performance gained from having procedures that have different execution plans depending on inputs vs a single procedure is worth the effort is the overhead of calling the database three times greater than the overhead of having to recompile the performance plan depending on server individual procedures single

abstract class is useful when you need a substantial amount to be identical across the for example in cart with multiple methods of payment you an abstract class which defines a generic payment subclasses inherit from the superclass for each actual you want to support credit of how a payment is authorized would be different for but they all perform essentially the same function that a user can prove that they can pay for the goods in example of where an interface is useful is where you have that need to provide some similar functionality in a for you might have a cms where articles are stored in but where the system caches them to disc as well as until the article in the database is at which physical file is deleted until the next time someone access in the your cms might also support the ability to upload etc to be stored for access on the you definitely want these files to be deleted as the copy disc represents the file itself and not a cached in you could create a cacheable interface that says what methods which is cached to disc needs to while leaving it the class itself to implement this makes more sense that represent different kinds of data almost certainly implement their caching scheme class that allows caching would be defined as class which is something you can then check for less experienced coders might test the class of an are working with by getting the class and processing the a big switch this the correct approach means that assuming that certain classes objects and if you add a new class to the system to modify every switch statement in your software to take it if yo uimplement an interface you can test if an that interface with the instanceof instanceof manage approach is better because it eliminates the switch statement makes your software easier to if you add a new the system that also implements its own caching scheme then need to declare that it implements as the all classes to implement it to declare the methods the interface you can be sure that any class that will provide certain methods for you to your need to know how the class implements these just does implement concepts are somewhat trickier to explain than to actually use hopefully got the basic ideas across for you to figure them out for kumar

achieve that you need to change the control template of the treeviewitem using the itemcontainerstyle of the treeview is the style that gets applied to any item in the root of the default treeviewitem is not so it does not extend all the way to the you set the it is inside the treeviewitem and so cannot extend past will not post the whole style because it would be way too what to do in your right click and chose control a save the style wherever you in the expand the stuff and locate the which is a change its rowspan property to set the property of your item to on the item or through the style if you need to apply that to several item should now be the correct this only applies to the item you if you want that to work for any item you add to the you need to change the of the treeview to the newly created and remove the style that blend placed on the but not you need to set the itemcontainerstyle of your treeviewitem to that same style so that its children also extend all the and so on and so in the with your example and a child node on the first is the style that blend created for the full style as generated by blend and it is long because it basically is a copy of the style with minor

actually what you do is to deal with conditional is when a get request does go from client to asking you have anything newer than and the server say 304 if do avoid the server generating the and the traffic of the js however the cost of the request is sending an http request from browser to is still stuff is being handled by the headers for one for the etag is a different thing that is when the browser decides not to issue the get request at it is being managed by the header or the might have a header being setup somewhere and it makes the client disregard the setting or something like and see if the request is being cached about fb instead setup a breakpoint or logging on the server to be sure that not being said that when dealing with files you might not actual that is because if the browser does decide to say for a then you cannot force it to reload a new so if you deploy a new version to the the client see it until the week has no matter what the new time of the new resource is cuz it will never even issue the conditional get solution you really want to relieve network is to setup caching for maximum time a and when the resource you change the uri is add an arbitrary querystring this will force the browser to reload the new js and never bother the server at least until the next update next resource uri	
	
add a field to your users table to store the currently used session this id is easily accessible from your when the user logs store that every page check to verify that the current session id matches what was stored in your user if it then clear the current session data and kick the user back to the log in will not stop the user from using multiple tabs in ie 7 because ie7 uses the same instance for each but it will stop them from using multiple browser reason why this will work is that each browser contains own cookie are matched up server side based on a cookie value that stores the session id and is sent back to the server on each this is not a very effective means of eliminating session which it sounds like the security audit is trying to if you need to do update your question and go way to stop session hijacking is to store a random number in the session and as a cookie on the when the next request comes verify that the cookie and session values if they then reset the session id variable in your user this will force all sessions to log in for every page request create a new random the downside is that pages can not be but probably

advise against c and qt and would also recommend your background in pascal and probably javascript feel much more comfortable with done a lot of coding in pascal and where pascal guides you to avoid programming c lets you step right even invites and then have a hard time figuring out why it went qt is a very abstract framework and requires you to learn a lot before you can get something just like with when compared to the easyness we used to have with tp back is much more like pascal in this and its ide is quite modern in regards to supporting your with an gui editor to fill in the gaps for handling ui code when you get into huge program rb loses some of its appeal because it is missing tools to give you a good overview of complex class interactions thing is that qt is more likely to cause mac apps than rb rb visually guides you to get it all aligned nicely in qt you have to work with to position your objects least it was that way when i used qt 2 years written quite a few apps in rb and am pretty happy with the probably write those looking apps that compete with the best on the open small business but if you just want to get some solid code with an ui acceptable to the average give rb a not but its rather small community is on your side eager to instead of bashing everyone trying to talk sense

after my post i think i am being a little bit unclear about what the problem let me try to can leave comments on my site using a textarea field in a it should be possible to add line breaks in the comment using the comment is then stored as a string in a to make it and later on retrieved from the database and displayed on the regular line breaks are not recognized when the comment is can edit their and in that case the original comment is displayed in a textarea field to be modified image the problem is that if there are any the code is not valid as xhtml error message i make the code valid using any other type of line as stated in the regular line breaks in combination with does not work breaks are displayed in the textarea but not when the comment is displayed as normal text on the have a which includes a textarea field to leave and i want it to be able to add line breaks using below is a simple works as however it does not validate as xhtml transitional when using the w3c validation this is the error i line column document type does not allow element element named above was found in a context where it is not this could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements such as a element in the section instead of inside or two elements that overlap is not common cause for this error is the use of xhtml syntax in html due to rules of implicitly closed this error can create cascading for using tags for and in the section of a html document may cause the parser to infer the end of the section and the beginning of the section and are not hence the reported there a way to make the line breaks valid or do i need to find a workaround using specific tags for line breaks in the textarea field and then replacing them with later on when displaying the to add line breaks in a textarea field while keeping it xhtml

agree with mitchel and casperone an exception makes the most far as unit testing is junit4 allows you to exceptions would need only to pass parameters which are guaranteed to cause the and add the correct annotation to the junit test as tom martin junit 4 is a step away from junit it possible to also test exceptions using junit just not as of the ways tested exceptions is by using a block within the class and embedding statements within a simple example not complete regionmodel is assumed to be but it should get the idea void int originalsize int index int numberofregionstoremove than current try since the exception will immediately go into the block this code will only run if the illegalargumentexception not catch but regionmodel was catch exception	
	
agree with that the process id should be stored instead of a process ids are not reused until after a so this should be recommend against using the tmp environment variable for and instead look at this would be more oriented in terms of it would lower the security required to run your both temporary directories and isolated storage will persist after a so need logic to handle that app can clean out the info on you have access to the code of process you are it might be better to use something like named pipes or shared memory to detect whether the application is this also gives you a much cleaner way to shut down the killing a process should be a last resort in i build an application where the design requires killing a process if it was at all

agree with you want the constness of the pointer to be at the call better way to do what you are looking for is to have your function return a const reference to the return definition references be so be better course this work if your function is attempting to a myclass in that case you can just move the extra const to the call function return new love use of a const pointer to a myclass which is const myclassinstance	
	
agree with your and with noticed that a significant amount of the friction i encounter when refactoring can be attributed broadly to inheritance of state i avoid such things and in fact implementation inheritance is very often the quickest way to get to a green but i believe it comes with a so i like to get rid of it as soon as i see methods are one a hint that the superclass has too many responsibilities and the subclasses are likely to be coupled to its internal rather than to its external the whenever i see any method less than public i ask myself whether it indicates a need to split the the answer is just enough of the and no harm in asking the

agree you want to lock display modal in the gui when the concurrency i think can be really frustrating for a user when they know why it is think keeping the gui responsive if there was no and then when a conflict is when you receive the response from your other you correct the i like the effect to let the user know that their operation has been perhaps with status bar similar unobtrusive message to explain the reverted you can add some messaging when operations you could provide some additional feed back in an unobtrusive that there is a potential for conflict with another

all about hamming distance between two values is the number of bits at which they so if you transmit but i receive then the number of bits which must have been switched in transmission is the hamming distance between a and codes are useful when the bits in each code word are transmitted somehow we care whether serial or but they for instance combined into an analogue value representing several or after each bit is independently random with some fixed either received or assuming the transmission is fairly most bits are received so errors in a small number of bits are more and simultaneous errors in large numbers of bits are a hamming code usually aims to correct to detect errors the wikipedia article for details of the two main codes which bigger errors can be but afaik used as code works by evenly spacing out the code points in which in mathematical terms is the metric space consisting of all values of the relevant word with hamming distance as the imagine that each code point is surrounded by a little of invalid if a value is received that a code then an error must have because only valid code points are ever a value in the buffer zone is then the assumption that a error the value which was transmitted must be distance 1 from the value but because the code points are spread there is only one code point that so to that code on grounds that a error is more likely than the greater error that would be needed for any other code point to produce the value in probability the conditional probability that you sent the nearby code point is greater than the conditional probability that you send any other code given that i received the value i so i guess that you sent the nearby with a certain confidence based on the reliability of the transmission and the number of bits in each an invalid value is received which is equidistant from two code then i say that one is more likely to be the true value than the so i detect the but i correct errors are not corrected by a secded hamming the received value is further from the value you actually than it is to some other code and i erroneously it to the wrong so you either need transmission reliable enough that you care about or else you need error detection as well a crc over an entire

alleviate your doubt in the original is indeed a reference the thing to remember is that what you are doing to the array and what you are doing to the string are not the new string to new array the array you are are changing the data in piece of memory for the string you are creating a new string at a new memory and making point to that newly allocated is a different remains pointing at the original memory location where the characters are an aside because of the of string there is no way a change to will show up in any attempt to change the string as will create a new string in that

am everyone it a bit confused about exactly what the goal is so give three possible answers that may cover what you actually the relatively simple goal of getting the script to read from either a list of files on the command or from its regular 0 exec from this point the stdin is redirected from the supplied on the command the use of is the best way to avoid problems with funny characters in filenames and unquoted both mess this the trick using here is a it fires off cat in the background to feed data from files supplied on the command and then we use exec to replace the stdin with the output from that seem to be what you actually what you seem to really want is to pass the supplied filenames or the stdin to a command inside the this requires sort of the opposite converting the stdin into a file a named whose name can be passed to the like 0 command goes command goes uses to launder the stdin through cat to a named which is then passed to command as an stdin is taken from the i think what you want to but not quite what asked which is to redirect the stdin from the supplied files pass stdin to the command inside the this can be done by combining the above 0 exec goes i think why actually want to do

another way to look at assume you understand the concept of an array something that supports the operation of where you can get to the ith in one no matter how large a for if you want to store information about a group of people who all happen to have different a simple way would be to have an array that is large and use each age as an index into the thay you could have access to any of course there could be more than one person with the same so what you put in the array at each entry is a list of all the people who have that so you can get to an individual information in one step plus a little bit of search in that list a it only slows down if there are so many people that the buckets get then you need a larger and some other way to get more identifying information about the like the first few letters of their instead of using the basic instead of using any function of the person that produces a good spread of values can be the hash like you could take every third bit of the ascii representation of the scrambled in some all that matters is that you want too many people to hash to the same because the speed depends on the buckets remaining

appreciate some opinions on a concern i have a table in my with the basic stuff like application requires that i track a vast number of attributes for each so much that i will likely run out of columns storage tempted to add a userproperties table with propertykey and propertyvalue this approach fits well with the concern is that if each user has say 100 when the database has a million users in have property would think that with a clustered index on the that access will still be screaming and you are really storing about the same amount of data as you would with the ideas or thoughts on performance ideas for a better db thanks so much for all the great have been toying around with the and one thing keeps bothering i need to query on some of these attributes pretty and worse these queries could involve finding all users who match criteria on as many as 10 of these attributes at the same a i am now leaning towards the but possibly splitting the data off into one separate forming a relationship keyed on the using and while i think tables with this many columns are i think considering all the challenges and it is probably the right but i am still eager to hear other design	
	
approach does mean defining a unique set of values for each but this is for the other	
	
approach i would use for this would be to capture the split it into and printf the lines out next to each probably do it in rather than just use cal if your cal has	
	
approach is hooking all api calls and function calls to compare with table made from the thus you discovers what is is many api for one is api	
	
approach is the only sane option in this rule for optimization is not optimize unless you know exactly where the bottlenecks should still be able to swap your container relatively easily later especially if you use a type defined via typedef instead of directly using the stl i mean something myintvectortype	
	
approach notably in programming in the unix and network is to wrap calls with error checking code and then use the wrappers in the example for result error checking in full in calling way you get to show error handling while allowing the flow of calling code to be clear and

are a couple of the solution is simply to cast the ints to you can do the although you should use a a better idea is to use the overload base still has to be a but the exponent can be an int at prefix probably necessary compilers make the function available in the global namespace as to access the versions of the you have to include the version of the instead of you need to provides versions of every c using this naming if the c header is called the version will be when writing in you should always prefer these	
	
are a couple of ways this can be code running at does not need to be written in the same language as the it merely has to be able to be linked together with os virtually all languages can interoperate with which is really all there is technically no java functions can call c and c functions can call java and if the os written in c for the sake of argument that written in then the os code can call into some intermediate c which forwards to your and vice c is pretty much a of a program has been compiled native its source language is no longer assembler looks much the same regardless of which language the source code was written in before as long as you use the same calling convention as the no bigger problem is runtime not a lot of software services are available in the there usually is no java virtual for is no reason why there technically but but safe to assume that not in its as java a java program a lot of it needs the java vm to interpret and jit the and it needs the class library and so there are two ways around java in the this would be an unusual but it could be compile your java source code to a native a java program have to be compiled to java you could compile it to x86 the same goes for whatever class libraries you those too could be compiled all the way to of parts of the java class library requires certain os features that be but then use of those classes could be it can be but not and unclear what course another problem may be that java let you access arbitrary memory which would make a lot of hardware communication pretty but that could be worked around perhaps by calling into very simple c functions which simply return the relevant memory areas as arrays for java to work	
	
are a couple things you can do to find sexiness here does not have any ootb way to inject the properties of the through table into your contact a m2m table with extra data is a sql so django try to fight the nor guess what should happen in the event of namespace in go so far as to say that you probably do not want to inject arbitrary model properties onto your contact if you find yourself needing to do then probably a sign you should revise your model django provides convenient ways to access the relation both in queries and for data all the while preserving the integrity of the in this find that your object offers a property that you can use to access the through c would produce a list of contactphonenumbers objects for that in your to iterate of all contact phone numbers you contact in for phone in print you really want to do the injection for some see you can do that using the code sample immediately just change the print statements into assignment a separate just for future you could have written your inject function without sql in the through table is itself a so you can query it and then do the result use to get the phone and use to get the contact	
	
are a desktop software developer point of view to that of a web rich web application such as flash or look like better tools for doing wysiwyg text editors for the they are capable of more sophisticated data representation and they are consistent through the browsers and platforms maybe not silverlight and moonlight but at least flash seems to the developers prefer to go with with all their toiling diligently to work around every particular quirk and using numerous hacks to make these technologies do what they never originally supposed to be able to are some generally accepted arguments why you should not use flash for a as well as a generally accepted the embedded video how is a rich text editor flash control lives in isolated does a wysiwyg text of a flash control be indexed by the search who cares about indexing the ever changing unsaved content of an all users may have flash so not all of them may have javascript here the question what are the advantages of choosing javascript over flash for implementing a wysiwyg what would be the disadvantages of choosing there are no wysiwyg rich text editors in

are a lot of different network simulators dependant on how detailed you want to do your and what kind of network you want to and genesis are good if you want to simulate full biological networks geussing you probably even down to the behaviour of dendrites and split and some others are good for doing population simulations where you create the population on a basis and see what the whole population this is pretty much the standard and is used a lot in research and commercial so there are worth looking i know that ibm use split for some of their is good if you want to use differential equations to model what a population would but this approach is relatively new and computationally expensive very sure if that is exactly what you if you google any of the names in caps along with the word you will end up at the relevant web page

are a number of things that most frameworks although the definition is a basic bootstrapper setup check for compatability issues between php routing how to define rules for which urls point to which orm manipulate objects instead of writing sql queries usually involves creating a for template logic to avoid having php code in the template most frameworks also include a slew of libraries from simple to advanced web service would recommend two frameworks to look recommend this because a framework that works out of the it also has a great lots of 3rd party ci has a bit of trickery to get the framework to play nice with both php4 and which is also good to know for some a lot of people still use you should also take a look at which is a branch of codeigniter that has been rewritten as a strict php5 is a instead of dropping everything in a directory and churning out you pick the parts you need and glue them together since zend is made by the folks behind the engine behind php it uses latest and of php5 everything is and it uses type very clean if a bit think the essential stuff is the bootstrapper for the as well as how each framework implements a system to support libraries and the rest you can find as applications

are dbs useful storing such and how should be a database is useful for this you could implement your own data and perhaps it would be more efficient for your specific because you can design it for that a relational database is more but you can avoid weeks or months of development time by employing a answered another question earlier today on the subject of how to handle extensible where each new has its own distinct set of many kind of each product have many your i would choose the table now suppose the himself can specify the format of in a configuration the length of each its what its values mean case of and so how do extend a implementation assume the number of packet types are relatively and then many packets are inserted with pretty much the same so you should use the ability to manage i would define an additional table for each new packet would also store the packets so each field of the packet is stored in a separate database that way you can index each column to support efficient can also define constraints so that some fields are mandatory or their values constrained by lookup leveraging the capabilities to use metadata to enforce consistent structure where already supports a declarative language for specifying fields with data why develop a different language which you then have to translate to even more suppose the data packages can varying in length and that are optional in a given packet type should permit in the corresponding

are saying that you want to create a view and stick it in a library that shows only guessing you are accessing this stuff using a library list and not specifying a specific think it is possible using sql for the view to know current library when using a library if you using a library list then you should just be able to run your queries using the library that you am i you want to have a view that dynamically knows what schema it is in and uses that as part of the sql i think it is if you hardcode the query for the view to say where schema to the current library then it could but you would have to make a different version to put in every and it would not be obvious if it was ever wrong or if it was

are so many different java enterprise technologies pretty hard to know where to as previously the head first jsp servlets book is i currently work on an enterprise app that was made years ago with just we have migrated over to as time has gone on but we are not using any of the newer so it is for sure a valid way to do although thing about is that most enterprise development is a conjunction of a bunch of different for you could create an app using for the views with a servlet using hibernate for you db jdom for your junit for your testing log4j or aspectj for your logging lucene for jboss for deployment deployment can be pretty you going to go out and learn all of those technologies in the next 3 i would suggest is previously to pick a and there are many to choose from such as that will abstract away a lot of the underlying any java technology you pick will have a good community behind it willing to thing to since you seem to be in a hurry to get things is that my opinion at java is not a fast language to build things it is very verbose and unless you grasp the nuances of good java web design it is very easy to shoot yourself in the perhaps you should look at some of the other technologies that are available on the jvm that you have all the java libs such as allows you the ability to program with java syntax if you or a dynamic grails is pretty much a rails clone for groovy and will let you write a web app in no time at you choose to good luck and welcome to the wonderful world of java web

are the core principles and motivating forces behind the the extent that used mostly about code reuse and used it before in the guest user admin model and it certainly proves its value when you need to move a user from one group to extend this to having organizations and companies represented with users under and really providing a form of abstraction that particularly inherent in does it prescribe you do to your data bit above pretty high level and quite incorrect in some been on project that used but i working with a separate team on other pretty correct in your bit though it needs some more you can imagine a situation where an entity in the database it a contracts out to another which may in turn subcontract work a party might be an a or a all subclasses of from my you would have a party table and then more specific tables for each which could then be further subclassed person has your experience led you to feel about did you use and would you do so what the pros and has its benefits if you need flexibly to add new types to your system and create relationships between types that you expect at the beginning and architect in moving to a new companies hiring other it also gives you the benefit of running a single query and retrieving data for multiple types of parties on the flip adding additional layers of abstraction to get to the data you actually need and are increasing load at least the number of on the database when querying for a specific if your abstraction goes too likely need to run multiple queries to retrieve the data as the complexity would start to become detrimental to readability and database the party model limit your choice of for did have to eliminate certain orms they allow for enough of between domain objects and your physical is an area that admittedly a bit weak but found that using views and mirrored abstraction in the application layer made this too much of a the real problem for me has always been a is piece of data x when i want to read the data source directly not always intuitive for new developers on the system

are three types of standards behaviour you should be interested this will work on all complying use this as it depends on the implementation but at least still implementations are required to document what they do in these use this if you care about anything can and we mean up to and including your entire computer collapsing into a naked singularity and swallowing you and a large proportion of your never use make me come over more that 4 characters and a to a is undefined it matter why your program crashes with 14 characters but not almost certainly overwriting some information on the stack and your program will most likely produce incorrect results in the crash is better since at least it stops you relying on the possibly bad the size of the array to something more suitable in this case with the available or use some other data structure that can you seem so concerned with finding out why an extra 7 characters cause problems but 8 characters envisage the possible stack layout on entering i say since the actual layout depends on the calling convention that your compiler since the c code calls with and the stack at the start of after allocating space for a could look like c code return address argc argv x you write the bytes it overwrites the and on return from specifically populates populates and populates provided you actually try to after be if you write the extra to it overwrites the and one byte of the return address so when attempts to return to the c it goes off into fairy land this depends entirely on the calling convention of your possible a different compiler would always pad out arrays to a multiple of 4 bytes and the code fail there until you wrote another three even the same compiler may allocate variables on the stack frame differently to ensure alignment is what they mean by you going to

are two ways for specifying parameters in one is using an identifier and the other is using a parameter type the identifier list can be but the type list can to say that one function takes no arguments in a function definition you do this with an identifier do something this with a parameter type do something in a parameter type list the only one parameter type is void must have no name then that means the function takes no but those two ways of defining a function have a difference regarding what they first defines that the function takes a specific number of but neither the count is communicated nor the types of what is needed as with all function declarations that use identifier so the caller has to know the types and the count precisely so if the caller calls the function giving it some the behavior is the stack could become corrupted for because the called function expects a different layout when it gains identifier lists in function parameters is it was used in old days and is still present in lots of production they can cause severe danger because of those argument promotions the promoted argument type do not match the parameter type of the function behavior is undefined and are much less of so always use the thingy for functions without in both and definitions of type second one defines that the function takes zero arguments and also communicates that like with all cases where the function is declared using a parameter type which is called a if the caller calls the function and gives it some that is an error and the compiler spits out an appropriate second way of declaring a function has plenty of one of course is that amount and types of parameters are another difference is that because the compiler knows the parameter it can apply implicit conversions of the arguments to the type of the if no parameter type list is that be and arguments are converted to promoted types is called the default argument will become for while will become type for the if a file contains both an omitted identifier list and a parameter type the parameter type list the type of the function at the end contains a f has now a is because both declarations do not say anything the had something to say in which is that one argument is the same can be done in int first defines a function using an identifier while the second then provides a prototype for using a declaration containing a parameter type

are various different approaches here the under two main each typically with their own benefits and in terms of effectiveness and it is probably best to choose the simplest algorithm for whatever application and only use the more complex variants if necessary for whatever that these examples use since that will deal with null elements you could do better than zero for null if if t is constrained to struct it is also you can hoist the lookup out of the function if so you use operations on the hashcodes of the individual entries which are then this will lead to the same end result regardless of are several obvious options on static int int hash foreach element in hash hash return downside of that is that the hash for is the same as the hash for if not a problem for your situation probably the simplest static int int hash foreach element in hash unchecked return is fine hence the explicit are still some nasty cases and but more likely to be particularly with in the case of lists that may contain such you could always implement a custom hashing function one that takes the index of recurrence of the specific value as a parameter and returns a unique hash code is an example of such an algorithm that gets around the aforementioned problem in a fairly efficient it also has the benefit of greatly increasing the distribution of the hash codes generated the article linked at the end for some a analysis of exactly how this algorithm produces hash codes would be quite but testing it across a large range of input values and plotting the results should verify it well static int int hash int int bitoffset stores number of occurences so far of each var valuecounts new foreach element in curhash if out bitoffset the current hash code is shifted one further left on each successive recurrence of a value to widen the 37 is an arbitrary low prime number that helps algorithm to smooth out the hash return has few if benefits over small numbers and a mix of positive and negative numbers they may lead to a better distribution of hash as a negative to offset this becomes a useless entry contributing nothing and any zero element results in a can zero not to cause this major static int int hash foreach element in int h if hash unchecked return other core approach is to enforce some ordering then use any hash combination function you the ordering itself is immaterial so long as it is static int int hash foreach element in f is any you like returning hash return has some significant benefits in that the combining operations possible in can have significantly better hashing properties of bits for but this comes at significantly higher the sort is log and the required copy of the collection is a memory allocation you avoid given the desire to avoid modifying the implementations should normally avoid allocations one possible implementation of would be similar to that given in the last example under the addition section any constant number of bit shifts left followed by a multiplication by a prime you could even use successive primes on each iteration at no extra since they only need be generated if you were dealing with cases where you could calculate and cache the hash and amortize the cost over many calls to this approach may yield superior also the latter approach is even more flexible since it can avoid the need to use the on the elements if it knows their type and instead use per byte operations on them to yield even better hash such an approach would likely be of use only in cases where the performance was identified as being a significant if you want a reasonably comprehensive and fairly overview of the subject of hash codes and their effectiveness in blog would be worthwhile in particular the a simple hashing algorithm

as probably is that got one form inside another form ie the legacy form is appearing inside the form required by the master quick rather way to get around this is to close the form above the legacy and then open a new form below the legacy this means got three forms on the none of which are you end up with something like closing tag at the start closes the from the master you then have your which should now work as then the open tag at the end simply ensures that the closing tag from the master page is valid anything appearing on the master page after the legacy form be within the standard so this may not work for you depending on how the rest of your page is not a particularly elegant but it works as a quick fix on what else is on your master used it where we had one legacy form required on a site with hundreds of so we simply wanted a fix rather than anything that affected the master page our we change the legacy form as this was supplied by a regularly and needed to be dropped into the page without a developer getting involved to amend it as opposed to solution to his own question which requires editing the form and is clearly a better option in his case and probably in most other cases where there is a similar

asked for an so here is one i have prefix on the interface but use a or prefix on the corresponding concrete most of your code will generally reference the so why pollute it with the prefix and not the generally much less used concrete approach does introduce one inconsistency in that some concrete types will be prefixed ones with matching and others will this may be useful since it reminds developers that an interface exists and its use should be preferred over the concrete be use the prefix on the but i think it is more because i have become so accustomed and comfortable with to

assignment the lvalue on the right hand side is not needed in some newer languages like the following in there is no need to practice is very common in programs to avoid accidental assignments that were meant to be return multiple return points was enforced mainly because you want to forget to delete your if you just use raii you need to worry about there are still good reasons to minimize multiple return and sometimes it is useful to have only most modern you do not separate your code into declaration and defines for multiple header file you used to often sometimes would lead to something like the following better way to do this if your compiler supports variable c you had to declare all variables at the top of your block of even later versions of c require this but people still do contains some unique notation can still be but i mean that kind of hungarian it was very important in c to have things ix you could have completely type unsafe functions if i would have called the string my program would have course the fix to this is to use only typesafe so as long as you do that you need hungarian notation in this still it is a good idea as discussed by joel in his

basic idea is to write the wcf code for your clients in just easier this and use a bridge dll to bridge the gap between your unmanaged code and the managed wcf code written in is the process using visual studio 2008 along with first thing to do is create the wcf service and a means to host if you already have skip to step 7 create a windows nt service following the steps from use the default names offered by vs2008 for the project and any classes that are added to the this windows nt service will host the wcf a wcf service named helloservice to the to do the project in the solution explorer window and select the menu in the add new item select the wcf service template and click the add this adds the helloservice to the project in the form of an interface file a class file and a default service configuration file the helloservice like public interface string public class helloservice public string return the service1 class created in step 1 above to look like partial class service1 private servicehost public protected override void string args new helloservice protected override void try if catch the the visual studio 2008 command navigate to the output directory for the type the this installs the windows nt service on your local open the services control panel and start the service1 it is important to do this in order for step 9 below to another instance of visual studio 2008 and create an mfc which is about as far away as you can get from as an i simply created a dialog mfc application and added a say button to the project in the solution explorer and select the properties menu under the general change the output directory to under the general add to the additional include under the linker general add to the additional library click the ok the file select the menu select the class library change the name to helloserviceclient and click the ok the project in the solution explorer and select the properties menu in the build change the output path to so the assembly and file will be in the same directory as the mfc this library will contain the service the wcf proxy to the wcf hello service hosted in the windows nt the solution the references folder for the helloserviceclient project and select the add service menu in the address type the address of hello this should be equal to the base address in the file created in step 2 click the go the hello service should show up in the services click the ok button to automatically generate for the hello seem to always run into compilation problems with the file generated by this i know if doing it wrong or if there is a but the easiest way to fix this is modify the file the problem is usually a namespacing issue and can be fixed with minimal just be aware that this is a for this changed the to simply helloservice with any other required allow the mfc application to interact with the wcf we need to build a managed from the file select the menu select the win32 project change the name to helloserviceclientbridge and click the ok for the application change the application type to dll and check the empty project click the finish first thing to do is modify the project the project in the solution explorer and select the properties menu under the general change the output directory to and change the common language runtime support option to common language runtime support under the references add a reference to the and mscorlib click the ok the following files to the helloserviceclientbridge project and the to look like dllapi dllapi comment if link dllapi static const the to look like dllapi helloserviceclientbridge syntax for the file uses managed which takes some getting used modify the to look like namespace namespace namespace namespace const binding gcnew address gcnew client gcnew try call to wcf hello message marshal from managed string back to unmanaged intptr ptr rv catch return only thing left to do is update the mfc application to invoke the on the mfc the say button to generate the buttonclicked event make the event handler look like try message name catch the application and click the say this will cause the application the method of the wcf hello service hosted in the windows nt service should still be by the the return value is then displayed in a message you can extrapolate from this simple example to fit your if this does not please let me know so i can fix the

basic rules are actually fairly where it gets tricky is in how they apply to your cache works on two temporal locality and spatial former is the idea that if you recently used a certain chunk of probably need it again the latter means that if you recently used the data at address probably soon need address cache tries to accomodate this by remembering the most recently used chunks of it operates with cache typically sized 128 byte or so even if you only need a single the entire cache line that contains it gets pulled into the so if you need the following byte already be in the this means that always want your own code to exploit these two forms of locality as much as jump all over do as much work as you can on one small and then move on to the and do as much work there as you simple example is the 2d array traversal that answer if you traverse it a row at a reading the memory if you do it read one then jump to a completely different location start of the next read one and jump and when you finally get back to the first it will no longer be in the same applies to jumps or branches mean less efficient cache usage not reading the instructions but jumping to a different of small probably change anything only skipping a few so still end up inside the cached but function calls typically imply that jumping to a completely different address that may not be unless it was called cache usage is usually far less of an issue what you usually need to worry about is the data a struct or all members are laid out which is in an all entries are laid out contiguously as in linked each node is allocated at a completely different which is pointers in general tend to point to unrelated which will probably result in a cache miss if you dereference if you want to exploit multiple it can get really as only one cpu may have any given address in its l1 cache at a so if both cores constantly access the same it will result in constant cache as fighting over the

basicly seen 2 types of async you give a call a callback which should be performed after the in such way works gio of previously mentioned it is relativly easy to program with it but you usually have the thread in which the callback will be run changed if it is intergrated with main loop as in case of you check if the data is in such manner bsd sockets it has an advantage of not necessary being integrated with main loop and running callback in specific you program for gnome or like to add that seems to be a very nice i used will have better support for async

be careful that the program is in the not just the perl binaries and core programs usually end up in but others may end up in the site specific directory the command aid your make sure your reflects your are two common at least that i know to run a perl program from the windows command first is to create a batch version of the program with which will execute with the installed programs usually do this automatically because and take care of second is to create a file this is done by creating the registry key if for the current user and set the value you can call programs just by naming them with the now you can invoke the program with may have noticed that you can call a program on windows without the the program is searched for in the but when no is used to complete the append to the and you can invoke the program just with note that the order in this list is important for the just as the order in usually take care of the last two but this knowledge is useful if like to add your own or need to fix

been reading up on linq lately to start implementing and a particular thing as to how it generates update queries that bothers the entities code automatically using sqlmetal or the object relational apparently all fields for all tables will get attribute which means that for every update and delete get sql statement like table set a where and and ad call me a but this seems extremely inefficient to and it feels like a bad idea even if it i know the fetch will be done by the clustered primary so not but sql still needs to check every field after that to make sure it in some very sensitive applications something like this can be but for the typical web app stack it seems like would be a more appropriate and personally prefer since linq will only update the actual fields that not all and in most real the second person editing something wins does mean that if two people manage to edit the same field of the same row in the small time between reading that row and firing the then the conflict that would be found be but in reality a very rare the one thing we may want to guard against when two people change the same thing be caught by because they click submit at the exact same time so there will be no conflict at the time the second datacontext reads and updates the record the datacontext is left open and stored in session when the page is or some other seriously bad idea like as rare as the case really like to not be getting exceptions in my code every now and then if this my first question am i wrong in believing for web not for banking i missing some reason why having as default is a sane second question can i change this is there a way to tell sqlmetal or the ord which updatecheck attribute to trying to avoid the situation where i have to remember to run a tool have to make take some regexes and edit all the attributes in the file because evident that at some point run sqlmetal after an update to the we run this and all our code will break in very subtle ways that we probably find while testing in stories are more than love to learn from other experiences on you very conflict setting updatecheck

been thinking of answering this for a but figured someone else might come up with a better because mine is rather not aware of any such unit testing think your best bet is to try and refactor your c module such that dependencies on the httpd code base are contained in a very thin glue i worry too much about dependencies on that can easily be linked into your unit test things like using the request record that you should try to abstract out a little go as far and suggest that such a refactoring is a good idea if the code is suspected to contain security flaws and bad just usually a pretty big you might also consider is running integration tests rather than unit tests come up with a set of requests and expected responses from the and run a program to compare the actual to expected not the response been looking and you probably thought of something along this line but at least i can tell you from experience that if the module be replaced with something new for business then refactoring it for testability will likely pay off in the longer

best bet is to move to a set based operation in the not going write this for you but let me get you and we can see where we go from keep in mind i am writting this without tables schemas and so not going expect look at your update statements from what i can tell you are updating the same table with the same where clause the only difference is the you can consolidate this to look cachedstats basically we are going to set the counts based on the type inline in the update case when 1 or 4 or then leads 1 else leads when then else clicks when then else views publisherearning advertisercost cachedstats join inserted on and and do aggree with you that this could get ugly but a decision have to for your insert i would handle that the same way you already are just insert into the table from the inserted table whatever already

best explanation is by try for all cars advertised on the web with engines smaller than litres that run and have an mp3 connection and can been seen in a showroom conveniently accessible by public transport from my just be able to help you with that not you have to make several searches and correlate the results on the semantic be able to express an interest in products for sale that are and add the every result would be one or more uis might enable you to do some may be others entirely other creating a chart of things not normally stored in one say the popularity of diet or country walks in a population versus the levels of clinical obesity in the same for these you may not use a web browser at but might use more like but the semantic web gives you tools for finding and manipulating the data that is out there and is accessible via the point made by bravax is not entirely not a lot may change you may merely get some more useful and better mashup web or you may find yourself doing a whole lot of stuff you never thought of as being related to the web before current web has lots of alternatives for doing the same say animated dhtml for putting data on the semantic web there will be a range of tools and rdfa is a good a more general type of but you could a of the whole expose a use a microformat or a proprietary html structure and a there will be many tools to suit different vartec is also partially you may use rdfa and erdf but you could also use a whole lot of other things for publishing that there is a lot over overlap between the semantic web and another simper concept called how they relate to each other but my perception of it is that the linked data web is what you need before semantic web tools and techniques have anything to linked data is about the semantic web is more about processing the reasoning over it and handling issues like trust reliability and such essentially the bottom few layers of technology

best way for you to learn c is to put in practice the topics you are example if you are going through basic principles like looping and if you can build yourself a little program that simulates the functionality of counting changes on a vending you move on to more advanced topics like pointers and data structures you can build a logo like the user can input each step of the and you can store that in a linked afterwards you can perform pointer operations on your data structure by or adding the idea is to start coding to test what you you will find that some of the time you really understand even though it seemed clear in the as a good programmer you will end up having to revisit the topics until you actually know

best way to achieve this will be to write a window service that acts like a mail client or this windows service should execute a timed action triggered by a which connects to the mail server and polls the server for any unread available in the email the email id to check for is the email id on which the users will give their input if the windows service client finds that there exists any new then it should download and filter the email body and push further for processing based on the user input in the you can host the input processing in the same windows service but it is not advisable to do the windows service can put the inputs in a special application directory or database from where your main appication can read the user inputs received in email and process them as will be required to develop a high performance client for doing i advise you not to use the default library due to performance instead use one of the best availabel open source implementations for like from we have used this in our applications and achieved remarkably grear this	
	
best way to do this will be to encrypt the sections during installation add an installer class to your project and override the install method in the in this method you should perform the you must call at the end of your overridden install in the setup project goto custom actions and locate the install custom action to be pointed with your project output or which contains the definition of your installer class this way it will encrypt your sections during an installation straight and you will not face this the application will automatically use dpapi provider to through sections or this

better idea is to replace those with the use of any logging like and of as paul show the user meaningful error messages where ever	
	
better or the answer is when the framework came out and tableadapters were included in the it became ridiculously easy to get your basic crud type or even a front page showing simply connect to your drag your and the structure was in including key need to perform updates on this use the specify your existing or let the wizard generate the procedures for hook that up to a gridview and you can quickly do lots of edit multiple records while and update in single or this kind of convenience is hard to pass up when working on projects that want to get done plus having things in this native format become convenient for xml shenanigans if that is what you need since the dataset model uses xml under the hood for a lot of will admit that i have not checked out the latest versions of the orms out and not sure if there is a wizard for linq that will do this much within a few and most people are a little slow to adapt newer technology as so it easy to see how it is still being used that new dynamic data service is built off of linq to sql or linq to i think the tide might finally change to the newer	
	
better solution would be to use one or more object to store your points geometry can be drawn with a so you could indeed change the stroke thickness when you but more flexible is to use the transform the you can the actual coordinates of the geometric representation and not the visualization so when you draw you need to fiddle with render compute the i use the following code static matrix rect bool matrix translatethenscale first translate to origin since just we scale the graph to the appropriate we flip the graph vertically around the viewport middle since in our graph positive is not if we push the graph to the right which will usually simply be return the fromposition rect should contain the untransformed and the toposition rect should contain the transformed this also trivially allows for scaling x and y which is often necessary for easy to compute the bounds of your bounds are modified by the so we want no graphbounds set the transform if the transform is the following graphboundsalt of course wpf can tell you which bounds you need to render should that be putting it you could do something void bool rect graphbounds matrix transmat new advantage of using this solution is that you need to mess with free to use transforms that shear scale x and y independently without getting weird distortions in your and you can treat the pen as an opaque object easier to customize from the ui if you select pen width or no further correction is

biggest difference is that selenium has support for different browsers just ie or see selenium has a remote control server which means that you need to run the browser on the same machine the test code is you can therefore test your web on different os general i would recommend using used watin few years but i satisfied with its stability has probably improved by the biggest plus for selenium for me is the fact that you can test the web on different

bindings with the are a bit complicated because there are two things it a binding for the and a binding for which one of those values is what makes it even more complicated is that there are a couple of perfectly legitimate ways of doing and which one you choose entirely depends on your structure to some personal in order to get a list of you bind the in your probably bind this to the key of an in this each menu item represents one by the title of the menu item is the string returned by calling on each item in the if you want to use a different property for the menu you can also bind the just make sure the key path you specify for has the key path for as its prefix you might use for and for will give you menu items that represent what you need next is some way of identifying the selected there are three different bindings you can and they the index of the array object that the user the object value of the objects in the and the string title of the selected item of the objects in the array if you bound that in your you might bind to a property on your controller when the user clicks the you only have to refer to the

blog post great programming industry sort of answers short the first microcomputers run and the number of programmers was growing faster than the new ones could be educated by the old the programming culture basically started over in the early 1980s on and then the microcomputer programmers had to spend the next 30 years going through the growing pains that the programmers had already gone post rescued from wayback machine and posted great programming industry january while back i bought a copy of structured programming available as a free pdf from the primarily so that i could read essay on structured expanded version of in addition to on structured it contains an essay by hoare on and one by hoare and dahl on program was this last program which ended up having the greatest impact on it describes a programming language called simula simula 67 is an extended version of algol which contains some extra simulation it has these things called which each describe the behavior of a bunch of individual it has this thing which allows one class to include all of the attributes and behaviors of another also this function and statically typed and garbage similarity to java was so striking that i was depressed for i started looking a little bit forward and backwards from java and simula and i found some interesting similarities between a progression of languages that happened since the microcomputer revolution and a progression that happened before the microcomputer trying to interpret history a good portion of which i did not live so i realize that i am entering dangerous i encourage those of you who lived through this history to confirm deny any parts of my speculation that you am more familiar with the more recent so start 4k basic for the altair you can try out on peter simh based altair began a period of popularity for followed by one for pascal and and ignoring garbage collection in the rough order in which features were added level control structures while with and and recursive noticed that i can construct a very similar progression going from fortran to algol 60 to simula with the exception that the object oriented features come more or less at the same time as garbage i realize that i am picking and choosing my comparison points making me vulnerable to the texas sharpshooter also using a progression of popular languages for the languages and a progression languages that each sort of inspired the next for the but i have often felt like history is repeating and this particular pair of sequences worked as a lense to focus my have a hypothesis that many parts of the programming industry essentially rebooted with the microcomputer and two possible reasons that may have contributed to this reason alan kay has argued that when people join a community faster than they can be a new pop culture develops where things which used to be common knowledge among the community become relatively little is it possible that the microcomputer revolution caused the number of programmers to grow so quickly that the overall more ignorant programmer communities of the early 1980s needed to repeat the evolution that their predecessors from the mainframe and minicomputer eras went reason the early microcomputers just have the horsepower to run the more sophisticated programming systems that had been developed on mainframes and trying to run a smalltalk or lisp system in or or 64k on a 1mhz processor just particularly by the mid 1980s the microcomputers were powerful enough to do some of the fancier but by maybe the new programmers had spent enough time in their impoverished environments that they were only able to be drug into higher level programming languages a little bit at a my speculations are then it is kind of depressing that we have lost so many but it is also kind of encouraging that we are making because it would mean that we stuck in an endless cycle of technology reinventing the same thing over and but instead we are almost caught up to where we were before our industry did a great and we are getting closer to stepping into genuinely new i were to continue the two progressions of languages that i made i would continue the older one into and the newer one into with the new features being something like and was actually inspired by simula i and not simula but alan team paid a lot of attention to simula 67 in the i read somewhere i find the link that simula begin was required reading in the learning research group at xerox by glomek at denatale collection is nearly as old as the use of mathematical formulas in programming lisp is of the same vintage as fortran and cobol initial conception of programming purposely left out inheritance as he like the way dahl and nygaard had done it in just wrote about concept of

both cases you ask the processor to move the value from a specified one level of in the first case you ask it to take the address from a specified in the second case you specify an offset processors support dual level so not possible to request to load a value from an address specified somewhere in memory you have to load the address onto a a number of assemblers and built into assembler for you could as well write dword ptr it would mean the could dword ptr would instruct to take the address of then add value of ebx and use the sum as an address from which to load a this is often used for accessing array elements by all these cases the processor would do the same load a value from a specified one level of indirection each

brain blew up because it got into an infinite a common beginner it or you already understand just being dragged down by a but faulty metaphor for a a small box with stuff that comes in and instead of a task or such as out more about recursion on the recursive and you have no problem with to complete this task you read a result page for once read follow the first link on it that new page about recursion read follow the first link on it that new page about recursion read follow the first link on it you can been doing recursive stuff for a long time without any how long would you keep doing that forever until your brain blows of course you will stop at a given whenever you believe you have completed the no need to specify this when asking you to out more about recursion on the because you are a human and you can infer that by infer so you must include an explicit out more about recursion on the you understand it or you have read a maximum of 10 also inferred that you should start at result page for and again something a computer the complete description of our recursive task must also include an explicit starting out more about recursion on the you understand it or you have read a maximum of 10 and at grok the whole i suggest you try any of these a gentle introduction to symbolic this is the cutest explanation of little

by writing tests for lower level parts of the spam filter you need to have in your mind a rough design of how the algorithm should then you isolate a core part of the algorithm and write tests for in the case of a spam filter that would maybe be calculating some simple probability using theorem know about bayesian so i could be you build it step by until finally you have all the parts of the algorithm implemented and putting them together is requires lots of practice to know which tests to write in which so that you can do tdd in small enough if you need to write much more than 10 lines of code to pass one new you probably are doing something start from something smaller or mock some of the safer err on the smaller so that the steps are too small and your progress is than trying to make too big steps and failing generic example that you have might be better suited for an it will probably even run very because you first need to initialize the spam filter with example so it be useful as a tdd tdd tests need to be as in many hundreds or thousands tests per

can actually reproduce the behaviour of const in you just have to do it the only way the caller can modify its state is by calling methods on it or setting is of type public void public string get set in your happy for them to get the but not set and definitely not happy about them calling that define an interface describing what allowed to public string get left out the mutating method and only left in the getter on the add that interface to the base list of in your class with the you have a fooclass a property ifooconst get return basically reproduces by hand precisely what the keyword would do in a reference of type foo is like an automatically generated type that only includes those members of that were marked as translating this into some theoretical future version of declare like public void public string get const set all done is merged the information in back into by tagging the one safe member with a new so in a adding a const keyword add much to the language besides a formal approach to this if you had a reference to a fooclass f would only be able to call the const members on that if the definition is the caller could cast an into a but they can do that in too called away and involves a special operator called t also the issue of interfaces not being very easy to evolve between versions of your if a third party may implement an interface you define they are free to do if they can see then you add new methods to it in future versions without requiring others to recompile their but only a problem if you are writing an extensible library for others to build maybe a feature would solve this

can store values smaller than 8 or 32 you just need to pack them into a struct and use unsigned int a can be 0 through bool b the stores 0 or unsigned int c can be 0 through unsigned int d can be 0 through most your compiler will round up the total size of your structure to 32 bits on a 32 bit the other problem like you pointed that your values may not have a power of two this will make for wasted if you read the entire struct as one you will find values that will be impossible to if your input ranges all powers of feature you may find interesting is a they work like a but share so if you write to one field it overwrites the if you are really tight for and you want to push each bit to the there is a simple encoding say you want to store 3 each can be from 0 to bit fields are because if you use 3 bits waste some values you could never set 6 or even though you have room to store lets do an are three example each can be from 0 to int one two three pack them together most we should think in base 6 each value is from so packed into the smallest possible space packs all the values into one from 0 could be any value from 0 there are no pack one 6 how it looks like encoding in base each number is multiplied by place like where n is the place at to int one pack int two pack int three schemes are extremely handy when you have to encode some fields in a bar code or in an alpha numeric sequence for human just saying those few partial bits can make a the fields all have to have the same if one field is from 0 through use 8 instead of 6 in the proper there is no requirement that all fields have the same

cdata section is for the purpose of allowing literal text that would normally be interpreted in a special way in an xml that something that looks like an entity or something that looks like xml anything in a cdata section can be inside valid xml without a cdata just need to use entity references to encode the various special characters so they be treated as xml but as character data that is the value of a the following is perfectly as long as it is what you the value of the element is the value which will not be interpreted by the xml parser as the entity reference for the copyright you can also do the this looks xml the value for the element this looks xml do this without a cdata this looks xml is much less but equivalent as far as an xml parser is if you did this that the element is defined an a schema or dtd as containing a string and not then your xml parser will this looks xml you use the cdata or entity escaping to protect the special characters from the xml parser so the client of the xml data can get the value of which happens to contain xml markup to be the above example is but if the schema or dtd says that the element contains or then it is an xml html or xhtml entities that are not defined as part of xml itself are not valid xml unless they are your xml parser will return an

certainly tempting to begin by learning one of the popular i would advise against it as a first they are the easiest ones to find help but they are also the languages with the most idiosyncratic limitations and twists due to the way things evolved with industrial a lot of confusing and difficult to have a critic eye without the perspective of the more exotic languages are often cleaner and simpler to especially if you have ideas about the communities are but that also means they are more fun and i think better to learn the bases first with a very language and an interactive you could go through to design an excellent book which goes from simple math to advanced have a look at with or is probably not a bad idea to experiment with when you want to go to more popular there is and the web languages like html and c will be nice when you wonder how things really work with the reserve java and for when you need a they are not that fun anyways

comment above suggested i summarize the answer i found it says to provide your own handler for this is the recommended let the inherited message handler respond first at this you can either prevent windows from just call the same cleanup procedure that you call in var am not sure that calling inherited before calling mycleanupprocedure is completely if the inherited procedure responds back to windows windows could still shut down the application before mycleanupprocedure had i am not sure what inherited does for the message i assume it defaults to allowing the shutdown in my the mycleanupprocedure runs very so it would not cause windows to display the dialog due to no response to the be sure my procedure runs to maybe the procedure should look like possibly tell windows it is ok to shut

comments on constructing where clauses in example is by definition going to be because putting single quotes where they and and produce this and and is obviously not going to the single quotes out and it should that never do it that never put the and in the substrings that are used to construct the where because what would i do if i have a value for the second string but not for the you have to concatenate a number of strings with a delimiter and some can be one thing to do is to just concatenate them all and not worry if the string before the concatenation is unassigned of concatenate 0 strwhere strwhere and 0 strwhere strwhere and 0 strwhere strwhere and all three strings are that would give and 5 and 123 and use to chop of the first 5 characters and it will always come out regardless of which of the variables have values none of them are get a which is what you if any one of them is first get and which is an erroneous leading which you just chop out with the this works because you know that all the results before the will start with and no matter what no needless tests for whether or not strwhere already has been assigned a value just stick the and in there and chop it off at the another someone mentioned sql in regards to there was a lengthy discussion of that which considers a lot of issues close to this sql

common called has been built for the runtime like garbage collection and was previously the barrier to phobos and tango interoperating in the same higher level functionality depended on the phobos runtime and likewise for major update to phobos has been released yesterday as a matter of this update tries to make use of some of the new features of d2 and introduces the concept of which are like iterators but easier to work with and more d2 phobos is very different from its underpowered d1 is by far the better standard library for a d2 port is in and will likely progress much more rapidly when d2 is a big question is whether the tango devs will update it to take full advantage of the d2 or whether they will simply focus on making it work with d2 the same way it does with the two phobos tends to focus more on making simple things syntactic convenience and pushing the envelope of what can be done in a standard something of a cross between stl and standard as weird as that tango tends to have more of a feel to more focused on breadth of features and handling unusual use cases it stays more within the sane subset of d as much template though arguably a major feature of d is to promote template metaprogramming to sane subset and takes a more pragmatic approach to api own guess but it makes a lot of is that phobos will become analogous to a truly standard library of core and tango will become a utility kind of like as more of its core functionality is absorbed into phobos as others d1 is supposed to be so nothing is changing

compiler is optimizing away a variable that is never it cannot optimize a function on the grounds that it will not be as it could be used from a different compilation you could try to force the compiler into considering the variable as used with something akin mark the variable as if it is new return the compiler cannot know if p will be it must better solution would be to explicitly instantiate the template if you want t const value void t const whatever t template implementation another not included from t const value t const v explicit class class 7 linker error not code will only see the header and know what methods but not the real the implementation will be compiled in one compilation where the explicit template instantiation that if you forget to explicitly instantiate one it will be a linker not a compilation one definition one definition rule in states that there can be only one definition for each symbol or having multiple definitions can be detected easily for regular symbols you define two the linker will detect the duplicated but is a little trickier with with templates it is trickier as they are usually declared and defined in header the compiler generates the used symbols in each compilation unit and the linker usually finds more than one equivalent symbol is compiled into each compilation unit that has a and calls compiler flags the templated code as a signifying that while the symbol is defined it can also be defined in another compilation unit and the linker is free to discard the symbol without yielding a link that is a requirement if you want to link different compilation units that make use of the same stl for with the same to gcc gcc linux linker discards all but one of the weak symbols without further some linkers linker in linux will in the near not as know nor it could be alredy do check that the different symbols are in fact the same and provide an to the code is the odr in that you are redeclaring the template in a different you should declare the template once and the implement the methods externally as posted anyway if both definitions are compatible they are in the snippet you all member methods and attributes are exactly the same and with the same qualifiers it should be accepted by the compiler as there is only one definition of the only those methods that are actually called in the code will be void void compiler generates but not

contemplating how to go about this and i think this is one of the key pieces of infrastructure that not having around keeps us in the dark hopefully this will be a popular question on not just that you could install a single tool to collect this because not possible but ideally you want everything from the hardware up to the applications on the network feeding into this think the only approach that makes sense is a modular the range of devices and types of information is too disparate to come under a single also the collection of data needs to be as passive and asynchronous as possible the reality of running infrastructure means that there will be interruptions and you rely on being able to get the data at all think the tools pointed out form something of an ecosystem that could work together cobbler can install from and hand over to which has support for generating nagios and storing configs in a for me only cacti is a bit opaque in terms of programmatically inserting new templates but i know this is you have to sit down and work out which pieces of information are important for the business you work and design a db schema around work out how to get the information you need into the whether from or direct snmp you asked about collection of i think if you have quite disparate kit hp then it makes sense to create a library to abstract away as much as possible the differences between so your scripts just make standard calls such as when you add new hardware you can add to the library rather than having to write a completely new

cookies are very useful for the authentication in the request url is bad there was a news item last week about getting the authentication tokens in the from the google there is no way to prevent older browsers still allow trivial access to cookies via you can bypass http whatever you come up with can be gotten around given enough the trick is to make it too much effort to be you want to make your site more secure is no perfect you could use an authentication cookie that if the cookie is the attacker must use it before it if they then you have a good indication suspicious activity on that the shorter the time window the better for security but the more load it puts on your server generating and maintaining

could also check this ie only behaves a lot like firebug and has a console	
	
could also consider using methods to get the advantage would be that the objecs are not initialized until they are need and also provides a much more loosely coupled code that lets you change the way the database is initialized more public public function if new you use to create a return public function if new return	
	
could also do this with an array of mydata eq	
	
could also issue before or after the query which would provide you with all the meta information you this query is pretty expensive so make sure to cache the if using a model which extends then you should have all this information in this all you need to do is access the protected property

could combine answer about using pickle should use cpickle though for better with is built into python and so all need to do is import then just store the pickled objects as strings in there and have a nice fast method of accessing the data to building your own that will help keep you organized as cpickle is almost identical to pickle in only difference is that it is written in python it may be a good idea to have a user controlled memory usage it would be a shame to be storing a bunch a data on disk and waiting on disk when the user has 8gb of ram	
	
could decouple the user selects file to upload and sends it to your after this he sees a page you for uploading it is now stored in our storage the users has uploaded the file it is stored temporary directory on your server if some metadata is stored in your background process on your server then uploads the file to this would only possible if you have full access to your server so you can create some kind of to to this simply use a page that is displayed polls asynchronously and displays some kind of progress bar to the user s simple this would only be needed if the user should be able to it in a or something like it directly after in case you have only a shared hosting you could possibly build some solution which uses an hidden iframe in the users browser to start a script which then uploads the file to

could either use a regular expression to match the values inside the you use this regular expression to split the bracket list	
	
could encrypt the data using some such as but as was mentioned above it can be reverse engineered by someone using a debugger to see the order to do this securely you would need to have a public key for the and it would use this to get the symmetric key from the which encrypted the key with private then decrypts the symmetric key with the public this symmetric key is used to encrypt the data is small enough then you can use the public key to encrypt but there is size limits based on the size of your public you can do but it can be	
	
could find equations for the edges of both sides and find the middle of those since you now know after that you could fit the points into a new i guess that is similar to the erosion article pointed out by a is the link the posted link was	
	
could give your objects a method that displayed them however you if you want to be you could even have them give their full details the first and subsequently refer back to the full version in later uses your log grow unreadably they have a good name to use as a you could just assign them something or can make the log much easier to read in many and is vital if going to be recursively serializing object structure with have to take special care if the objects can change significantly between reporting always include a summary containing those even in a back

could mark the constructor that takes the argument with the verified that this works and prevents the creation of the spurious temporary object a performance anyone using that constructor could no longer rely on compiler type conversion for you function would change to char new return but i think that is necessarily a bad thing in this case as automatic type conversions can be	
	
could not use given their reliance on mutable exception handling is quite different from jvm and clr you would need to handle this processes as threads would mean that any sizable erlang system runs out of memory pretty fast size on my machine on 1268 thread stack size in 1 and communication between processes is much slower than in you probably want is an actor model implementation on jvm or and clojure have already been in there are many actor implementations for and at least one for which can be used from any	
	
could point out where i can find introductory documentation about the architecture of the python interested in the c but if there are references about other implementations it could be helpful trying to find any kind of resources of higher level than plain source code uml diagrams or something like that would be and information about the design decisions including tradeoffs between the different factors virtual machines architecture	
	
could preprocess the source code files before compilation to add a random amount of random code that actually do it would be simple enough to add innocuous comments in the real source code where you wanted your junk code to be as far as what you do when you are not trying to do my suggestions would be not to loop or wait for too or allocating too much i would err on the side of not caring what the size of the binary output and letting that vary possibly the easiest and most effective way to accomplish that might be to just include some libraries that get and yet get optimized out because they were not if you have your compiler call something quick just so that the lib will get included for your final binaries would differ in size by quite a bit that but the program be appreciably any

could set a to execute on a to clean one of my favourite is to open a and then delete it while you still have it the file stays on the file system and you can read and write but as soon as your program the file goes not sure how do that in one argument give in favour of mktemp instead of using your own if the user anticipates your program is going to create huge temporary he might want set to somewhere like mktemp recognizes your solution i frequently use gvim foo for	
	
could set the read timeout on the sockets to be something short a second maybe or whatever time you want to wait for each with the that when you get the second message from client you can just from client socket and if you get a sockettimeoutexception then you can process you will have to modify your current code to catch any sockettimeoutexceptions you may get whenever reading from the	
	
could show them the results in preview window similar to the way excel does pretty clear when the wrong delimiter is being used in that you could then allow them to select a range of delimiters and have the preview update in real you could just make a simple guess as to the delimiter to start with does a comma or a tab come

couple of ideas that leap to length you could always generate phrases by picking words from a for a good example of this in see length is more use a list of syllables and the result would be a nonsense but pronounceable you might need to filter the results to remove undesirable actual pronounceable is not but you want to be able to quickly verify a code as coming from your then a small crc of a counter packed into a byte array and encoded with or similar would you can improve the human factors by keeping the code and by picking an encoding that eliminates similar letters have and all in the the code needs to be longer than about 5 characters in then consider adopting a standard punctuation scheme that breaks it into is much harder than to read and the number five here is a wild there is probably literature on the best this is really a crypto if there is significant real value to be had from forging these then consult a crypto expert for a best practices answer because rolling your own will cause grief	
	
couple of methods for finding the tables that reference your user table through foreign key relationships have been posted and you get the list of going to have to write the sql to determine which tables have records for a specific no way around since the queries will all look the you could paste the table list into use a formula to build the then paste the queries back into	
	
couple of points i stumbled on while creating a dll had to call a member function of the unmanaged took some time to find out that i can not do this by using dllimport but have to write a the wrapper it is also not enough to wrap just the member i have to be able to create a pointer to the so i have to export the pointer to the constructor how i understand maybe not exactly i tried just exporting the member function it compiled but returned at got stuck there for a while my wrapper looks like this suggested in a class defined in a dll in public class return new bool char return void delete on the class level exports all public members of the returns a pointer to that ccnocrsdk class from the unmanaged dll which member function i have to calls that member note that the pointer to the ccnocrsdk is the code builds into the i have to use the to find out what are the entry points for the wrapper dll i my the results look like 1 0 00001240 class const 2 1 00001220 bool ccnocrsdk 3 2 00001200 class ccnocrsdk 4 3 00001410 void ccnocrsdk finally ready to use my wrapper in the when i did this without specifying the entry point exactly as in my output from i got to find entry entrypoint public static extern intptr entrypoint public static extern bool string out is defined as jaredpar the last step is to enjoy the i have to call the class and then pass the pointer to the actual call to the recodata new string num intptr ptr bool res out res returns and i get the results i expected in	
	
couple of things that may cause do not have the full sdk are missing some registry if you look in the registry of say a windows xp vista machine and search for the sdkinstallroot you will probably find then just replicate the code to your to verify that you have the framework sdks installed least just go to the folder and go to the version you need and search within to try and find say the or if you cannot find them then you do not have the sdk installed but more than likely have the runtime that a go and see if that

course you convert a create statement to a select question therefore why a creation statement is called so it uses if not so it might not even be a design the table would only get created once despite the query is called bazillion maybe your system that uses the database issues this statement from every single as a way to make sure actual database structure matches its just a foolprof in case somebody deletes this super important	
	
covers your question pretty so give you an idiomatic rewrite of your findfactors i found it helpful for me when i was first you want to find all factors of a given number by looking at each number from up to checking to see if a factor of and building a list of those that version minimal modifications to get it to integer integer counter num let quotient div num then else num then findfactors findfactors couple of formatting changes to make it a bit more integer integer counter counter div num 2 otherwise if num counter then else findfactors is but less than ideal in a couple it recalculates quotient each time is which is divisions seems to realize this and calculate it only kinda annoying to have to deal with that counter variable still pretty way of looking at the problem would be to take the list of integers from up to and filter for just those that are factors of this translates pretty directly into integer num filter might come as a surprise to find that this has the same performance characteristics as the above haskell need to allocate memory for the entire list up to at it can just generate each value as

created a crossplatform installation tool after some frustrating experiences with installanywhere and specially its cousin installshield more than half of our clients use our tool to package software but the tool is not that means we have a number of advantages such as native look and feel and no need to do previous to installation less space to mention a to answer your specific calling java code as part of the installation at multiple points in time as when a certain page is files being at uninstall the code is not compiled in the but it can be called externally and the result used in the if you are more specific about which kind of code that you need i can provide specific sample we have a lot of actions for functionality that needs to be manually added to other so you may not need to write that code in the first support all versions of including 64bit and windows 2008 customers have certified on those platforms using our support bundled applications including jboss and take a look at for examples of such stacks that we have support copying and moving substituting values in config unpacking files and most other common installation one of our principles is that the installer should provide support for common installation actions and have an clean interface for invoking external code that is specific to a support bundling as you mention is often enough just to bundle the jre directory and setting the appropriate value for in the launching can take a look at some of our such as installbuilder is a commercial but we offer free licenses for open source projects and discounts for small business and

creating a website my pattern often is the infrastructure talk to domain services or infrastructure and domain services may talk to infrastructure services will wrap things like smtp i handle identity as an infrastructure if an infrastructure service or domain service needs to find out the invoker it will request an identity service at the identity service will have methods properties to identity the this way i have for a that determines the identity by session cookie a little stuck about how to handle results of service for i may have a service that has a method that simply takes a string comment and an identifier for the target application service calls this service perhaps like actionresult string commenttext this method may fail if the current identity or pass policy that the articleservice checks as being able to comment every 30 seconds throwing and catching exceptions from service calls like this seems very because my calling code has no way of checking if it can actually invoke this action successfully fatal app initially i started to make the services return a the result would be uniquely identifiable so the caller would know if the comment was indeed made additionally i would return the comment entity in the the results would also identify things like not post as user is not or not post as specified period has not been actually return strings but you get the reasoning behind this is that the application service be in control of if an action should imagine say i moved all of the user identity checks and everything out of the domain service and into the application have tons of replicated as well as giving the application services completely power over what can guess my question is given that infrastructure services will enforce additionally what is the best way to inform the calling code the action did or and in should secondary data as authorization be handled in an

creating the dictionary to handle the lookups of the various cases in the switch statement instead of making several branching ifs out of it to set the return trust me you want to change how doing it unless you want to make the map i had originally assumed that the dictionary stored a map from each case to the an index into another map for the return according to it actually stores an index to a label for the code that should be executed for that this makes absolute sense when you consider that the code that would be executed for each case may differ and may be much longer than in the given based on your i think i might be tempted to store the mappings in an external configuration read them in during start and construct the actual map either a single level map from key to value or a similar multilevel map from key to index and index to i think it would be easier to maintain these mappings in a configuration file than to update the code every time you needed to add or remove a particular

database table without an index is called a querying a heap results in each row of the table being evaluated even with a the notation for a heap is with n being the number of rows in the adding an index this really depends on the underlying aspects of your database results in a complexity of to find the matching row in the this is because the index most certainly is implemented in a sort of adding rows to the even with an index present is an but for pulling down my will take longer as the number of rows i find the sql select will take longer as the rows grow this is true even after i have added an index for the recipient you are inserting into the middle of an at which point the database engine will need to shift rows down to the same occurs when you delete from the remember there is more than one kind of be sure that the index you are using is not a clustered index as more data must be sifted through and moved with inserts and has given the best option available to do not use an rdbms because your messages are not relational in a formal you will get much better performance from a file has also given correct i do not know why he has been voted down 3 but i will vote him up at the risk that i may lose dbarker is referring to and his suggestion is both acceptable and this rocket surgery suggestion is to not implement this kind of functionality in your if you do remember that delete all place locks on pages in your if you do go forward with putting this functionality into a database then run your selects with a nolock locking hint if it is available on your platform to increase additionally if you have so many concurrent partition your tables vertically as dbarker suggested and place these database files on separate drives just volumes but separate to increase

depends on numerous factors the amount of memory your db the size of the rows in the use of a parameterised query and so but generally 10k is not a lot of rows and particularly if the table is well indexed then not going to cause any modern rdbms any sweat at a rule of thumb i would generally only start paying close attention to performance issues on a table when it passes the 100k rows and 500k usually cause much of a problem if indexed correctly and accessed by performance usually tends to fall off catastrophically on large tables you may be fine on 500k rows but crawling on 600k but you have a long way to go before you are at all likely to hit such	
	
depends on the character encoding you are in character or a single byte inside a character can never be mistaken for another then as long as the string you are searching in and the string you are using to search are in the same encoding then you can continue to use the regular string search you are using a encoding other than which does not prevent single bytes within a character from appearing like other then it is never safe to do a string search using the regular string search you may find false this is because string comparison in functions such as strpos is and with the exception of which is specifically designed to prevent this encodings suffer the problem that any subsequent byte in a character made up of more than one byte may match part of a different the string you are searching and the string you are searching for are of different character then conversion will always be otherwise find that for any string that would be represented differently in the other it will always return you should do such conversion on decide on a character encoding your app will and be consistent within the any time you receive input in a different convert on the way

developing a php mysql application that handles multiple simultaneous thinking of the best approach to take when it comes to locking warning against records that are currently being viewed scenario to avoid is two users viewing the one making a then the other doing likewise with the potential that one change might overwrite the the latest versions of wordpress they use some method to detect but it does not seem wholly reliable often returning false at least in my assume some form of ajax must be in place to the application and let it know the record is still being viewed edited a user might simply close their browser and then how would the application know solution i could see is to check the last updated time when a record is submitted for to see if in the interim it has been updated elsewhere and then offer the user a choice to proceed or discard their own barking up the wrong tree in terms of a solution what are peoples experiences of implementing this must be a fairly application record locking best

difference is that if you get that result into a reference yourself you can track the changes of the integer member variable in your own variable name without recalling the x might have probably not the best design and very dangerous to return a reference or in case a variable that gets freed from scope is so if you return a be careful to be sure it is not a variable that goes out of is a slight difference for the modifier but again probably not something that is worth doing or that was int 1 or something else another thread could have changed int x return the end result is that you obtain changes even after the parameters are

disagree with the by bug concept even the tester is inside or of directly counting the number of you can use some rating mechanism concerning the severity i mean to measure the carelessness of the a programmer is writing a code without handling the this problem is bigger than a error in complex logic in a complex so using a rating mechanism for each bug would be better for such a in that case each will get a fair weight and we can get a overall idea about the performance using the sum of the error the other hand this approach also can make problems because the rating is also done by human but having a team for make this rating will reduce such problems and the mechanism will get more usable with the time with necessary improvements and its your duty to sub group the bug categories and assign them the necessary i think you cannot do this at this also should get matured over time with

do not really agree to types in allow variable in question to actually dbnull is a way to say another this value considered to be since we a way do differentiate actually null or in native to our current runtime null in another system we nullable types and dbnull completely different distinction is only required if you do not know if your local variable has allready been fetched from the if you know that the variable has been fetched from the database it would be okay to identify null and the difference is that null in programming languages signals the absence of a value and null null is in databases the null indicates something more like an unknown therefore null null is false in null equals nothing at all because you cannot tell for an unknown value if it equals another unknown i am not sure if dbnull is implemented this way and evaluates to just tested it and dbnull does not behave as evaluates to true but should yield false with the semantic of the database	
	
do not think you can do treeview and the hierarchicaldatatemplate expect a hierarchy of the dataset is inherently will have to somehow convert that dataset to a hierarchy of each with its own the itemssource of the treeview will be bound to the level rows without a parent hierarchicaldatatemplate will have its itemssource property bound to the corresponding children might be a solution using but if it exists it would probably end up being more complicated than straight up reshaping the data before

fact that you can break the chain at any point differentiates the chain of responsibility pattern from the decorator decorators can be thought of as executing all at once without any interaction with the other links in a chain can be thought of as executing one at a because they each depend on the previous the chain of responsibility pattern when you can conceptualize your program as a chain made up of where each link can either handle a request or pass it up the i used to work with the win32 i would sometimes need to use the hooking functionality it hooking a windows message roughly follows the chain of responsibility when you hooked a message such as your callback function would be think of the callback function as the last link in the each link in the chain can decide whether to throw away the message or pass it up the chain to the next the decorator pattern had been used in that you would have been notified of the but you would be powerless to prevent other hooks from handling it as place the chain of command pattern is used is in game you can hook engine and other in the case of a game you want to simply add you want to add functionality and prevent the game engine from performing its default

feel like seen this question asked but neither the so search nor google is helping maybe i just know how to phrase the i need to count the number of events this per day over a given time span so that i can make a graph of website the query i have so far is as as as date usagelog by does most of what i need get a row per date as the output containing the total number of logins and the number of unique users on that the problem is that if no one logs in on a given there will not be a row in the dataset for that i want it to add in rows indicating zero logins for those there are two approaches i can think of for solving and neither strikes me as very a column to the result set that lists the number of days between the start of the period and the date of the current when building my chart keep track of this value and if the next row is not equal to the current row plus insert zeros into the chart for each of the missing a table that has all the dates in the period of interest and outer join against the system working on already has a table for this purpose that contains a row for every date far into the i like and prefer to avoid using especially since that table is intended for another module of the system and would thus introduce a dependency on what developing better solutions or hints at better search terms for for counting events by

feminella is on the right track by iterating once through the i think sorting has a few young says the array be and as pax points out no sort is going to have better performance than iterating over the array interested in why one method is faster than another you might read about o in computer science this is used to describe the growth rate of functions and estimate their running functions will generally be faster than higher order and this is usually written in terms of the number of elements or example the iteration that john proposed is described as and is written as we only go through the array once and it has sorting always requires more over the years a lot of smart people have come up with sorting algorithms that improve but they all have higher growth rates and are higher order than for instance array is and the wikipedia page for has a table with many more may not need it for this but i hope helpful in the future when you do need to do expensive operations like

few although i think any of them will help main thing is that painting off of the awt override and instead call on the this can cause all sorts of problems recreate colors every this may or may not be one of those things that you want to i think though that having a constant for your colors is likely to screw up gcing and will make things easier to keep straight when you want to reuse colors redraw the entire window every you just need to repaint the sections that need to draw the set the background color and let the parent take care of a design the bodies should be in charge of drawing their owner should notify them that they need to be drawn rather than drawing bodies recreate their state every consider having them store it between times and mutate them as you may be spending a lot of time doing trig calculations in the to consider is setting up a timer rather than using a sleep in a while this will get you a more consistent frame but you need to make sure that you can actually meet your obligations coalesce multiple frames into one if you miss a or end up creating too many using a to do the then update the state in the finishing by calling are just a few you should experiment to see what works and what been a while since done java graphics

file replication is we have a web application across 8 different iis due to the nature of the minor changes to files and controls happen frequently throughout the and after being tested and published to are replicated out to each of the public webservers through xcopy deployment on a scheduled basis every 10 course this is incredibly as each server must have a redundant copy of the entire and we would like to eliminate the publishing hosting from shared now have the option to use centralized storage with an iscsi interface to host the entire site with each server believing that the remote storage is a local publishes would be instantaneous and hosting the drive off a unc share is not as there are so many different directories in the site each requiring a filesystemwatcher for to monitor for that the smb maximum command count is quickly we know about the maxcmds and maxmpxct registry changes trigger massive problem we forsee is that certain changes to the file system structure can cause nearly every compiled or to have to causing queued requests and a perception that the server is most resources are not used and so recompiling them on a change causes hardly a blip in a global master page used by all pages on the site can cause but this can easily be managed by primary culprit is the changes to the file cause the entire web application to and recompilations to we currently replicate any changes requires bringing the web server off the load applying the and then warming the server up with junk requests before it is placed back on the load if the like the rest of the web directory is located on centralized there is only one copy of the and individual servers could not be patched and warmed up there a way to get an web application to take its marching orders from a source other than a file named there would be one file per for is the name defined is there a registry setting that could be set on a is there an entry that could be made in the or the global to specify what file to out of so i am i am not asking how to have different appsettings for and there are other topics that cover and all my will be identical most of the the only time i need them to be different is when an update is being using the for any appsettings this is for the really important like assembly httphandler and other settings that can not be tried searching the registry for and found nothing except for applications that noted that i had recently edited which i apparently do a no help in website hosted from shared

foo is not smalltalk a recent addition designed to make it practical to code in prior to that there was no dedicated syntax to declare since they would be created by a command in the interpreting this code as you expected would be wrong for a couple if was a real message sent to then should resolve to which is not possible since it is just being behind the the compiler does something similar where is a symbol for the name of a new class to be it would be possible to write all code like except then you could not use class names directly they exist yet when the code is you would have to do new all over the so the whole form foo is pure syntax that just declares that this class should be and does not mean that at this moment a message should be sent to you want to create classes in the middle of an algorithm and send them messages that would be pretty ugly as a development note that classes have to be registered in the system so that the browser can display that the compiler can automatically recompile that the version control can record what if your code accidentally runs this should you get a second class foo and forget about the previous only the and other tools create new and only at the	
	
for 12 hours is a reality in many wealthier nations i wouldnt put this down to a culture live in a country with one of the highest standards of living in the i create software for the resources within this industry a 12 hour work day is often standard regardless of whether you are a truck driver or a if you are working in a remote area is it common to work 8 up to 12 hour days in a row before having a few days off at is totally counter productive and very unhealthy i wouldnt recommend it to but you can manage to still learn here are my you have a problem that you are unsure how to read stackoverflow etc and really try to get a grip on ways to solve your then try and implement a solution is essential to reinforce your if you leave the implementation till 8 hours later you are likely to have forgotten what you have learnt and just end up wasting you dont have a particularly daunting problem you need to solve try and figure out how to implement at least one part of your code in a more efficient or elegant for if you have a trivial task such as creating some code to consume a web perhaps look at how to load this web service your problem or question and post on stackoverflow just before you leave this way when you arrive back at work you will hopefully have a number of responses to guide you with your which brings me to my next your learning in the morning whilst you are fresh and here are the steps that work for some small part of my code that i think can be improved in some it minutes it immediately to gain the benefits of reinforcement even though you may only learn what seems like a trivial if you do this everyday your knowledge of programming will gradually increase and with it the complexity of the ideas you can tackle within 30 have found 30 minutes is a good window because it is generally small enough to avoid interruptions from phone calls or i find that what i want to achieve involves more than 30 minutes generally i have to push it aside and look at it another time when i am unencumbered by some concepts are difficult and cant be easily digested in your 30 minute lunch not much anyone can do about

found this question very interesting since i had recently done some work on modeling projectile motion with you are essentially updating the position and velocity using an euler where each new value for the states should be a function of the old in such a you should be updating the position then updating the there are more realistic physics models for effect of drag one model by involves a drag force that is proportional to the velocity as which generally applies to low velocity the one i previously suggested involves a drag force that is proportional to the of the velocity as quadratic which generally applies to high velocity address each one with regard to how you would deduce formulas for the maximum velocity and the time required to effectively reach the maximum forego the complete derivations since they are rather equation for updating the velocity would acceleration represents the following differential a the first entry in integral we can find the solution v 0 at t maximum velocity occurs when t so that the second term in the equation is very close to zero the time needed to reach the maximum note that the equation never truly reaches but instead asymptotes towards when the argument of the exponential equals the velocity is around of the maximum probably close enough to consider it you can then approximate the time to maximum velocity can then use these two equations to solve for and given a desired and equation for updating the velocity would acceleration represents the following differential a the first entry in integral we can find the solution v 0 at t maximum velocity occurs when t so that the exponential terms are much greater than 1 and the equation the time needed to reach the maximum note that the equation never truly reaches but instead asymptotes towards when the argument of the exponential equals the velocity is around of the maximum probably close enough to consider it you can then approximate the time to maximum velocity is also equivalent a desired and the second equation for will tell you what should and then you can plug that in to the equation for to get the value for seems like a bit of but these are actually some of the simplest ways to model anyone who wants to see the integration steps can shoot me an email and send them to they are a bit too involved to type i immediately realize but the updating of the velocity is not necessary anymore if you instead use the formulas i derived for if you are simply modeling acceleration from and you are keeping track of the time since the acceleration the code would look something is one of the two formulas for and you would no longer need a velocity in there is a calculating may be more computationally expensive than simply updating velocity with an iterative scheme to the exponential but it is guaranteed to remain stable and under certain conditions trying to get a very short the iteration can become unstable and a common problem with the forward euler maintaining limits on the variables 0 should prevent these if feeling somewhat you may be able to integrate the formula for to get a closed form solution for thus foregoing the need for a newton iteration leave this for others to

gcc on macos x but the the example with works or my adaptation of it it appears you can have as many global typedefs of as you like i had 5 with the version in first typedef inside main is it is a new scope and can define a new meaning for the c99 rationale a typedef could be redeclared in an inner block with a declaration that explicitly contained a type this rule avoided the ambiguity about whether to take the typedef as the type name or a candidate for in implicit int declarations are not so this anbiguity is not possible and the rule is no longer discussing standard it also c89 committee decided to make library headers that they should includable any number of and includable in any this which widespread existing may necessitate some protective wrappers within the headers for redefinitions of to ensure that such protective wrapping can made to and to ensure proper scoping of standard headers may only be included outside of any redefinitions of a in a single scope the file is not allowed in that the multiple external redefinitions of is probably either a feature of gcc or a bug a you change to you get many more	
	
general a graph has a minimum degree and a maximum that is just the minimum respectivly the maximum degree of all nodes in the a graph is that is all nodes have exactly k minimum and maximum degree equal k and the graph is said to be of degree a tree is not you cannot say it has grad but you can find its minimum or maximum common are that are rooted trees where each node has at most k	
	
general going to prefer a single index you providing values for the left most from the point of view of getting the filtering done the more you touch indexed fields in an the more time is going to be spent doing index careful about reading too much into timings of doing sometthing once for small datasets you could easily be looking at connection overhead suggest having a look in the quey plan via query server management studio this will allow you to see which index its actually really so not probing in the	
	
general rule of thumb is that any block is a candidate for a method is done on a not every block should be a this bit of java compiled incase there are any small issues file file open the process the close the would instead do file file file open the process the close the leads to easier to test code you can test the method in isolation without having to provide an array of it also tends to make each method a single conceptual practice my methods are rarely over 20 lines long rarely over 10 i also use the metric to keep the methods simpler thus

general way to prevent nodes in a graph is to mark nodes as you pass and then ignore nodes that are this terribly practical if you want to modify the graph you are scanning so you need a way to mark the nodes the easiest way i can think of to do this under linux would be to store a the for each directory you then when you look at a first check that you already seen any directories with the same this not only handles but also trees that merge back into each get the number take a look at the functions and the and members of the stat storing the probably wanting to look at a or a binary	
	
generally a bad idea to unit test the the very nature of uis make them problematic for automated and are changed much more frequently than other in ways that will break any many automated tests are solvable only by taking image which is obviously very timing concerns become extremely and such automation relies on taking control of the entire including devices such as the keyboard and this means that no other activity can be done on the system while the tests are run for fear of breaking the running much better to move as much of the functionality out of the ui as humanly possible such as help with and test that functionality if you must insist on creating automated tests for the best served to use an automation library designed just for for winforms and is a good example of such a

generation is fine as long as you understands what is being generated or when it has replaced a default value with a custom in this is part of the nhibernate mapping generated by is there a returns whether or not the object has changed its virtual bool ischanged private it will this and what happens when it hand crafted nhibernate entity class will most probably have only column properties and are all scenarios you will run especially in an enterprise world where there are hundreds of programmers working on a project and mediocrity a fact of concern is especially when part of build and one fine day you realize that it should be fine frameworks like allow for partial extension methods etc which help you deal with situations

get into the trap of optimizing without proper as others have suggested use a profiler before making any different data structures that you have enumerated have different a list is very efficient at inserting elements in the beginning and at the end but suffers a lot when accessing random an array has fixed storage but provides fast random finally an arraylist improves the interface to an array by allowing it to normally the data structure to be used should be dictated by how the data stored will be access or memory you seem to be mixing some an array will only give you a continuous chunk of memory for the type of data that you forget that java has a fixed data float and object include all even an array is an it means that if you declare an array of string strings or myobject myobjects you only get a 1000 memory boxes big enough to store the location or of the you get a 1000 memory boxes big enough to fit the size of the forget that your objects are first created with this is when the memory allocation is done and later a reference memory is stored in the the object get copied into the array only

got a webservice which is executed through javascript to retrieve data from the i would like to make sure that only my web pages can execute those web methods i want people to execute those web methods directly they could find out the url by looking at the source code of the javascript for planning to do is add a parameter to all the the key will be stored in the web pages in a hidden field and the value will be set dynamically by the web server when the web page is the key value will only be valid 5 this when a webmethod needs to be javascript will pass the key to the webmethod and the webmethod will check that the key is valid before doing whatever it needs to someone wants to execute the webmethods they have the key which will make them unable to execute your views on is there a better do you forsee any problems with my for what the visitors are not logged in so i use a i understand that if someone really wants to break they can parse the html code and get the value of the hidden field but they would have to do this regularly as the key will change every x which is of course possible but hopefully will be a pain for what doing is a web application opposed to a web the data is retrieved through web methods i would like to prevent anyone from building their own web application using my data they could if they can execute the web obviously it would be a risk for them as i could change the web methods at any will probably just go for the referrer not perfect but easy to i want to spend too much time on this as some of you said if someone really wants to break find a solution anyone from executing your web

guy that did aforge did a fairly good job but not commercial great to learn from but you can tell he was learning too so he has some pretty serious mistakes like assuming the size of an image instead of using the correct bits per not knocking the i respect the heck out of him for learning all that and show us how to do i think a now or at least about to be so really smart just not a commercially usable library has its own weirdness when working with fourier transforms and complex if not it outputs the fourier transform in human viewable format which is nice for humans if you want to look at a picture of the transform but not so good when you are expecting the data to be in a certain format normal i could be mistaken about that but i just remember there was some weirdness so i actually went to the original code they used for the fourier stuff and it worked much also had some other funkyness i like when dealing with the data from the i remember what it was i just know it was much easier to get what i wanted out of the exocortex dsp not a mathematician or engineer to those guys it might make perfect i use the fft code yanked from which is based without anything else and it works i know not but started looking at using fftw and this guy already made a wrapper so i was going to check it out but actually used it i know if you are doing this for school or work but either way there is a great free lecture series given by a stanford professor on itunes

have a message that i am passing to myself which will be subject to because of i am concerned about the integrity of the message being maintained between the time i send and the time that i receive it should be assumed that once i send the message to no information about the message sent will be available to me in the the message is completely that i know that should hash the message contents and compare the hashes before i send the and after i send the if they then the message has been tampered if the knows that the hash is really just the hash of the message then because the message is he can just create new contents and apply the same hash algorithm to the question to what lengths should i go to randomize the message contents when generating the when does it reach the point of diminishing this i have a set of to that the steps that i know i have to take a salt to the the salt is a secret to the rest of the it gets attached to the contents of the message before the pairs in a consistent manner before generating the not a timestamp is going to be added to the contents of each message before to prevent replay are the optional steps that i am the keys before i order considered reversing then ordering by with the separators that separate pairs for the separator for the and the separator for the privacy is a requirement so i am not looking for the values be transmitted in what hashing algorithms should i have an mvc site which i have a controller which handles input validation and on a not important the input is determined to be an automated spam a model of is created with the input values and a viewresult is sent to a general captcha that in the form that contains the captcha the contents of the will be written out in hidden input and the action of the form will be the same action that the contents were originally posted this mvc can pick up the values when the form is because of this i encrypt the pairs maybe i can and tell me why and i need to add one more which contains the hashed message if that value is then the controller will check to see that the message integrity is and allow the input to be persisted if it opted to go with the signedcms class in the which represents the signging and verifying of created a certificate with and then in my i use the example here to digitally sign the it should be a matter of keeping the password on the exported private key as well as security on the which makes it less about have to add an extra key for the timestamp for replay but that be too answer goes to not for his but for his follow up comments which pointed the way to digital and eventually my discovery of how to utilize them in to everyone who message

have already pointed out that this is a result of of quotes and i just wanted to point out that if you look carefully at the structure of the output you you can see how the structure is being built cookie value that getting from is wrapped in quotes the cookie you split on and you have a string that contains you then append a new value to that so that the string contains next time you get that string but with another set of quotes wrapping it but in order to make it so that a web browser will not see two quote characters at the beginning and think all there the inner set of quotes is being so actually returned as then append yet another make another pass back and forth between server and and the next time those backslashes need escaped now you get and so correct as has already been pointed is to let do the parsing instead of chopping up the strings

have been down this road and here are all of the problems you are going to run this looks good for one but what happens when you need 4 other records to create that you end up creating 4 records to test inserting your one this causes all of the following creating and deleting records per test is it will slowly add up and running your tests will take 45 minutes me i was slow tests mean you will never run which means they will be broken most of the time and your delete will fail for some missed foreign key relation or dependency and then trash data will be left in your this trash data will then cause other tests to light of this i would implore you to consider two the first is to try out using an orm instead of writing all this logic then you only need to test your mapping files even less depending on the orm you or look into mocking so you can isolate the logic in your data access code from directly accessing the

have been in a similar i started using fxcop on an existing project some time and had quite a few errors at the what i did was to turn off all the then turn on one group at a resolving errors as i security and performance groups are a good place to start they helped me find issues i was not aware of some of the rules are and may not fully apply to your if at for if internationalization is not an then leave that group turned if there are specific rules that do not apply to such as naming then turn them you manage to clear out a set of errors for a certain you can set the build to fail if that rules is violated in the so no new errors will creep a project of some just go a rule at a review the and either fix the errors or turn the rule off if it does not

have created an iphone app where you start in a navcontroller and after a couple of levels you select an option from the table and an animated view pops in that has a tabbarcontroller at its is a completely seperate view that replaces the you tab around and when you want to go back to the options screen you press back and another animated transition plays swapping back the navigation controller removing the tab bar controller and releasing problem comes with releasing the if you press the tab buttons to switch between tabs it seems you continually increase the reference count for the view then when you call release on the tabbarcontroller reference it will only release the view controller of the selected tab or any tabs you viewed and it takes one of the retain count on the others tabs this means you leak all your model custom cell objects etc from each of the other tabs that were not an example of what i am if you create a new template tabbarcontroller project in xcode and add a viewwillappear method to the first view controller that prints out the retain count for start the app and press back and forth on the first and second tab buttons and watch the log the retain count just keeps i am wondering if there is a way to release a tab bar controller and have it release all of its view controllers at the same for view controllers in tabbarcontroller releasing a

have had a few development managers who seem to understand or appreciate the difficulties of software design and managers believe that processes and methodologies completely solve the problem and i have a tough time explaining to them that it is not so and that you cannot read a book on the latest process fad and hope to get results by applying them as latest frustration i have is to convince my manager to give me requirements not but a larger set as far as give my team lead time to think about how to thrash out a few work out an implementation to plan out the tasks frustrations are compounded because of agile methodology and the interpretation of it that says not to do design against big design in product owner can change requirements at any time and so far i had much success and have to put up with the resulting you give me some arguments that can convince such are though not always at the end of every and the problems are brought but as i my manager appreciate the need for design lead time and the frustrations with have a problem with changing i understand that it will be but imagine you want a small feature to begin with and then you keep adding more around after a few the design cannot handle it anymore and a redesign is this could have been solved better with an upfront design in the first had the related features been investigated its not its the natural way of doing it i call software engineering common manager understand why i ask for time to redesign few times i just call it refactoring so that it fits the agile way of doing but it really is and not developing and demoing new to educate a development manager about the difficulties of software

have no idea why someone downvoted this it seems a perfectly valid question to maybe they just had their coffee yet this seem to be asking what iunknown and idispatch have to do with i will try to give a brief com component exposes a common iunknown has the methods and and are used to support reference so that when every reference to an object has been released the object will be is kind of like version of the operator in it is used by client code to see if the iunknow pointer they have actually points to an object of another like or every com component must implement but most com libraries will implement this for you automatically so when you are writing com code you typically have to write any code to get you get it for are kind of like just like in real life two people can have exactly the same in com two com components can also have the same for you can have 2 libraries that both implement the idog but they may do totally different you should still be able to have both libraries installed on your machine and distinguishing between the two is what guids are used a guid is a globally unique meaning that when you generate in theory no other person on earth at any othher point in time will ever be able to create the same so in addition to a every com object and has a is another base interface much like but unlike iunknown which is required for every com idispatch is and provides special functionality that many but not all com objects things like supporting certian language features and making your object easier to use by most com object expose this com they must be registered in

here is something that has caused some friction at my current job and i really expect it organized in house software development is a new concept here and i have drawn up a first draft of some coding have proposed that code should never be checked into the the reason i have stated this is that the repository maintains a full history of the if you are removing the functional code then remove it the repository keeps your changes so it is easy to see what was has caused some friction in that another developer believes that taking this route is too this developer would like to be able to comment out some code that he is working on but is this code then would never have been checked in before and then not saved we are going to be using tfs so i suggested that shelving the changes would be the most correct it was not accepted however because he would like to be able to checkin partial changes that may or may not be want to eventually get to a point where we are taking full advantage of continuous integration and automatically deploying to a development web currently there is no development version of web servers or database servers but that will all be changed what are your do you believe that code is useful to have in the very interested to hear from others on this clarity we use private if we did then say do what you want with your private branch but ever merge commented out code with the trunk or any shared is no valid reason we use private or per user not a concept i disagree we just set it up that way perhaps that is the eventual middle for now we use tfs in of

hope you will agree with me that every design element should have single is what do you think is purpose of if it is to identify unique record in a then surrogate keys wins without much this is simple and far as new columns in option 3 are you should check if these can be calculated would be to do calculation in model layer so that they can be changed easily than if calculation done in without too much of performance penalty from other for you can store segment number and road number in corresponding tables and then use them to generate this will allow to change asset numbering

humbly suggest that on some compilers on certain architectures the following could reduce more effectively than constant get many of the comments have a compiler will do a good job of optimizing a loop for you optimization people have spent lots and lots of time thinking about legible code is probably more but you really want to optimize beyond what you think a compiler may be able to i suggest looking at the assembly that the high level language and consider further optimizations from a high you may also be able to get significantly greater performance by using openmp or on a lower level by way of a vector instruction set to do multiple computations in a single a bit beyond the scope of the and have to give a lot more information about what the doing for useful advice on that helps	
	
hunch here is probably this task will be easier to accomplish by writing a virtual midi device instead of a vst it is possible to send midi events to a sequencer using the but the problem is that the documentation never specifies how the is required to react to these many hosts simply ignore and i certainly think of one which allows easy routing from a plugin to a midi channel plogue might be able to accomplish this with audio units with the plugin though never written such a my impression was that this is what use to generate midi to the but the problem here is that not sure how the host would allow you to route audio to the plugin and accept midi from any your idea implemented as a plugin will be the most difficult to implement when you want to standardize its behavior for the most widely used i think that a far easier way to accomplish what you want is to create a virtual midi as thought of and then use rewire to route an input signal to your some resources on writing midi drivers for various device driver programming in os midi driver api

i have a legacy php4 system that i continuously need to add features it look like there will be resources to do a port to php5 for several months if not several over the course of the past few one of the major things that has bothered me is not having the ability to throw exceptions because of all kinds of error checking code has to constantly interrupt the flow of going on to the what is the best strategy that you have seen to emulate the cleanliness of exception handling in languages that have no exception has this to say regarding exceptions as noted in an create too many possible exit points for a to write correct you really have to think about every possible code path through your every time you call a function that can raise an exception and catch it on the you create opportunities for surprise bugs caused by functions that terminated leaving data in an inconsistent or other code paths that you think better alternative is to have your functions return error values when things go and to deal with these no matter how verbose it might it is true that what should be a simple 3 line program often blossoms to 48 lines when you put in good error but and papering it over with exceptions does not make your program more i think the reason programmers in style languages have been attracted to exceptions is simply because the syntax does not have a concise way to call a function that returns multiple so hard to write a function that either produces a return value or returns an a good exception model in a language makes the called function specify that it will in fact throw an this implies that there are exaactly zero additional places for the function to exit from code would just return false instead of throwing an but there is exactly 1 additional place for the function to exit the catch block of the calling anyone write sloppy code that passes all exceptions upward to be dealt with by others but that mean you take away a tool that can be used cleanly and any function can return a value that is out of range of the expected return values from the calling a good programmer is going to deal with all possible return including error codes and the exception model just gives him a way to do it alternative exception handling

i think the largest hurdle learning so much as gaining experience in writing commercial windows software and web could argue that good development practices are and only can really be acquired through experience in actually developing a project that being my best advice would be to start learning and practicing object oriented design patterns and practices and then applying them to a specific designing and maintaining an website for would help you to experience the intricacies of developing with also give you insight into how to and interact with key operating systems such as you may quickly find is that mastery of in isolation for to build a half decent website you are likely going to have to also understand something of databases an alternative for data reading blogs and msdn articles can be very but usually applicable to the current flavours of the establish a specific goal to achieve and go about researching designs and strategies to implement check out some of the patterns and practices it covers a wide range of topics many of which include design patterns and strategies which may be helpful as you learn the there are also a lot of projects to be found on and take code project with a grain of

i understand it software being open source does not prevent you from selling it this depend on the type of but is this a good my pet project the target audience is for the most part who know how to compile the source but i still want to keep it open mostly for possible future employers to view my as well as to get critique from or just for others to learn expect to quit my day job from it or mostly just to defray minor costs like web domain and other misc and hopefully some pocket support really an and app and one of the primary objectives is to make it as easy to use as closest license that sounds like be friendly to this is the but google code which currently using support that and a quick search looks like sourceforge either could be currently but i just have a few classes stubbed out right so changing an there any examples of other people doing this or am i better off just asking for should i just not license it as open source it automatically closed source if i have any license but just distribute it upon any other options i thought what more interested aside from the legal aspect is whether the practice of straight selling open source software is generally frowned will i piss off customers that bought it and later found out it was open should i announce it on the site or keep a link from to retail site but not the other way announce it but not make it software as open source but charging for compiled

id uniquely identifies an element within the entire whereas a class name is like a many tags can be added to an and the tags can be a comparison can add multiple class names to an element separated by but you can only add a single can a class name on multiple but can use an id only once within an entire id can be used as a fragment identifier on the and the browser will scroll to that for it is not possible to do this with id makes it much easy and efficient to find a particular element in for in note that libraries like jquery make it possible to find elements by their class name but not nearly as properties of is possible for an element to contain both an id and a number of class and it or mean if the id is the same as one of the class iframes and traditional popup windows count as separate so it is possible to use the same id on elements within these different browsers do not follow the specification and allow for the same id to be used multiple and for it to behave in some ways like a class name but still work in for a css selector based on that id may match multiple elements as if it were a this is a really messy situation and you should never rely on be happy if browsers stopped trying to support

if only interested in the highest n occurring one way to do it is in two with the first pass based on a modified instead of using a bit map to track hash use an integer array instead either 16 32 bit or even 64 bit depending on your input where a bloom filter simply sets the bit corresponding to each of the hash values of a increment the count at the hash index in the problem with this approach is that two words will probably give the same hash so you need to do a second pass where you ignore words unless their hash totals are above a certain thus reducing the amount of memory you need to allocate to do accurate just create a bit map with bits set for the highest occurring hash then in the second pass of the if a word has in the bitmap for its look it up or add it to a hash table and increment its this minimises memory usage by creating a hash table of only the highest occurring

in many issues related to programming it all find that one really should first try to define your api so exceptional cases can not happen in the first design by contract can help in doing here one would insert functions that throw an error or crash and indicate a programming error user some cases these checks are removed in release keep you exceptions for generic failures that can not be avoided db connection optimistic transaction disk write exceptions should then typically not need to be caught until they reach the and will result in the user to need to try the error is a user error like a typo in a name or something then deal with that directly in the application interface code since this is then a common error it would need to be handle with a user friendly error message potentially translated layering is also useful so lets take the example of transfering cash from one account an other int int double amount this is an internal function we require the client to provide us valid arguments error handling done design by contract argument amount do the actual transfer int int double amount start string if msg return common checking code used from multiple if msg return if amount return amount this could fail with an exception if someone else changed the balance while this transaction was unlikely but return transfer	
	
in mind that just be cause one machine has more cpus running at a higher clock speed and memory than not necessarily going to solve a given problem faster than you provide possible that the machine has 8 each with a cpu a and 1 gb of local the second machine is a modern core 2 duo with 4gb of ddr2 each cpu in machine has a higher individual the netburst architecture is much slower than the core 2 if you have a light cpu but load that fit in the 1gb local to the cpu on the first your memory accesses may be much more expensive on the first machine they have to happen via the other the ddr2 on the core 2 machine is much quicker than the rdram in the frequency and total memory everything the cpu memory and cpu and memory hierarchy also it may be a much simpler answer as the other answers suggest sql server tripping over itself trying to parallelize the

in opinion is the best representation for a hierarchy in i mean by this on any given date you have a normal tree this hierarchy can change from day to each child still only has one parent on any given date any a child can join the hierarchy for the first or leave the hierarchy new and retired main the hierarchy the whole hierarchy across a date range on whole within the hierarchy on whole across a date range know how i do it at but am intrigued as to how other people may do it naively assumed a few considerations so will be more or will have a unique id in a dimension table elsewhere fact tables will use those ids performance for structure needs to facilitate historical reporting across date ranges of etl or triggers to maintain alternative structures is an option generic nature is most important just one part of a generic relational combined with ease of use for driving report any part of the tree across any range of and the ability to be updated relational database representation of time bound

is a complex there are infinitely many ways to interpolate a set of and this assuming that you truly do wish to do and not smoothing of any interpolant reproduces the original data points and of the nature of this problem makes things more are several common schemes for interpolation of scattered data in for those who have access to a very nice paper is available data tests of some mathematics of the most common method used is based on a triangulation of your merely build a triangulation of the domain from your data then any point inside the convex hull of the data must lie inside exactly one of the or it will be on a shared this allows you to interpolate linearly inside the if you are using then the function griddata is available for this express problem when trying to populate a complete rectangular image from scattered points is that very likely the data does not extend to the 4 corners of the in that a triangulation based scheme will since the corners of the array do not lie inside the convex hull of the scattered an alternative then is to use basis abbreviated there are many such schemes to be including when used by the geostatistics inpainting is the name for a scheme of interpolation where elements are given in an but where there are missing the name obviously refers to that done by an art conservator who needs to repair a tear or rip in a valuable piece of idea behind inpainting is typically to formulate a boundary value that define a partial differential equation on the region where there is a using the known boundary fill in the hole by solving the pde for the unknown this can be computationally intensive if there are a huge number of unknown since it typically requires the solution of at least a massive sparse system of linear if the pde is a nonlinear then it becomes a more intensive problem a reasonably good choice for the pde is the which results in a linear system that extrapolates i can offer a solution for a matlab choices for the pde may come from nonlinear once such is the it is well suited to modeling the types of surfaces typically but it is also more difficult to deal as in many facets of you get what you pay

is a container format and this use of it too it has the advantage of being relatively human readable except for the html you could try using cdata sections for one advantage of using xml for this is that you could use a dtd to validate that all languages have translations present for all make sure you encode the file using or and it probably helps if you put the encoding at the top of the recommend for how you load the xml data and incorporate it into the i know but the overall approach sounds the only downside i can see is that you have to release all the translations simultaneously to avoid this thing i note is that you use ch as the language code for should use that is the iso code for ch is shiny and

is a difficult i have changed my habit related to this question several times in the last so here are some thoughts coming to my mind the arguments in the constructor is like checking the arguments for a traditional so i would not differentiate the arguments of a method of course does help to ensure parameters passed are but also introduces a lot of more code you have to which not always pays off in my especially when you do write short methods which delegate quite frequently to other i guess you would end up with 50 of your code just doing parameter consider that very often when you write a unit test for your you want to have to pass in valid parameters for all quite often it does make sense to only pass those parameters important for the current test so having checks would slow you down in writing unit think this really depends on the what i ended up is to only write parameter checks when i know that the parameters do come from an external system user web or something like if data comes from my own i write tests most of the

is a found nothing interesting over the developing a memory management module for my we develop games for consoles ps3 and we consider pc a need in for our next to handle texture streaming for large game worlds that cannot be loaded all in main console memory talking about pc for are going to stream at the beginning mipmaps of textures is about of the size of world maybe in the future have to stream also smaller developing a memory manager for that focused on x360 over ps3 we can use host memory and the gmm problem facing is the we have decided to reserve a specific memory area for texture streaming example 64 and we want to handle all allocations and deallocations in that we have allocated the area at the beginning of the application and the area is physically guaranteed to be contiguous just cause we need to store textures implemented an auto defragmenting using handles instead of time is not an the problem is memory in game we continuously load and unload streaming so like to use the maximum amount of our buffer this allocator we can use all of the allocated space but the defragmentation routine works in an unaccettable time 60 more than a while the algorithm is not too there are just too meny unevitable looking for a solution to solve this like to find at least a good or a or someone who have faced the same problem of choosing between two move the defragmentation routine on a dedicated thread for x360 with 6 hw bad for ps3 with just a hw and tell me to use with all multithreading problems of locking of accessing a region who is being find an solution to defragmentation we can give each frame a time budget example up to 1 for defragmentation and the memory manager will do what it can do in the budget each someone tell me his experience memory management for texture streaming in

is a fun and exciting place to practice their examples start fairly light and work through extensive you want to take it that their approach is learn by here is a recursive function that i wrote to simply replace a for for string holder for index i holder return is the recursion to do the same we overload the first method to make sure it is used just like we also have another method to maintain our index to the way the for statement does it for you the recursive function must maintain their own string to call the recursive string int recursive to get a better idea of how this works without a for you can also replace this with the for loop it should do the same if return return index make recursive make a long story recursion is a good way to write less in the latter printbar notice that we have an if if our condition has been we will exit the recursion and return to the previous which returns to the previous if i sent in a i get i am hoping that with an example of a simple function that does the same thing as a for loop that maybe this will you can practice this more at java bat

is a really challenging problem to generate synthetic sounds that sound there are many techniques some some really to get good results you will have to use one of the more complex synthesis synthesis modulation distortion synthesis modeling are some synthesis methods taken from physical modeling can produce really good sounds but this shows in the complexity of the method the idea is the implementation should probably start with additive for this just add sine waves of the fundamental frequency and integer for example 440 1320 the amplitude should drop exponentially with the information about the structure of the components is best found in scientific papers about music instrument finally you must modulate the amplitude of the signal with an timevarying the structure for a guitar can be found in mentioned links from a guitar string and sound a really simple approximation of full physical modeling with differential maybe quite limited to guitar strings and similar but exactly what you are looking for and surely simpler to do than tuning a additive i will try it myself if i find some time over the really exited what one can get out of the

is a specfic however i believe that the model should be responsible for the validity of its own if this is the case then the validation belongs in the however this may not always be achievable and it may be necessary to perform validation in the however i think this should be in addition to the validation performed in the model not a replacement for problem with only having validation in the view is that at some point you will probably want another view on your your site may become popular and customers are asking for xml based apis to generate their own do you then rely on the customer to validate the if you do not have to provide apis some customers may want customized views that are sufficiently different to warrant a completely different version of the again you now have validation in the views think the ideal scenario is to have your model do the validation but to make the results of the validation available for the view to read and render the page again with the validation results think it is perfectly reasonable to have the view doing validation if you want to instantly display validation data back to the user etc but the final decision on data validity should rest with the

is also possible using the a specific example is available from the howto page titled mime and its mime i personally have used this technique in several programs to send html this work over you will need to get the users smtp or imap information and handle that communication yourself synapse library has routines to do just you decide to download i strongly suggest getting the latest version from the subversion the update available there includes support for delphi	
	
is also recommended because tomorrow if you want to cache the profile and when the number of users grow enormously high then you might need to cluster your application and that time this method can be you may create a different but addressing urls implicitly can create problems on longer as project and database it becomes too difficult to understand and manage what is going so even if you are creating a new you still should have which can be used for if you every link of microsoft has this

is done very easily using the property of the var tr var x var y approach allows you to only bind 1 event handler to the entire table and then figure out which table cell was this is known as event delegation and can be much more efficient in the right and this one fits the using this you avoid binding an event to each and it does not require if your table looks like will alert the coordinates on you can do whatever with you find performance to be too slow on just how large your table you would then have to resort to hardcoding or a combination of the maybe only hard coding the as that would be the slowest to and then getting the index if all this coordinate business is completely unnecessary and what you really just wanted was a reference to the clicked you would just do var td go

is essentially a problem that involves a number of discrete solutions to provide the full essentially there are 3 problems with sitting behind the advertised service endpoint of links to schemas that describe the data problem you the host as you have found solves 1 and 2 can approach this in ways other than host but no need to go into that number 3 is a bit more tricky and requires more code much to dump out short answer is that you need to write a contractbehavior that implements both icontractbehavior and important bit you need to implement is the within this method you need to iterate over all the wsdlport and when you find an extension that is of type soapaddressbinding you need to replace the property with a new uri that contains the https protocol you also need to do similar bits for the xsd import addresses and schema your service is also using you then need to do something similar to handle the additional addresses it writes out to the based the code i ended up writing on the wsdlextras project available on codeplex the method used in the wsdlextras provides a great base for any extra bits you may need to add to it memory i think it dealt with the the bit you want to look at is the soap address location

is good to keep one location in sync with a or in other mirror a to not what have to a to b and b to which brings a whole new set of if a file do you need to delete in on the other side or rsync it maybe it was modified on the other you the solution to this problem comes in the form of a tool on os cli gui and can be scheduled nicely in which will keep your home directory or any other directory nicely in and is made to be able to deal with almost any type of conflict or those people thought it all out way better than we could many people use scms for managing their home subversion is popular for but i recommend it at it will not only consume massive amounts of make everything horribly slow and force your keeping in sync on depending on an active connection to the master like and but they all have their any solution violates one very big rule of you should never keep big binary data in scms are not made for you keep your photo and stuff like that in an even though you may want to keep them in sync or keep a history on them so for important to understand that there is a difference between keeping backups and keeping in your backups should be kept in a location and can contain a history of everything you i personally recommend for it keeps history of everything uses the algorithm under the hood to minimize traffic and accessing the backup location looks like the most current state of the you can just browse through it like you do normal i recommend you combine and for an solution to keeping your data safe and reliably in	
	
is great because it handles many of the issues with different browser which if you familiar with can be quite the it also facilitates creation of the gui into a more programmatic manner which is also a big plus from a designer take a look at features live examples with to get an idea of the gui that you can easily use another nice feature is you can easily internationalize your application article for one way to do also when google compiles it they optimize the code which is a plenty of other libraries to add functionality easily as basically do anything you could have done with example shows you how to use javascript within you can even port javascript library into java and use them like you would any java google has done a pretty good job with it works wonderfully well in eclipse and is however it is the first web framework that gotten serious into so i think pretty good and may be something to note the hosted mode browser is essentially internet explorer so you do need to compile and view it in different

is hard to give an answer to this without seeing a lot more detail about what you are trying to i would not normally inherit from collection as it does not really give enough virtual methods to this can make altering the behaviour of your class a little tricky in the trouble with inheritance is that if you use it you will be stuck with the collection base behaviour forever or face a complex for you may want to add searching and sorting operations at which point you will need to switch to list from you may even want to do data binding where you will need a bindinglist instead of a different plan would be to inherit from icollection or better still and then delegate to a private collection this gives you maximum control and allows you to alter the internal representation of your class without affecting the public the trouble with this is that it takes longer to develop you what you are facing is a trade off between faster development and future and as i said at the start it is a bit difficult to judge which way to go from the information given in the original to make an implementation simply return true from isreadonly and then throw a notsupportedexception from all the methods that alter the

is how it works on you do you restrict exporting variables with gcc command line argument and explicitly flag exported entries with the visibility the executable will have a table of all functions it imports are all functions with default the will pick an address to load the libraries to and fill this table just before the calls to those functions are indirect that this holds for shared objects as static linking is performed on is after you the actual addresses are substituted in the and they are direct there is the thing called pic independent this deals with references to in the same shared so the linker overwrite half of the code of the library when loading the in the way that the code make any absolute references to its own you might try to experiment with

is very misleading and it seems to me that the author does understand the finer just that he appears to want to the key point that shows the flaw in argument is the operator standard defines that the above function has the following intentionally performs no other restate that this function performs no other this is very as it is the key to what placement new it is used to call the constructor for the and all it notice explicitly that the parameter is not even those without to summarise my everything that does in c can be done in using the only difference is that if you have non aggregate types that need to have their destructors and constructors then you need to call those constructor and such types do not explicitly exist in and so using the argument that does it is not if you have a struct in that has a special function which must be called with a corresponding then all points made by the author apply equally to that struct as they do to a some of his points implement multiple the compiler must actually change the values of pointers during some it know which value you eventually want when converting to a void no ordinary function can perform the role of malloc in is no suitable return is not again performs the role of a1 a2 b public public a2 foo void v new b b new placement new calls the constructor for delete v new int i delete i mention we need placement new to call the constructor for in the case of we can cast from to without a although again using placement new would improve type point he makes is about alignment returned by new will not necessarily meet the alignment requirements of a struct standard under pointer returned shall be suitably aligned so that it can be converted to pointer of any complete object type and then used to access the object or array in the storage allocated the storage is explicitly deallocated by a call to a corresponding deallocation to me appears pretty specialized allocators the author describes potential problems that you might you need to use the allocator as an argument to any types which allocate memory themselves and the constructed objects will need to have their destructors called how is this different to passing the allocator object through to an call for a c calling the in you can easily create a special kind of smart call it which we can define to call the destructor explicitly when it goes out of as a result we could if t arena foo new must be pfp new automatically last point i want to comment on is the comes with a operator defined as void void return noted not just implemented this way but it is required to be so by the obj be a class with a suppose you have sizeof bytes of memory somewhere and would like to construct 10 objects of type obj at that defines sizeof to be 10 sizeof can you do so with this placement operator for the following code would seem to do void return new serious this code is in there is no guarantee that the argument passed to operator really corresponds to the size of the array being as he highlights by supplying the the size argument is not used in the allocation the allocation function does and so the only affect of the above placement expression is to call the constructor for the 10 array elements as you would are other issues with this but not the one the author

it is really a binary and you have actual binary data in it embedded then you need to be careful not to use any of the members that can treat it as a c string with a terminating as you will obviously end up losing class is not really appropriate for this purpose it is written on the assumption that what you are working with is actually a string of characters since you are using a blob or array of binary a is probably more insert the data will require you to bind the content of the vector to the sql query using bind that is to instead of using to execute a string containing the sql you should use to create the statement handle you leave the spot where the value of the binary value would go with a then use to bind the placeholder to the binary you then call the function using are some code examples in the documentation

it just calls the other constructor as the first part of an alternative is to use which calls a constructor in the base class the language specification uses the term for this something like this if you specify equivalent to a call to in other equivalent both cases the base parameterless constructor is called before the body of the constructor is the compiler makes sure that you get into an infinite loop every class has to have at least one constructor which calls the base class you always end up calling the base class constructor before the constructor body for class in the instance variable initializers executed before the base class constructor my about constructor for more

java generics work by type so it only generates one class for all values of and translates all references to type in this class to the super type of in this case then uses virtual dispatch to provide the variance for calls to object and static dispatch to calls to static when you do the compiler does not make a global replace of with in all the compiler does is check that uses of as an argument or return type in the methods of are no change to any code inside so the same static method gets called whatever you want different behaviour in a generic class depending on the parameterised you have pass an object of that type in and use a virtual or pass in the class for the type and use

just to be how about something like apps left outer join on and and is joining the tables based on applicationid and the current since a left always get all the applications that match then you just filter out any results that get a match based on the holiday date being the current assuming that applicationname is always get a single row where the right half of the join is unless the current date matches a in which case the query will return no know how it stacks up with the other solutions i believe joins are generally supposed to be faster than but that probably depends on a variety of so

jython is not a suitable replacement for for that it provides no way to implement interfaces without writing the interface in java and then writing a class leveraging it in needed is a equivalent to boo is a language targeting the clr which is roughly inspired by python but not and which fully exposes the functionality being with there presently is no pythonic language with feature parity with java and such a language would necessarily be incompatible with as python simply provide a way to express some of the relevant concepts as interface typing there have been some questions about yet me is not a replacement for java in the sense that you take an arbitrary java decide to implement a random subset of that project in jython and not have anyone else on the development team know or jython is suitable for many of the same classes of projects that java when building an interface which will be called from rather than the given as tend to have a lot of components which operate closely with each being able to build a class with an arbitrary external interface is and is something which readily done in pure

kernighan was asked this question in a quote his torn on code tends to be bulky and very uninteresting and so it often gets in the way of learning and understanding the basic language at the same important to remind programmers that errors do happen and that their code has to be able to cope with personal preference is to pretty much ignore error handling in the earlier parts of a other than to mention that errors can and similarly to ignore errors in most examples in reference manuals unless the point of some section is but this can reinforce the unconscious belief that safe to ignore which is always a bad often leave off error handling in code examples here and on my own and noticed that this is the general trend on stack are we reinforcing bad should we spend more time polishing examples with error or does it just get in the way of illustrating the beginner the	
	
key is to adopt a practice of only deploying code from the source control not familiar with but it must implement the concepts of the question of what to deploy then falls out of the build and release tagging in the source control tips works best if you split the package spec and body into different files that use a consistent file pattern for each for package and for package if you use an automated build process that can process file patterns then you can build all of the specs and then the this also minimizes object invalidations if you are only deploying a package the time in to configure an automated build process that is driven from a release or build state of your source control if you have even a moderate number of db code objects it will pay to be able to build the code into a reference system and compare it to your qa or production

key thing to realise is that a uiscrollview is very intelligent about what it can move its subviews around and as long as the views that are visible on the screen do not move or there is no you can reset the frame of any offscreen subviews if necessary adjust the without causing a having paging enabled makes this a lot easier but sure you could do it from didscroll should generate your 5 views add them as subviews and set the offset of the scroll view to the center of the as the scrollview you can then switch the subviews around like a round there is no need to remove and the you can just reset the is a simple how a uitableview works too it reuses a small set of cell views and keeps resetting the content

know if this is the way to do but the first thing that comes to mind would be to make a custom subclass of which might look roughly like a just rough outline of the essential like i not sure if this really the way to do it if there is even a for that but this will give you a background image for your in response to comment not going to have enough room in that tiny little comment add the image into your drag it from wherever it is into the project window main list of files in the middle of the project although depending on how set up your xcode editing this might be different for order to subclass you would want to create a new class file new but edit the header so that the class inherits from instead of in other your header file might look like bgimagetextfield for the rest of the you would want to add that in the main body of the implementation file for specifically in between the and also like to mention two recommend picking up a copy of programming for mac os by aaron covers most of the cocoa basics that i just went and is one of the best ways to learn cocoa in although my approach probably not the best since i just recently found which seems to hint at a better way of extending

know that tempting to assign names to servers that describe their functions and other similar attributes and in a perfect world that will work but in practice i have found that after a while these things get messed up as functions and other parameters of the servers change the requirements of the business so the names no longer reflect the think you should assign unique names to the servers that do not tell anything about the function or other parameters and have some sort of to list detailing those things so that your people can look it what we do other extreme is using ip addresses only or having names based on ip addresses which can lead to a disaster too if you ever have to change your ip

little bit comment is accurate in that there is a little less bookkeeping to be but the emphasis is on rather than the material matched by has to be kept so that you can use the appropriate to refer to it in the the notation means that does not have to keep track of the match so it is doing a little less do you mean by track of the how does it affect can use escaped parentheses to parts of the matched for suppose playing with simple c function declarations no pointers to functions or other sources of parentheses then we might have a substitute command such as the an input line such char double output will int char double c might you want to do imagining that i need to wrap the c function so that it can be called from a language compiled to c that uses a different interface convention it is based on informix to be using it to get an example not because you really need to know why it was a good change to in the the and in the replacement text refer to the captured parts of the regular expression the function name sequence of alphanumerics starting with an alphabetic character counting underscore as and the function argument list between the but not including the used the notation around the function then would refer to the argument list and there would be no because would not have to keep track of one of the two captured parts of the regular it has marginally less bookkeeping to do than if it had to keep track of two captured as i the difference is you could probably never measure it in why the manual says allows more if you needed to group parts of your regular expression but need to refer to them then you could work with longer regular by the time you have more than 9 remembered parts to the regular your brain is usually doing gyrations and your fingers will make mistakes anyway so the effort is not usually worth but that i the argument for using the it matches the perl notation for a regular

look all that to since lots of languages have anything corresponding to the preprocessing reasonably accurate for a seem to be confusing virtual address space with disk file an adjunct to physical and works the same way for it uses the but not in the same way as using a know how physical memory virtual memory is a way of faking a larger memory in a way usually the file is divided into and the pages are read in from the disk as physical memory is divided into and the physical memory address have anything to do with the virtual address currently if the program uses more memory than is physically page frames will have to be so the contents of the page frame will have to be written back changed from when it was and a new page the program uses only part of its address space at a time and that part is few enough pages so they can all sit in physical memory at this works if constantly referring to more pages than can fit in physical pages constantly have to be read in from the disk performance drops and the disk is under constant when i have compiled and linked a an executable file on the in the file when i execute it gets assigned an address and then it gets more loaded into and how much physical and how much virtual memory is irrelevant to the user that if it have enough physical going to run awfully it is possible to run a 512m program with 256m of physical memory is requested from the it is assigned to memory at least the c and standard require that it be unless the request so looks to me to be an odd choice of it have to be in physical memory until

made this more browser friendly html public xhtml body 0 20px 0 div 0 1px solid the 90s we saw the rise of guis i know macs were around in the 80s but guis became the standard for everyone once windows took this transition had many casualties like lotus was basically killed by excel on and wordperfect word killed now you can argue that ms had the inside track since they also produced windows and be right but beyond that i think ms adjusted to the change quicker than anyone was still an agile little company back it adjusted and took its highly successful turbo pascal and created chapter 7 for further truly compiled languages ruled the roost in the 1990s with the exception of one little which was something basically it was sorta sorta interpreted compiled into bytecode that ran on a virtual i personally think that the rise of both java and netscape scared the absolute bejesus out of microsoft in the late chapter 9 for further adjusted reasonably well producing what was really the first really successful java ide in were fending off a resurgent microsoft who also produced successive versions of visual studio that were years ahead of their time in the late i can remember coding visual with mts transaction dcom objects over 10 years ago and that was a precursor to the modern application server platform we have remote debugging and the like were things that were at least light years ahead on visual in response to the text selection i tried it with absolute which you can do by changing this it still selects the only way i see around this is to change your page into a column format where the side notes are in other the only problem with this is that you lose the ability to move the notes in relation to the or at least i think of a way around

maintaining a legacy embedded device which interacts with the real this device collects data from processes the data using its internal and displays warning when data reaches a certain debugging we wish this device will send us on a regular basis many of the data it as well as the data after it processed reached to the conclusion that most of the data can be described in a tabular something along the lines obviously need to support more than one form of basically we need a protocol that is able to accept a certain set of tables description and then to deliver table data according to its example pseudo code for sending data table example pseudo code for receiving data case for case the tables could be done either off line both at the device and at the client computer communicating with or we can add a simple handshake protocol to agree upon format at the this is a legacy it supports only rs232 and since its cpu is pretty slow to we cannot afford using any data transfer those are too expensive or sending raw sql commands was also considered and rejected due to bandwidth too reduce the overhead of sending the table header each trying to avoid sending the table header each time sending so that each time sending a table just have to send the tables also would like to note that most of the data i wish to pass is so protocols are too seen protocol close enough but it support idea about a known protocol or implementation like what i any better idea to send this aware to the fact that this protocol is not very hard to i had in mind a two phase send the headers of all tables you wish to each table description would include information about the size of each send the table index to followed by the actual data will be followed by a i wish to avoid the small details of such and use some or even use an available format to pass tabular

martin by default most jms implementations will process message selectors on the they are part of a durable when jms implementations will process them on the server as well to avoid too many messages getting persisted when a significant reduction in the number of messages that get past the some systems allow you to specify that message selectors should be processed on the which is a good option in a case where you have excess cpu available on your message brokers but not on your in mind that while selection is usually it can be quite because if you want to listen to 5 different you have to have 5 different each of those in a naive driver implementation is a different and that can start to add for that it is often useful to support both from publication so that some clients can listen only to the topics that they and others can listen to the topic hierarchies they want with message selectors should always test against your application and your every broker handles the situation and every application functions you just say use technique because each technique for message processing has different thing to bear in mind with message selectors is that they dynamically so you have the possibility of losing messages or having to manually manage a complicated switchover imagine the following use are listening to a message selector of the form in wants to start listening to have to shut down the old messageconsumer and start a new one with a selector in the form in the you either lose messages you shut down the old one before starting the new or you have to manually remove duplicates you have the new one started before the old

miss having overloaded operators in especially in the following class that is an algorithm or a chain of the natural thing is to overload every programmer comes up with incompatible and thus names for so clarity is because these names forced to use make their meaning class that has a conversion to another in operator and works both for actual conversion and for yielding an internal member of the desired the second case comes up a lot in java when a class is unnecessarily final but you want to add operations to decoratedstringbuffer stringbuffer as string is private string public string final string public string other forwarding decoratedstringbuffer before it leaves your code and returns to the client it needs to be converted presumably by a function that finally applies the suffix and it would be great if we could call that operator even greater if like could apply one because no we have to give it a name that is necessarily more is one obvious but to many java imply a corresponding which we even if it imply the is the stringbuffer getting the one we operate or something is a better and the pattern i tend to but then someone reading the code wonders why what looks like a getter is called except in designing numerical classes or cocatenatable little use for overloading and as java like not much use for java trying to make everything act like a primitive int value and the conversion operators i

most java garbage collectors only run as as opposed to running on a schedule whether needed or in more memory causes less longer garbage generational garbage collectors have to control the allocation of memory between the young and tenured by setting these to use a smaller proportion of total memory for the young the absolute size of the young generation can be kept the same as the total heap size is you see much of a change in garbage collection frequency or you will have more room for objects for applications like

most visible way is for mapping class which does this will have unpredictable behavior when used as the key for a dictionary or the reason being is that the implementation uses both gethashcode and equals to properly find a value in the the short version of the algorithm is the the modulus of the hashcode by the number of buckets and the bucket for the specified key and every key in the particular there is a match that is the no match no to keep gethashcode and equals in sync will completely break this algorithm numerous

msdn article 6 improving it says the asynchronous calls unless you have additional parallel asynchronous calls from your web application only when your application has additional parallel work to perform while it waits for the completion of the asynchronous and the work performed by the asynchronous call is not cpu the asynchronous calls use a worker thread from the thread in you are using additional the same time that you make asynchronous such as calling a web method or performing file the thread that makes the call is released so that it can perform additional such as making other asynchronous calls or performing other parallel you can then wait for completion of all of those making several asynchronous calls that are not cpu bound and then letting them run simultaneously can improve is confusing to my understanding was that when you make an asynchronous call that no thread is used while but that an iocp is set with a reference to your callback is it true that you should only use async calls when you have parallel my understanding was that for an web it is often a good idea to change a webmethod to when you will be calling an bound operation and implement the whole thing someone help me understand what is meant by calls use a worker thread from the thread in you are using additional and the difference between workerthreads and implement an webmethod asynchronously if you can

mvc implementation would renders the data for the end user to see and gives them user interface objects to interact with the data not to handle that handles the user interaction and manipulation of data traveling between the views and the handles storage of data and the representation of that data for the frequent usage of the mvc pattern would be the rendering for the view portion of a web the language application level acting as the and mysql or a similar database acting as the model may or may not have some sort of orm framework in front of truth very few people use mvc in exactly this and for good reason my different applications have different needs and design requirements and beneficial to bend the patterns to what is these seems to describe more of the usage of a framework that isolates the layers of an application than the specific an employer what is really being looked for is that layer of abstraction and the experience that comes from building an a fairly sizable mental jump that happens when you move from working in an app that can be divided up not only into vertical features but into horizontal layers of features as a skinning is really just an aspect of one particular you can change the data sources at the model the methods of manipulating that data new algorithm for at the controller layer and roll them out gradually without having to change the other

my internship on interfacing i need to generate some very fast flickering squares on a crt monitor alternating between two the refresh rate is 85hz and we would like this to be the which means that repainting all squares can take at most language of preference for programming is so i tried making a prototype with because synchronous i now seem to have two the first is that time measurements show that the repainting of even 9 squares simply takes too my algorithm takes the desired frequency and calculates the times at which the system should repaint in advance and then uses a loop no that checks everytime if the next was reached and if loops through all the squares to repaint the way i implemented it now is that the squares are panels with background color a and are contained in another panel with background color b and the flickering happens because the visibility is i figured that this would be faster than one panel that has to draw rectangles all the have a decent profiling tool get eclipse tptp or netbeans profiler to so i be but i have the feeling that the bottleneck is actually not in the but in the looping conditional checking can you recommend anything about what i should second problem is that it seems like the squares are rendered like they unroll really but still this is what wondering is what causes is it or or just me writing a slow you recommend some things for me to i prefer to use but i will use c if i in this are there any for this sort of 2d programming that you can to generate simple 2d graphics in real

my project i have implemented the concept to share memory between two i have a server process in which i store the memory address of my session which contains details about a particular and i have a client process in which i read that address from the now the problem is the address is shown in the client process but some details are is my server process const char memory test is my client process const char memory test server process the variable contains all the details but in the client has some data no its still not changed and also still it doesn the test below shows the attached image which shows the contents of the variable in my server test below shows the attached image which shows the contents of the variable in my client do chech the difference i need the item data also visible in my client server test client test

my the greatest danger a team runs from measuring code coverage is that it rewards large and penalizes small if you have the choice between writing a single test that covers a large portion of your and writing ten small tests which test a single only measuring code coverage implies that you should write the large writing the set of 10 small tests will give you much less brittle and will test your application much more thoroughly than the one large test by measuring code particularly in an organization with still evolving testing you can often set up the wrong

my using vhdresizer and diskpart on a windows xp vhdresizer from these instructions from on this didnt on entering not sure on the exact wording but it was along the lines of cant extend this easiest way to do this long as you have enough hard drive is to extend your existing vhd using vhd expander which gives you two vhd the newly extended file will take the name of your existing you might want to and compact your vhd prior to extending your virtual pc 2007 go to your vhd as hard disk your newly extended vhd as hard disk your an command execute list select your new vhd volume by executing select volume where is your new vhd most likely execute you should see a success if not you may have to recreate your extended vhd due to an error in the by typing down the both vhd files from the hard disks your newly extended vhd as hard disk your will get a windows newly added hardware message after a short the vm when using your newly extended is information on extending volumes using the image virtual and virtual diskpart and expand the virtual disk disk 3 the number in the list part part 1 the number in the list part the new and save changes virtual and virtual can get download virtual server can do a custom install and only select more using with windows is not possible to use you can only use reason for this is that vhdmount uses vds virtual disk to assign a disk letter to the virtual hard disk after it is but vds is only included in windows server 2003 and this is not too big of an issue as unlike windows server windows xp will automatically mount the virtual hard disk when it is plugged this means that the only functionality you lose on windows xp is the ability to specify exactly which drive letter should be

nightly build process was broken for a long such that it generated pdb files that were a few hours different in age than the corresponding image i have since fixed the i would like to start using a symbol but cannot due to having to use these pdb i work around this issue by using the method in that means i have to organize all my pdb files by and after years upon years of that adds am looking for a way to modify the mechanism that windbg uses to mark a and force it to match my image the utility does something but for pdb the developer states on the page is capable of making an executable and pdb file match if they have different signatures but the same age this article for more information about pdb signature and if the age the tool cannot make the files took a look inside a and even found what looked like the bits corresponding to the but it must pull some more tricks cause i get it to know if this but in my particular case the age difference was caused by unnecessarily relinking which would recreate the pdb files as our build process was storing the original dlls the and the pdb after the i thought about somehow recreating such a situation by forcing a relink on a but saving off the pdb in both then i could do a binary compare of the two files to see how they perhaps run some sort of patching software that does this by seeing what exactly changed in my control perhaps i could do the same to the dlls and pdbs saved in my companies build figured it thanks to one of the comments on the first i checked out a link to the pdfs of the book windows 2000 a programmers and the author goes into great detail about the pdb file as i said i had already loaded the pdb into a hex editor and flipped some bits around appearing that i made the but it after using the utility from the w2k secrets book to the pdb into the included i found out that they hide another reference to the age in stream once i flipped that one as it matched up in this is thank you so server here i can you change an pdb to match

nonsense thanks for i made a hash of the first updated question as the use of has been pointed out as not necessary by trying to achieve here is a deep copy using strong i want to be able to copy class2 to another instance of i also want to use the copyto function from the class1 which is the this idea comes from my where usually just make the return type generic write data in to c1 from this class2 inherits class2 new class2 return the way so it in class t where t remember the best way to do this in basically if t was class2 this would need to a new instance of that and the same goes t copy copy the data from this to return compared to the the snippet feel is it possible to do this without or is this way best i be using for	
	
normally need to do things that the average person and so should normally have administrator making them hop through awkward hoops wastes their time and demoralizes there may be exceptions in but if you trust somebody with an admin account you sure trust their should also have an available account of the same permission as their users than one account if the pool of users has different permission they may just develop something deploy and then find it work for the are also too many ways to screw up computers with admin accounts done the it department needs a policy that they will a computer if they fix it at one place i contracted i had to sign a copy of that policy to get my admin is a pretty in linux and other developers can more often get by with user accounts often need another account for test got an account they can sudo they do know when using the but they may need one with the same group and can do incredible amounts of damage to the os very so the same it policy is

not a really good reason not to map the simply adding the mapping will give you the best you use a named query to directly inject results into an unmapped you would need to tell it which columns to put into which fields or in other a you can return scalar values from a named query and you could take those object arrays and build your collection

not entirely sure how to post this but here have a web app that has a list of sortable i sort them ajax style using that works like a i can drag and drop the items till my heart is the same there is a button that allows for the creation of new items on my this is also ajaxified and works for the most the new item appears on my list and firebug shows that the code being rendered is exactly the same as the other list oh and it is contained in the correct problem is that the new item is not i do anything with it unless i refresh the any ideas why this is the case or how i can get around really like to solve tried to paste code in but quite make it so i went with here is the code for a page with 2 sortable this is a fresh load and everything works as this i have clicked the button that creates a new but not so the first 2 sections are but the new one is using ruby and rails to do the ajaxing here and not very familiar with how it should but i believe this behavior comes from and maybe adding item to sortable

not familiar with google protocol but my interpretation of the documentation if the value cannot be if the value is pretty much as likely to be negative as not some fuzzy definition of likely to if the value could be but much less likely than the value being positive if the application sometimes uses to indicate an error or value and this is a relatively uncommon what the docs have to say about the encodings is an important difference between the signed int types and and the int types and when it comes to encoding negative if you use or as the type for a negative the resulting is always ten bytes long it treated like a very large unsigned if you use one of the signed the resulting uses zigzag which is much more encoding maps signed integers to unsigned integers so that numbers with a small absolute value have a small encoded value it does this in a way that back and forth through the positive and negative so that is encoded as 1 is encoded as is encoded as and so it looks like even if your use of negative numbers is as long as the magnitude of the numbers passing in the protocol is on the smaller you might be better off using if profiling would be in

not saying that and is not insane horace but i am saying that there is a sane way to expect this i am dealing with i am focused on the elements in the array the index because the index is the method is each with or or this is also consistent with the index being viewed as an optional is equivalent to which is consistent with i am dealing with i am often more focused on the keys than the and i am usually dealing with keys and values in that either or you want then either explicitly use a defined method as brent longborough or an implicit method as maxhawkins is all about accommodating the language to suit the not about the programmer accommodating to suit the this is why there are so many there are so many ways to think about in you choose the closest and the rest of the code usually falls out extremely neatly and for the original is the way to iterate through an array in i think the core way without powerful syntactic sugar or object oriented is to index in 0 puts ruby is all about powerful syntactic sugar and object oriented but anyway here is the equivalent for and the keys can be ordered or key in puts my answer way to iterate through an array in ruby depends on you the programmer or the programming and the the better ruby programmer makes the better choice which syntactic power which object oriented the better ruby programmer continues to look for more i want to ask another is the way to iterate through a range in ruby question is how i came to this is nice to do the puts i like to do the puts i actually mind doing that too but when i am teaching going i want to show my students a nice symmetry with minimal only adding a or a step but without modifying anything can do puts puts i like but you puts puts puts puts puts puts i want this could ultimately def i want to teach pure ruby rather than object oriented approaches i would like to iterate creating an array for any range not just using any extra object oriented power no class believe this is impossible without defining a which means modifying the range class to use if you can do this please let me otherwise confirmation of impossibility would be appreciated though it would be perhaps ruby addresses for your time in reading

not sure about a hash function that does exactly what you are asking but it seems that a structure similar to how git stores its revisions might do what you need was inspired by how monotone stored its computes the sum of each of the files in the these are used as blob it then has a which maps filenames to blob ids other for the identifier of a tree is its its not relevant to your i the trees are then referred to by which include things like and one or more parent means that you have to the sum for each blob as you update you just recompute the for the blob that and recompute the for the could do the same with your compute the hash of each of your and put all your mappings into one and compute the hash of if the file containing is too big for you to want to it each you could divide it into and have a where each section had one level of branching should generally be sufficient for most but you can build a tree structure out of these if you really need

not sure if anybody has spelled it out exactly this but you need to understand the is no element in a as others have sets have no a set is a mathematical concept that specifically does not include your computer really keep a list of stuff not ordered in it has to have some internally an array or a linked list or but you really know what it and it really have a first the element that comes out comes out that way by and might not be first next even if you took steps to a particular first still coming out by because you just happened to get it right for one particular implementation of a a different implementation might not work that way with what you in you may not know the implementation using as well as you think you run into this with rdbms systems and an rdbms query returns a set of this is the same type of set from an unordered collection of only in this case the items are an rdbms query result has no guaranteed order at all unless you use the order by but all the time people assume it does and then trip themselves up some day when the shape of their data or code changes slightly and triggers the query optimizer to work a different way and suddenly the results come out in the order they these are typically the people who pay attention in database class when reading the documentation or when it was explained to up that query results do not have a guaranteed

not very experienced in database but my feeling is if your business classes are well the only point where you access the databse is in your repositories a change in the database is just a change in the implementation of your bad database design will make your repository hard to and slow to but it will not impact your business layer of your you try to modify your business layer because of your dao why not to modify your business layer because of your presentation layer and then good luck to satisfy all constraint and good think that both are but coding and database design should not be in the same more important for the developer is to isolate himself from the work of the db if the db designer and the developer are the same you should not have to think about two thing at the same

nothing in the framework supports have to do a search for the tags then use reflection to access the appropriate properties in your order easier way would be to dump your order into a some pseudocode which might actually work as hashy o in orders where id select new this all you need to do is get the string from your text file and index into your linq to sql like list initializers in you might be able to wrap this in a method not little modification and you get this working hashy o in orders where id select new not as elegant because tripping the linq call via which will pull back all the in the its probably best just to pull out your stuff the information you need in a then process your text have to recompile if your database its not as elegant as my first	
	
nothing in the to do this though it uses an underlying no api to manipulate it and the is would probably be best off by just and calling it directly with your intptr browse of the looks like you could get away with creating a and then setting field to your but that requires and if your socket is already connected it sounds like it is since you just asked about calling then also have to manipulate the private state of socket which makes this idea even less palatable and more	
	
nothing inherently wrong with using session state in an web as long as you use it sparingly and pay attention to good design for it make sense to cache large objects in session state and then use sql server to manage session you will be large amounts of data from a database which defeats the objective of caching it in the first using session state to store some primitives between pages seems ok to	
	
nothing to do with the cpu it maps it into virtual address and if subsequently or locked with then it brings it physically into what cpu caches in or not in is nothing you really have control over not via touching the pages is necessary to cause it to be mapped but if you do a mlock or that would have the same effect are usually far as the overhead is i really have to measure my guess is that a which load pages in is more or less a constant time but bringing the pages in will take longer with more versions of linux also support a flag which instructs mmap to load the pages in immediately only if

now programmers think of source code control as integrating packets of but why not make those packets smaller and integrate would say dvcs are already basically doing this not because they are but because commiting is so much with git i commit far more often than with it also makes it simple to commit or specific of code add or and is generally much more focused on tracking lines of rather than complete files like the way git inherently works as you changes would be saved as checked of when you the changes are then you push them to the remote machine with a separate you could commit every time you then rebase them into a single commit if you for a tool that does version you could do this quite simply with a shell something 1 git add git commit at sleep is a which does something watches a specific and commits all the changes to a standalone git use just not sure why want to do i find one of the most useful things about using a vcs is the diff of what changed the last it seems like having commits would just be the text has an interesting it visualises the undo with there is a on with

observed that message before but i think it was the same cause the not is a generic rpc error which can be caused by many our particular it was because we were hammering wmi too hard and not cleaning up our but it appears to be a different cause in your know you said you want to shorten the parameter but that may be the only way forward for having a hard time visualizing the circumstances under which you need to send 6m across an rpc perhaps if you explain the reasons behind we can help possibilities based on comments to the rpc calls limit the amount of data that travels across the this could be done by segmenting the message at the source and reconstructing it at the such as having three parameters could have the server dole out message identifiers in another rpc call or find some other way to ensure no two clients have the same a message identifier tying message segments a last flag begin the reconstruction a limited size segment xml is ripe for the 7zip libraries are the best seen in terms of size whether this would be fast enough is another fix by changing the out the registry area for the rpcmaxsize there are a couple of sites googled that suggest setting this to will remove size limitations so be fix while registering your can apparently achieve the same effect as on a specific interface with

of the problems with statics is that you have no control over when they are instantiated as your program is in debug the compiler does many things differently than it does in release one of those things is how it manages is quite likely that you are simply getting lucky in debug that your memory is not being overwritten by other processes and the value is there when your program wants approach used to great effect is a variation of the meyers is very nicely detailed in in the singleton pattern you are not after a the approach can be used to solve your problem as static const static return primary benefit is very nicely explained by nakamura in the above construction relies on the fact that objects are only initialized when the function is first being called thus we maintain the benefit of dynamic primitive variables like static int do get translated during compile time

on to what veefu templates in are not like generics topic is tagged as so i assume you are comparing them in the actual code is not generated at but only at so that if you have a class with a template in you either must have it in a header or you must instantiate exactly which instances of it or else get a linker error because it find what looking because it was never actually when doing the compiler actually makes as many of your template class as you have instantiated different of the so from the if you have and the compiler actually outputs the code for 3 different this is why templated classes are defined in header files and not in compiled because the compiler needs to generate what is in contrast to generics in java where references are and you can only use what you have specified the generic to be inherited or from you need to declare that something implements icomparable to use any of the methods from or whatever other restrictions you put on when you use a a to ensure type but actually the is in that if you have a class with a templated then depending on the size of that the resultant class will be bigger or which affects the actual size of the hope that made some though it was a bit i actually know you could do templated functions as mch

only way i think this is achievable is through something similar to multiversion concurrency protocol used in databases such as this guarantees that readers block writers block but writers block only those writers which update the same piece of this property of writers blocking the which update the same piece of data is important in concurrent programming otherwise inconsistencies are for each and every write operation to the data structure you take a snapshot of the data structure or atleast the portion of the nodes affected by the write operation to a different location in the memory before doing the so when the write is in a reader thread requests to read a portion of data from the writer you always refer to the latest snapshot iterate over that there by providing consistent view of data to all the are costly since they consume more but yes for your given this technique is the right one to go and yes use locks to protect the write operation from other writer needing to update the same piece of	
	
only way to answer your question is to give pros and cons for each design going for is best when there is minimal for stateless data examples for procedural processing would all kinds of mathematical string array direct memory access and the is great for state it is great to use oop for things like ui elements of textbook socket programming other protocol implementations also anything that involves and implements itself is a common practice to mix functions for simple processing with complex state controls in methods in classes would be using functions for their internal data something together might work for the but after multiple upgrades you might end up looking for spaghetti sauce for your it is always good to have a deliberate design for the code as opposed to aspect is the practice in the if it is a common practice in zend framework to have mixed implementations and functional for simple there is little reason not if it is better stick with one otherwise you will face maintainability issues and other people will have to spend hours and days understanding your is also necessary to explore every bit of of doing whatever you compiler opposed to and linking is make sure there are no problems your code is split into modules be sure to check that mixing things will not break there are performance quantify once you decision might become many test applications to verify your choices unexpected slow start data jumping over hoops to get things done all indicate that the choice is not knowing is as important as knowing

operating system an growing document that is being produced by ieee and standardized by ansi and the goal of posix is the portability of practical the goal is defined as the ability to write one source implementation and have it run on different systems with only is a compiler capable of delivering that promise and as it needs a layer of code that brings a machine posix is the core of the answer to your help see what i offer you this a program with no that takes as input from the user some directory path and writes to stdout a listing of its contents think you will find that it is very difficult to write code that uses only the native win32 api that compiles on any unix or linux system will be only slightly less difficult to write code that uses posix api as you can on any linux box and have it compile under windows has a surprising number of headers might be able to get you linux program from above and now compile it under gcc running under cygwin or bet it compiles and did gcc perform that bit of the posix headers and implementations underlying them provided by cygwin or reliance on under windows make more sense programming for the real bill pg

optimization tricks use are generally the same tricks use for a normal just with a faster turn around some things you can look into doing get requests that have high odds of being loaded by the a caching layer in between as mitch wheat depending on your technology you can look into quite common and there are libraries for just about at denormalizing data that is going to be queried at a very high assuming that reads are more common than you should get a decent performance boost if you move the workload to the write portion of the data access opposed to adding database load via delayed inserts to give priority to writes and let the database server optimize the sure you have intelligent indexes on the table and figure out what benefit if rebuilding the indexes very frequently due to a high you may want to scale back the at retrieving data in more general queries and filtering the data when it makes to the business layer of the mysql uses a very specific query cache that matches against a specific it might make sense to pull all results for a given even if only going to be displaying look at running asynchronous queries to the database if possible within your data synchronization to be it just needs to appear that way of the common pages on in a fully formatted state so that the server have to do much processing of in there are of things you can do they generally come down to general development practices on a more bite sized

others have controlled by the operating depending on the it may or may not provide you with system calls that allow you to affect what core a given process executes you should usually just let the os do the default if you have a system with 37 processes and 34 of those processes are going to schedule the remaining 3 active processes onto separate likely only see a speed boost on playing with core affinities in very specialized multithreaded for suppose you have a system with 2 suppose you have an application with 3 and two of threads operate heavily on the same set of whereas the third thread uses a different set of in this you would benefit the most by having the two threads which interact on the same processor and the third thread on the other since then they can share a the os has no idea what memory each thread needs to so it may not allocate threads to cores interested in the operating read up on the nitty gritty details of multiprocessing on x86 can be found in the 64 and architectures software volume chapters 7 and 8 contain relevant but bear in mind these manuals are extremely

playing with this a and seeing the caveats with allocconsole and i think the best idea is to have two exe say and when you need console use of your code other than your main function can be placed into a project which produces a dll this includes all win including your main the only thing left in the exe project is a small main function which in turn calls a static function in your all of this can be done without resorting to your dll class public class private static bool misconsole private public static bool get return public static int bool misconsole do whatever main program return dos return catch if return dos return code indicating your project which emits a windows exe this is the only static class static int return your project which emits a console exe this is the only static class static int return in both exe you need a reference to the dll project in the same on the application tab of project you can change the project type windows app console app or class library that it is possible to programatically determine if an exe file uses the windows or console but it is probably not worth it lots of and you have to look at the bytes of the exe pe the methods are funny in that if you run your program from the command line or a batch and try to redirect the output to a it wil not work it will not go to the see possible to work but it requires more and probably not worth a best i never put more into an exe project than the simple main function that in turn calls a static function in a there are a lot of but one good reason is that unit testing tools work better with dlls than with also the form of the main function which takes a string array of and returns an this is the best form to because you can use errorlevel in batch files to work with whatever number your exe returns traditionally 0 for success and larger than 0 for

point of seaside is not really to be like desktop though it does try to take much of the pain out of web seaside is known for two things which you might consider continuations to allow you to write processes that prompt the user for blocks to provide into your code whenever links are forms things vastly simplify certain web development though the first ends up being used fairly infrequently in provides many other ability to write web applications in smalltalk productive and reusable can delegate to other which replaces just that part of the management of session state and certain state can be marked to be rolled back whenever the user uses the back button so it always has the correct value when callbacks are very nice canvas api for programatically generating ability to debug and fix errors live on a running of these are not unique to seaside but they are somewhat so how is it different from other web you get to write in you have to mentally back and forth between code and a templating you have to worry about form field you want you probably hate web programming as much if you use may discover seaside because of its programming but they usually hang around for all the other	
	
point to daniel disadvantage of anonymous inner classes is that no one can ever use it anywhere whereas a named inner class can be used only by the class that created it if made a small but it does mean that you can help ensure that an inner class is not accidentally recreated using the anonymous inner class gives anyone reading your code a harder time as they then have to parse this class that came out of using a named inner class you are able to organize the source have seen cases where there are two anonymous inner classes with the exact same in guis especially you may have multiple controls performing the same this can crop up i am talking production not code that my students have readability issue goes both some people find anonymous inner classes better as it lets you see what is going on in once others find it a that part comes down to personal making an class static is more if you are declaring an anonymous inner class in an instance then there will be more if you need access to the instance is wasteful probably not worth worrying about until it presents as a personal preference is to use classes as they allow for more flexibility when the code is modified	
	
pointed out by pete this is implementation my answer is only correct for the sun and only prior to java 7 update right about a normal call just creating a new string referring to the same character array as the original what happens on line 5 the fact that the new string object reference happens to be assigned to a variable change the behaviour of the to be you say that in line 2 the new string will still point to the char array reference inside the string will be to the same char array as one used for but is a string in not a char in other by the time line 2 has finished ignoring there are two string both referring to the same char one has a count of 6 and the other has a count of both have an offset of wrong about line 4 using a though no pooling going on it is different to the other when you call the the new string takes a of the character data of the so completely this can be very useful if you only need a string which contains a small part of a very large original it allows the original large char array to be garbage collected nothing else needs while you hold onto the copy of the small a good example of this in my own experience is reading lines from a by will read lines using an so every string returned will use a char array of at least 80 if reading lots of very short lines the difference in terms of memory consumption just through the use of the new be very that

post in using a history table per base table and a comment by karl about possible performance done a bit of sql research in order to figure out the fastest possible way to transfer a record from one table to just wanted to document what i thought that i would have to do an sql fetch to load the record from the base followed with an sql push to put the record into the history followed by an update to the base table to insert the changed total of 3 to my surprise i realized that you can do the first two transactions using one sql statement using the select into betting performance would be a hundred fold faster doing that would leave us to simply update the record with the new data within the base still found one sql statement to do all 3 transactions at once doubt i

power of two number can be represent in binary with a single 1 and multiple you subtract 1 from any power of two you will get all 1s to the right of where the original one 1 these two numbers will give you 0 every the case of a of two subtracting one will leave at least one unchanged somewhere in the number 1 these two will result in

preference would be c or because not separated from the machine language by a jit want to do intense performance and that means stepping through the hot spots one instruction at a time to see what it is and then tweaking the source code so as to generate optimal you get the compiler to generate what you consider good enough assembler then by all means write your own assembler for the hot describing a situation where the need for performance is i would not do if i were in your shoes is rely on anecdotal generalizations about one language being faster or slower than what i would do is multiple passes of intense performance tuning along the lines of and and i have done this sort of thing numerous and the key is to iterate the cycle of because every slug fixed makes the remaining ones more until you literally squeeze another cycle out of that is it the case that there is some configuration information that determines how the bulk of the data is if it may be that the program is spending a lot of its time the configuration info to figure out what to do if it is usually a big win to write a that will read the configuration info and generate an program that can whizz through the data without constantly having to figure out what to

pretty much agree with all that carl meyer wonder how stack overflow handles original question give much specific information about the intended use expected load requests per hosting assuming that the load is i would recommend using just apache with or apache with and s3 for static file recently became the recommended way to deploy see given this you should expect this method to see a lot of and therefore a lot of and blog graham dumpleton also recently release which looks quite mature used it can put nginx in front of apache to proxy dynamic and serve static this setup serves many people the nginx wiki has good tutorials on setting this but this also gives you two sets of config files to and two http servers to keep only you could use apache to serve static use in deamon mode to handle then split up the requests by url so that static file requests do not invoke the wsgi django but are handled by apache this is again well see your favorite apache book for location or see the apache this at least your so that you only need to learn apache and to keep apache simple way to go would be to use apache for all dynamic django and put all static content on amazon depending on your expected use frequency of updating static this might be the very amazon lists a couple of freeware applications to make working with s3 such as bucket explorer

public except for classes that are essentially just not a good practice to get defined the class you might never be able to change it than adding to because people will build on it and rely on making a variable public means that you need to have that and you need to make sure it has what the user if you use a promising to supply some which is currently kept in that if the situation and rather not maintain that variable all the you can change the if the requirements change seen some pretty odd requirements and you mostly need the name in this variable but sometimes the one in that you can just change the if you made the variable be stuck with always but i find it a lot easier just to write a quick getter than to analyze the situation to see if regret making the variable public risk being wrong member variables private is a good habit to get any shop that has code standards is probably going to forbid making the occasional member variable and any shop with code reviews is likely to criticize you for it really matter for ease of get into the safer

purpose of a supervision tree is to manage the processes not necessarily forward there is no reason you use different code to send requests directly to members of the list of available see the or functions for one way to get those can let the pool module handle the management of the processes and killing and use some other module to transparently redirect requests to the pool of maybe you were looking for distributed pools be hard to get away from the master process in erlang whithout going to distributed the whole running system is pretty much one large supervision

question below is based on the assumption that controls are always binded to data source controls in the order they are so in our example sqldatasource1 will connect to data source prior to sqldatasource2 and thus will be populated with values before and reason for that being that was declared before if then when exactly does retrieve a value from i assume after event handler and before event but when it is a then those parameters will get loaded from a viewstate on the in the order they are assume controlparameter is bound to property c1 of a control i would imagine that on postbacks controlproperty would always be able to get value from no matter of what type c and even if c has viewstate but may i ask if a page is created for the first a value for controlparameter also be retrieved from the moment lstcities retrieves data from data has its value apologize for not replying but i realize and when i spent good 20 minutes trying to get my 3 braincells to work but not sure if i quite so controlparameter evaluates and thus retrieves value after c has been controlparameter only reads its own state and only to determine if it so controlparameter checks whether its viewstate changed in order to fire onparameterchanged before binding takes place thus it checks its viewstate during how will controlparameter know that its viewstate has changed it will know on first postback from the first time the page is created viewstate will always be marked as so how from one postback to controlparameter know whether its value has changed between i assume controlparameter checks whether its viewstate changed only so that it can fire onparameterchanged but why is handling that event so first time a property evaluation happens is on property evaluation you mean controlparameter checking its own thus you mean controlparameter evaluating which i assume happens after c has been bound really appreciate your really sorry for again taking your will do my best to make this my last is called both in onloadcomplete and when data binding takes inside the following sentence is also if is called when data binding takes then what that means that when on next postback is called in and controlparameter will already have same values and thus if null storedvalue null actualvalue always return false when is called in onloadcomplete and so onparameterchanged event will never get if the i fail to see the need to call in controls are always binded to data source controls in the order they are declared

question is does not work at a it works a a volume and you will have a device path which you can using the filesystem api will automatically mount the device volume with a on a file by file or you can access the device directly by should be easy to backup all files on the snapped device volume forget all of the file streams and for ntfs your problem will be restoring vss will not help you on the the main problem will be restoring a system where you will need another os to boot to like winpe or dos or something if your not worried about system volumes then restore can be you backup the data in terms of then you get the added benefit that if you write a volume device driver for it look like a volume or then windows will a filesystem driver for this gives you a free explorer this is what most sector based backup applications also it gives them vm if you are doing simple file it helps to understand filesystems so that you know what you backup and do you know what a ntfs reparse point how are you going to deal with it if you hit one during your do you know how windows actually boots and what files you need to backup and restore and to be able to have a chance at on a how best do you lay out the ntfs volume as not to affect ntfs performance on the restored are you going to support restoring system volumes to new what does that require you to do just to have a chance of the questions are is not there are lots of edge cases some of the questions that you know about until you hit luck on you i hope i put you off too just saying there is a lot of work to be able to deliver a backup application that most people have have no idea

question is long winded because i have been updating the question over a very long time trying to get ssis to properly export excel managed to solve this although not aside from someone providing a correct the solution listed in this question is not only answer i found was to create a row named wide enough for my in the named range sample data and hide appends the data and reads metadata from the single is close enough for it to drop stuff in data takes the format of the hidden single this allows what a pain in the it will take over 450 days of exports to recover the time i still love ssis and will continue to use it because it is still way better than filemaker my next attempt will be doing the same thing in the report question you are in sql server integrations services designer and want to export data to an excel file starting on something other than the first lets say the forth how do you specify tried going in to the excel destination of the data changed the accessmode to openrowset from then set the variable to this fails saying it cannot find the the sheet is called thought you could specify in excel you can select a set of cells and name them with the name this allows you to select the name instead of the sheet without the dollar oddly whatever the range you it appends the data to the next row after the as you add it increases the named row odd thing is the data takes the format of the last line of the range my header rows are if i specify a range that ends with the header the data appends to the row and makes all the entries if you specify one row it puts a blank line between the header row and the but the data is not matter what i ssis samples the of the file and sets the metadata according to what it if you have sample data that has a value of zero but is formatted as the first it treats that column as text and inserts numeric values with a single quote in front i also tried headers that do not reflect the data types of the i tried changing the metadata of the excel but it always changes it back when i run the then fails saying it will truncate if i tell it to ignore it imports everything except that days of several hours a piece tried every a mostly working example is to create the named range starting with the column format your column headers as you want the data to look as the data takes on this in my these exist from a4 to which is my defined ssis appends to the row after the defined so defining a4 to e68 appends the rows starting at you define the connection as having the first row contains the field it takes on the metadata of the header not the second and it guesses at the data not the formatted data type of the headers are so all my metadata is if your headers are so is all of your even tried making a sample data row without i think anyone actually uses excel with the default ms ssis you could define the to with no header row and format those columns not without it skipping a row in this would be very from what i noone uses ssis to export excel without a third party connection ideas on how to set this up properly so that data is formatted the metadata read from excel is proper to the real and formatting inherits from the first row of not the headers in last update got this to work very one thing i added to excel was the in the excel connection this forces excel to look at all rows to see what kind of data is in this does not drop say for instance if you have a zip code then about 9 rows down you have a excel without this blanks that field entirely without with it recognizes that zip is actually a character field instead of of one more update will succeed importing data with missing contents in the first 8 but it will fail exporting data where no data have it on your import connection but not your export excel connection have to after so much it works pretty if you are using a x64 bit make sure you call the dtexec from sql it will load the 32 bit excel driver and work to export ssis to microsoft excel without additional

question is what is a deadlock or a wrong finanical deadlocks are far worse than wrong i know that sounds but hear me the traditional example of db transactions is you update two subtracting from one and adding to that is a financial database you use business that means adding one row to each it is of upmost importance that these transactions complete and the rows are successfully the account balance temporarily wrong a big that is what the end of day reconciliation is and an overdraft from an account is far more likely to occur because two atms are being used at once than because of a uncommitted read from a sql server 2005 fixed most of the bugs that made nolock so unless you are using sql server 2000 or you need info on row level	
	
question very clear so going to assume that doing some kind of image processing and the results you get are values from to 1000 and now you need to save the color to a file where every value needs to be between 0 and you do this is really very dependent in the what is really the meaning of the results and what exactly you want to the two main options the values anything under 0 you replace by 0 and anything above 255 you replace by want to do this for instnace if your image processing is some kind of interpolation which really reach these normalization linearly may your minimal value to 0 and your maximal value to of course first need to find the minimum and you this does is first map the values to and then stretch them back to third option is to mix and match between these two your application might demand that you treat negative values as unneeded values and clamp them to 0 and positive values to linearly map to

real code you are referring to is usually called a good unit testing your unit tests should be in their own classes probably their own so that be an rest is language based for the most the more advanced a the better ability to avoid writing support code to some a development system can help you avoid writing a lot of code screen ruby on but these abstractions can break down and cause you to write just as much code as anything else if you use it to develop targets outside intended types of ruby help all that much if calculating prime the you have art of eliminating all the supporting code that you can well as redundancies in your business to keep your clean and practicing advanced probably end up writing tools for abstracting data out of your code and into a structured file of some sort can eliminate huge piles of support code and move the rest into because now parsing that data and setting it up is part of the your program is a good because this type of business logic tends to be more readable and easier to the other advantage of this kind of abstraction is that all your is now done in data which tends to make it somebody an example of this type of rails it takes a lot of the boilerplate of web development and factors it out of the code and into libraries driven by data and simplistic code blurs the line between code and data files actually loop back to being specified in ruby	
	
real even if it is really hard to grasp if you have not used is that you loose the language has concepts that you cannot possibly express in and they have they are part of the but lost in the translation to is not an but rather an that you have a container that is sorted on a field of the elements that are those objects are really you need to offer access to the data for readers showing the information in the in you can go in one of two either you make a copy for the caller to use that the data will not but or you return a reference to your internally held object hoping the caller will not change your data through the user gets the reference and changes through it the field that serves as then your container invariants are you can return a constant and the compiler will disable calling setter methods on the instance you you get both the security that the user will not change and efficiency in the third not mentioned before option is making the object but that disables changes perfectly controlled changes to the object will be and the only possibility of change is creating a new element with the changes that amounts to time and

real value in hungarian notation dates back to c programming and the weakly typed nature of back in the day the easiest way to keep track of the type was to use languages like the type system tells you all you need to and the ide presents this to you in a very user friendly way so there is simply no need to use for good reason to not use well there are quite a in and for that matter and many other langause you often create your own so what would be the hungarian for a even if you can decide on sensible hungarian notations it still makes the actual variable name slightly harder to read because you have to skip past the at the more important is the maintainance cost what if you start of with a list and change to another type of collection i seem to do a lot at the you then need to rename all your variables that use that all for no real if you had just used a decent name to begin with you have to worry about your what if you created or used some more meaningful type for holding a path you then need to change your to which is a pain and in this case not actually very

really depends on what you are trying to do with the rest of the response is correct if you only need to perform an action for each distinct element in the if just sets up some state based on the fact that list element has changed and you are operating on each element in the list need the individual elements for another then your method seems perfectly

really like the ability to overload arithmetic operators for types in but only for types with for example fixed point 3d vector complex number arbitrary length written similar code in java and been annoyed by having to write things like instead of mind a mathematician by seems to me operator overloading lets you get a little bit of goodness in without having to actually implement it really annoys me when i see being overloaded with functionality which would better be done by the dodgy but well established iostream or stl for post discovering i imagine life without and smart pointers be nearly as convenient without overloaded

really pretty the only changes i have in my vimrc for windows are i recall correctly this makes a few small like changing to since is used as paste on there are a few other like using set guioptions to change the behavior of the menu i use these commands in windows to turn off all the menu but you can customize it how you can check behave and guioptions for more info from within	
	
really say this is an issue as long as they can easily look up the change log to see whats thinking if no libraries have been updated in any of the nor have there been any changes to the product itself the version number should stay the only suggestion i could make is moving to a dated version number so that the major and minor versions change so something like would be the 17th of april 2009 release with the build number of yyyy and xxxx as the svn if you want to change the major number and want to keep the date in the minor you could use versioning a good blog article on how microsoft do their versioning at

really specific to win32 the question when should two different error cases be identified by two different and when should they throw the same type with different values stored inside this is impossible to answer without knowing in advance all the situations your code will be called this is the problem with only being able to filter exceptions by broadly if you have a strong feeling that it would be useful to treat two error cases throw different it is frequently the case that the string returned by just needs to be logged or displayed to the there is additional wrap the win32exception with something more of your for trying to do something to a and the user running under have permission to do catch the wrap it in an exception class of your whose message gives the filename and the operation being followed by the inner

reason behind this is that the datagrid supports ui virtualization and the listbox does this means that the datagrid only creates visual elements for the visible items while the listbox creates visual elements for all of its you have to select from a list of items that can be very use the datagrid instead of the you can style the datagrid and use the templatecolumn to make it look just like a	
	
reason not to have primary key defined as identity is having primary key defined as guids or populated with externally generated every table that is semantically meaningful by itself should have primary key and such key should have no semantic a join table that realizes relationship is not meaningful by itself and so it need such primary key already has one via its	
	
reason that the code work is because the n variable is not evaluated during the are creating an anonymous function in the loop that you pass to the so the code in the anonymous function executed until the mouse wheel even by then the value of the n variable is or perhaps something completely different if you are using the variable anywhere else in the you instead use the function to create the function from a you can inject the current value of the n variable into the if prevent should it be should the mousewheel event for the element call

reason why it is not safe to instanciate a vector of is that there is an algorithm that will do a copy of one object in your container on the implements quicksort which needs a therefore deleting it when going out of scpope of the well any or function of your own that are able to take your container as and copy one of its object on the stack will cause this issue as a in your it is simple you must ensure your class does not behaves as an or ensure you will never call such that can delete your underlying the first solution is according to me your copy constructor and your affectation operator as should not give away property of the pointer best way to achieve that is to wrapp a boost smart pointer instead of an to make your container safe when calling such the way according to defining a better copy operator to bypass this issue is not a good i see a good copy constructor implementation affectation operator as that could keep safe the result of applying the

recursive from postgresql	
	
recursive function is like a spring you compress a bit on each on each you put a bit of information on a when the final step is the spring is collecting all values at sure this metaphor is beyond the classical examples which is the worst example since it is inefficient and easily which are a bit artificial if use them in real programming it is interesting to see where it is really very common case is to walk a tree a but trees are more in a folder to list the you iterate on if you find a the function listing the files call itself with the new folder as when coming back from listing this new folder its it resumes its to the next file concrete case is when drawing a hierarchy of gui it is common to have like to hold components which can be panes or compound the painting routine calls recursively the paint function of each which calls the paint function of all the components it sure if i am very but i like to show real world use of teaching as it was something i was stumbling upon in the

refer you to michael rules of program do experts do it maintainable code is far more important than optimizing for a speed problem that you think you have would start build a candidate name then loop through the existing filters to see if that name if it increment and try this is but until you get thousands of that will be good sometime the does become a then start by building a hashset of existing then you can check each candidate name against the rather than rebuild the hashset each time you need a unique then throw it you need the complexity of maintaining it in the face of this would leave your code easy to while only being will be good you do not need the user is not going to click enough times for there to be any

regex match the completely empty but not a string consisting of a single because your regex states that if the string is not it needs to contain at least one double this is because of the tokens inside the regex which are not followed by proper way to think about the needed regular expression is as you want to match without double followed by plus without double followed by quote followed by without double and then repeat starting from the first ad string without double quotes is so you get added for you compare this with your regular the first has been moved of the

requires random access so your only options to use that are vector or it will swap the and at a guess vector will probably perform slightly faster than deque because it typically has a simpler underlying data the difference is likely very marginal you use a there is a specialisation which should swap the pointers rather than the however because not random access use mergesort instead of which will probably mean that the algorithm itself is a little i think the answer is normally if you have large classes for each element so copying overhead dominates the sorting list might beat or alternatively you could store pointers to them in a vector and supply a custom predicate to sort them

say what kind of data it is much depends on your and this data is very large many instances of the objects in a database can help performance via its indexing otherwise it probably hurts or is your app is being run by multiple users and they may want to write this a database helps because you can rely on transactions to ensure data with persistence you have to handle that if the data is or a database is very likely your app has its own using a database places an additional burden on the who must set up and maintain patches the database if the database can be guaranteed to be available and is handled by someone this is less of an are the security requirements for the if the data is with multiple users simultaneous or you may need to manage security and permissions on the without seeing the data hard to say whether it would be easier to manage with persistence or a the data is many of the above questions about the data have answers pointing toward if you need centralized the answers generally point toward a guess is that you probably need a based solely on the fact that asking about it mainly from a perspective and not a especially in is highly customizable and can be easily tailored to persist only the essential pieces you there are best for versioning this data as so not sure an advantage on the database side from that if you do not know that functionality will be required in the do not build for it almost certainly easier overall to solve that problem when the time comes than to constrain your development more often than sharing data between parts of the that should be architected into the application into the classes that access the overload the persistence mechanism to also be a data conduit between parts of the if you overload it that turning the persisted state into a contract instead of properly treating it as an extension of the private state of the

seem to have two forms of equivalence to deal plain equivalence tracked as equivalence classes which are kept up to date and structural equivalence for which you occasionally go build a single equivalence class and then throw it sounds to me like the problem would be conceptually simpler if you maintain equivalence classes for both plain and structural if that introduces too much churn for the structural you could maintain equivalence classes for some aspects of structural then you could find a balance where you can afford the maintenance of those equivalence classes but still greatly reduce the number of nodes to examine when building a list of structurally equivalent

short answer would be anything that you go behind the back the to obtain can be termed as memory if you up a chunk of memory in a managed class then cantstaymanaged is responsible for freeing this memory to synchronization as a thumb rule if you call winapis to obtain to a then those are now cantstaymanaged has 2 things it needs to cleanup before it bids member fields and any resources the clr this usually equates to calling dispose on your member all the sneaky stuff we pull behind its are 2 ways the object cleanup can be triggered you called dispose explicitly on your good you forgot to call in which case the finalizer should kick in and still ensure proper both the unmanaged resources should be freed up else you should only attempt to cleanup managed resources only in former the case the clr might have already finalized and collected some of your so you access them guarantee an order in which an object graph is hence you avoid issues by guarding your managed cleanup with an guard	
	
short answer you want the usernames to be you need to store them in the database in a convert the given username to all all use wherever you use in the code you long answer need to check for the of a key in a assuming you have a primary key attribute on the username simply try to your data into the table converting it to if the database returns a you know the username already existed and you can display the error if the database returns that it successfully inserted the row by using the this saves you from having to do a select before doing the greatly simplifying your should also escape all the strings that be inserting into the table to help avert potential security escape into userdb display error elseif insert else affected rows is something went

simplest approach that i can think is to add some logic into your data access layer that will inject a domain object with its dependencies before returning it to a higher layer called the service you could annotate each properties to indicate what needs to get wired if not on java you could implement an interface for each component that needs to be or even declare this all in xml and feed that data to the context that will do the if you wanted to get you could pull this out into an aspect and apply it globally across your data access layer so all methods that pull out domain objects will wire up them up just after they are

simplest way to answer your question might be to turn your question upside that the cryptoserviceprovider implementation holds all the it is just as fast and uses just as little memory as why do both implementations do we even in the at what we know about each one generates cryptographically secure random the other makes no is generating random numbers that are sufficiently random to be used in or generating numbers that simply but guarantee anything there a cost associated with generating cryptographically secure random then random number generator would do can usually assume that standard library functions are designed to do what it says on the box and do it is designed to get you the next random number in a sequence of numbers efficiently as is designed to generate random numbers strong enough to be used in and do as efficiently as if there was a way to do this as efficiently as then would use it question seems to assume brain damage on the part of the framework designers that they somehow designed a needlessly slow function to generate cryptographically secure random even though there was a faster fastest way to generate cryptographically secure random numbers is most likely to call the function designed by experts to generate cryptographically secure random

simplest way to represent sound as numbers is pcm code this means that the amplitude of the sound is recorded at a set frequency amplitude value is called a cd quality sound for example is 16 bit samples at the frequency 44100 sample can be represented as an integer number 24 or 32 or a floating point number bit float or 32 bit the number can either be signed or 16 bit signed samples the value 0 would be in the and and 32767 would be the maximum for 16 bit unsigned samples the value 32768 would be in the and 0 and 65535 would be the maximum floating point samples the usual format is that 0 is in the and and are the maximum pcm data can then be for example using

simply a matter of doing the given a certain amount of traffic for a set of you can calculate exactly how much hosting those file on s3 would cost and you should be able to do the same for your current if the number is lower for there you have your added benefit is that s3 scales pretty much linearly with traffic and you pay only for what you actually whereas most providers charge you a flat fee no matter how little traffic you actially and some will gouge you badly if you ever exceed the maximum traffic included in the flat speed and availability could be an additional if you have a site that could potentially incur wildly disparate then using s3 for its images and other static files means that if hit by the slashdot the site has a much better chance of staying and you have a much better chance of avoiding nasty surprises concerning excess traffic

situation is a result of msbuild not supporting setup so we are forced to use devenv to build the solution with cruise real problem was that projects in the same solution were referenced by the main application and while this was not reproducible in full setup projects it did happened repeatedly in cf setup this issue by changing the architecture of our cf solutions to have all related projects in 1 project as folders so there is only 1 exe produced and packaged with the setup notable that we had missing assemblies when referencing other dll files but only when we were referencing library projects which existed in the same googling about this subject i found out some disturbing details about this which point me to the fact that this bug and the incapability of msbuild to support setup project exist since in msdn forum reports and not

so familiar with iis7 but i can help you on some vs active ftp when it means that the server contacts the the client chooses a port that will be used to transfer data and then sends it back to the server to passive is used when people are behind a firewall for example and it means that the client choose a port but rather the server does that and the clients connect to if client allow for the server to initialize the connection then passive mode is more information matter if the connection is passive or the security is the why does it timeout is a bit there may be several timeout one for active and one for passive there may also be other set of rules that override the ones you are using	
	
so here is a problem analogous to my problem elaborate on the real problem but i think this analogy will be easier to have a strange coin that only comes up heads 1 in every tosses remainder being in other for every tails i there will be 1 have a peculiar disease where i only notice 1 in every tails i but i notice every and so it appears to me that the rate of noticing a heads or tails is of aware of this disease and its effect so i can compensate for now gives me a new and i noticed that the rate of noticing heads is now given that my disease changed still only notice 1 in every how do i calculate the actual ratio of heads to tails that this new coin need to understand this to help with this so if it confuses you ignore it so what is the real i have a bunch of data consisting of and outputs which are 1s and i want to teach a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict the expected output float between 0 and given an the problem is that the 1s are very and this screws up the internal math because it becomes very susceptible to rounding errors even with floating point i normalize the data by randomly omitting most of the 0 training samples so that it appears that there is a roughly equal ratio of 1s and of this means that now the machine learning output is predicting a instead of predicting as it it would now predict need a way to convert the output of the machine learning algorithm back to a probability within the original training a known bias in collected

so in php will lead to the loading parsing of and execution of more php if you do go this get to the right page with external remember that php scripts are essentially compiled every time hit caching will be much more efficient at doing it will also force you to keep such rules fairly simple since can only use regular expressions a few other whereas in php you could potentially do anything doing database lookups to find the right not expressions usually just a case of my rewrite rules look like pretty basic	
	
so maybe it is insane to disable the power but we have a software application the uses a database and uses an expensive set of this large german vendor uses a license manager that moves the licenses physically around the certain and cutting the power corrupts the we have a ups to allow elegant shutdowns if the machine power is now it seems some service guy or operator has powered down the pc with the power button corrupting the these devices are located in remote location all over the world and training the operator may not always prevent it seems like the solution options are work with the vendor to disable the power attempt to trap it and warn the user of possible or redesign the display using an os and application immune from this power	
	
so read and understood the following truths concerning web is for is for is for is normally all fine and and i find that when i strictly follow these guidelines and use external and it makes my entire site much much more i think i found a situation that breaks this line of have a custom forums system that built for one of my in addition to the usual formatting for such a system bold italics and allowed my users to set the formatting of their including font and all of this is saved in by database of forum messages as formatting and then translated to the corresponding html when the page is bit technically i should translate before but this way i can work on the system to the nature of this and other similar i end up with a lot of tags floating around the resulting html which i believe are unofficially deprecated since supposed to be using css for this breaks rules one and which state that html should not contain formatting preferring that information to be located in the css document there a way to achieve dynamic formatting in css without including that information in the is it worth the considering the implied limitations of proper an i to what my users can in order to follow the way to format my does the traditional is only for line of thought handle dynamic

software design and the stability of the environment both contribute heavily to how deployable software each application should be configurable and make it a habit for applicaitons to have a startup script that validates its environment and produces meaningful error control access to the servers and insist that teams modifying those servers have done due testing in a stable test be a champion of the test the changes the applications teams make should be scripted when possible and include an implementation a validation a backout and a backout validation provide a place where temp files and artifacts get automatically get cleaned gets cleaned each and every gets cleaned each five gets cleaned every thirty consier statically linking shared code if many applications share the same avoid rats nests of avoid shared champion logging isolate your test systems from your production create standards to not write outside of the current directory or a fixed set of create a clear linkage between the binary deployed and the source management system it came monitor your servers for runaway filling and network be draconian about permission figure out a way to reward system

solution does not support a core business but a such as facilities where you are no different from your competitors processes will your internal development skills would be better used to create and maintain solutions that give your company a competitive former applies in spades if the solution does not need to be heavily integrated with your existing or future solutions supports a relatively isolated need to budget and staff for maintenance throughout the lifecycle of an developed the numbers but one figure seen and find quite believable is that the initial development costs of a custom application accounts for only the total lifecycle that includes stuff like upgrades and integration which also hits an externally procured but a 10x factor on the initial price tag will make most management take special case of the for maintenance and operations may be lacking or a bottleneck in your every skill shortage can be filled with enough time and but not necessarily within acceptable every additional technology skill your staff needs to acquire means less time to develop and maintain existing the skills cost of a diverse technical landscape grows at a more than linear peter but high costs can trump the risks of starting a development in a business where cost overrun is often considered a successful whereas unsuccessful projects have basically no vatine also commercial software can be had delayed only by installation and end user installation of something like sap done in a applies if your vendor is reasonably if they are small or have weak commercial software can be a much greater gamble than way you you get never free and seldom cheap to migrate away from an application that actually finds

solution is probably best when working with arrays you have to filter out empty but if you use the array when dealing with query results returned from one solution is just a simple if while if else while build a list and filter out empty i would write a custom as per jon foreach as if else if return else return you can call it like else

solution is wrong because the methods are your even but if you add delimiters and set multiline it will work modifier allows to match the beginning of a logical line rather than just the beginning of the whole the anchor is necessary because without it the regex would match the newline at the end of every not just the blank you need the anchor because actively matching the newline but it gets the job but more complicated than it needs to the regex has to match either the beginning of the string multiline mode not or at least one newline followed by at least one newline in the special case of a string that starts with one or blank be replaced with blank pretty sure not the desired what it does most of the time is replace two or more consecutive along with any horizontal whitespace or that lies between with one the the author seems to expect to match just the space character when in fact it matches any whitespace a very common the actual list varies from one regex flavor to the but at minimum you can expect to match whatever in php you have a better matches any horizontal whitespace and matches vertical live demos and the site keeps changing back to so select the tab at the top to see it

some dissent since this got bumped so some relevant bits from the research shows that the standard really define forward nor does it explicitly state that enums can or be forward from section underlying type of an is an integral type that can all the enumerator values defined the it which type is used as the underlying for an enumeration except that underlying type shall not be than int unless the value of enumerator cannot fit in an int unsigned if the is the underlying type is as the enumeration had a enumerator with value the value applied to an an object of enumeration or an is the value applied to the the underlying type of an enum is with one minor we flip to the section on which is about as close as we come to any standard on forward class that has been declared but not or an array of unknown size or of incomplete element is an object class type as might be incomplete at one point in a translation unit and complete later the type is the same type at both the declared type of an array object might be an array of incomplete class type and therefore if the class type is completed later on in the translation the array type becomes the array type at those two points is the same the declared type of an array object might be an array of unknown size and therefore be incomplete at one point in a translation unit and complete later the array types at those two points of unknown bound of and of n are different the type of a pointer to array of unknown or of a type defined by a typedef declaration to be an array of unknown cannot be the standard pretty much laid out the types that can be forward enum so compiler authors generally regard forward declaring as disallowed by the standard due to the variable size of its underlying makes enums are usually referenced in and the compiler would indeed need to know the storage size in those since the storage size is implementation many compilers may just choose to use 32 bit values for the underlying type of every at which point it becomes possible to forward declare an interesting experiment might be to try forward declaring an enum in visual then forcing it to use an underlying type greater than as explained above to see what	
	
some experimentation around question matching a string as i ran across another weird matching consider the following code that treats a string as a sequence of string val uha uha match case case case input on the empty string correctly yields if i rewrite the first match clause as matching of fails and matches the default clause through the scala library source code you have to do in an ideal world i believe that both and will result in this does not concur with the phenomenon described above because only matches the empty upon some further experimentation this question can be narrowed down to the list emptyseq boolean basically means that an empty does not automatically equal when matching against a constant opposed to using an extractor as suggested by this unequality leads to the failing same is true when interpreting the empty as a does the empty string not match as

someone can comment on hashing it helps if they have at least a fundamental understanding of the underlying concepts and all of the responses so far which have focused on endless typecasting are completely but even will result in unreliable results if a unicode string is being first thing you need to understand is that hashing and encryption algorithms operate at the that means they care what hashing or you can hash plain full etc the algorithm working with the only thing you have to ensure is that the internal function of your hashing library returns an ansistring in the function which spits out your resulting all that actual code for your project can be based on normal string which maps to unicodestring in delphi you be typecasting anything to ansistring or by doing you immediately create a broken hash if and when the user tries to hash anything outside the scope of the ansi character and in the world of a broken hash is both unreliable and

sql from occasionally results in a server is not under much load so the approach used is to lock as much as lock to prevent when multiple instances of an application calls this begin transaction check that no one has inserted the rows in t1 before and that t2 is in a valid state if not exists top 1 1 from t1 where fkid in and not top 1 1 from t2 where dbid in and test1 is not im the first go insert the row in t1 and update t2 finally write a log to t3 insert into select from t2 where dbid in update t2 set lastchangedby lastchangedat where dbid in insert into t3 select from t2 where dbid in select status on the rows so the program can evaluate what just select status from t1 where fkid in commit believe the problem is that multiple tables needs to be a bit unsure when the tables are actually xlocked when a table is used the first time or are all tables locked at one time at begin transaction when are table actually

strictly do this a single in a general because different platforms use different executable the jvm thing is relying on having a jvm already installed on the destination if there is one then your jar run unless you install a jvm in a perhaps more any python packages that rely on binary extensions will not play well with jython unless specifically released in a jython which is presume that a similar situation holds for ruby though i have no direct knowledge nor even how common it is for ruby packages to use binary be able to use the whole range of java but very little in the way of also worth noting that the jvm versions of languages tend to lag behind the standard offering fewer language features and your code is pure then already as long as the destination machine already has python just as java but at least in rather less safe to assume that python is installed than to assume that java is the elements are likely to be user expectations about a reasonable installation process vary considerably across too if your app uses libraries or better include all of them for windows but users tend to be more tolerant of downloading expectations for that to be handled automatically by a package manager are if this is a application stack and you want to be able to have a bundle that can be deployed on almost any the easiest route would probably be to distribute it as a complete vmware virtual machine the player software is free at least windows and but i presume for mac as and it allows you to create a dedicated system already fully configured specifically for your say because then you need to worry about os licensing a smaller application that you want to allow to run on a existing then i suspect that compatibility will be less of a concern than compatibility while apache have a windows the vast majority of windows webservers run and having a single package distribution even single version of your that plays well with both of those webservers is likely to be

suggest two methods of doing overlapped and ignore the third misunderstanding your you issue an overlapped a for you can specify an overlapped structure which contains an event and you can wait for that event to be signalled to indicate the overlapped has i is your approach as previously this scale well as limited to the number of handles that you can pass to you can pass a completion routine which is called when completion this is known as and requires that the thread that issued the call is in an state for the completion routine to be threads can put themselves in an alertable state in several ways or the various ex versions of the wait the that i have open in front of me says have worked with alertable quite a and be the first to tell you that alertable is horrible and should be enough said a third before issuing the call you should associate the handle that you want to do overlapped on with a completion you then create a pool of threads which service this completion port by calling and you issue your with an overlapped structure without an event in it and when the completes the completion pops out of on one of your pool threads and can be handled previously 2008 have cleaned up how iocps work a little and removed the problem whereby you had to make sure that the thread that issued the overlapped request continued to run until the request link to a reference to that can be found but this problem is easy to work around you simply marshal the wsarecv over to one of your pool threads using the same iocp that you use for imho using iocps is the best way to do overlapped getting your head around the nature of the calls can take a little time at the start but well worth it as the system scales very well and offers a simple and method of dealing with overlapped you need some sample code to get you going then i have several articles on writing io completion port systems and a heap of free code that provides a framework for high performance see an you really should read via by jeffrey richter and christophe nasarre as it deals will all you need to know about overlapped and most other advanced windows platform techniques and

summary lists both c and which of them are you looking c and are two distinct and differ greatly in their string handling and data structures the fact that the c ones work in change do you want a perfect hash is it that you want to associate a string with a and thought that would be a good way to do is this some sort of homework do you have a reason not to use in if you do need a perfect what are the constraints on the will there be a certain fixed set you want to dispatch what about strings that match one of the are you willing to accept hits from random or is the number of incoming strings you could edit your question to include information like we could be a lot more response to the first two we should look at c since you presumably want this for both your c and you presumably want the but have you if dealing with strings coming in on the the time there is likely to dwarf the dispatch are expecting arbitrary a bit much to expect a perfect hash function that will avoid all collisions from random so you do need to consider you considered a it may be more efficient than a perfect hash function may not it should be fairly easy to implement in and it will avoid problems with redoing your list of dispatching strings or possible

supporting code is but you want not to be distracted by it when you want there are two technologies that can with will help you modularize your code so that and so on can be implemented once and then combined with many other it will also help you write unit some good ways to learn the techniques are to read the paper functional programming and to learn about the i am not a shill for john but he does do wonderful you cannot use a programming language with powerful capabilities for modularization and or if you want don technique will help you organize your code so that you can split up parts the way you want and pay attention only to what you when you the tool supports any language that can be written in and also combinations of those

suspect that this will end up being a database design issue more than a query optimization the steps to analyze this query have all been outlined to consider the logic of your you may not need to run this query nearly as many times as you are or you may find that you need the data in the same format that currently producing allowing you to write a simpler and faster going to assume that you need this query generate the execution plan for the query for a sample the include execution plan button or for portions of the the execution plan that are taking a lot of and see if you can tie those back to a specific part of the this will give us the clues on where to focus our around with these portions of the query and see what you can come up thing that i can see that might help performance on the specifics of your is to try and force the order of data access to the dettaglioorarilinee for dettaglioorarilineeperiodi select idorario from where idorario in select idorario is still an inner from periodi where 0 as as and as as select as as as as over by order by as select from dettaglioorarilineeperiodi where idrellineestazionamenti as inner select idorario from dettaglioorarilineeperiodi where idrellineestazionamenti as on inner join on select idorario from where 0 or idgiorno on or as as and as as and or not in as as idorario from as as as as as 0 or idgiorno as row thing you could try would be replacing the or not in as as idorario from as or not like and not like and not like if you find anything that or you have a bunch of the next step would be to see if you can modify the indexes for these what recommend is loading sql profiler may need to install it from your sql and creating a new as soon as the trace has execute the operation that is taking too and then stop the save the trace to a and then launch the database engine tuning load the and select the database to and press this will give you a list of focus on changes to the dettaglioorarilinee and any other table that took up a large part of the execution plan with a scan strongly advise not implementing the recommended changes straight from this instead use these recommndations as a if none of the above give you the needed performance you could look into denormalizing the table dettaglioorarilinee so that each row has the data for the a and b this is probably not a good

tends to confuse most profilers in that they sure how to count time that one thread is blocked waiting on another and time a thread is waiting around for work you using the thread are two profilers that you should check out in our has a free profiler that does code injection for it only works down to the method but does work on 64 bit and can give you a sense of where your time is the ant profiler is the best used for drilling into line level timings which is critical if you have a scenario where threads are blocked waiting on each other for a significant part of their execution if you can run your tests without a user interface i highly recommend setting up some nunit performance tests so you can quickly and easily repeat them exactly the same way each doing this you can see where your time is going even with a method level propose and check individual be surprised how taking time from one place just adds it to another because the threads end up waiting on each so having a perfectly repeatable test is very eqatech profiler modifies your compiled il so whenever you that il you get a new performance tracing so it should fit your command line i believe ant can work if your application is going to be used in multiple environments definitely recommend running a few performance test runs on a single processor or hyperthread only when you get very aggressive about tuning for multicores you can end up adding enough overhead that you may deadlock or just be slow on small numbers of

tests localize failures more tests more closely correspond to user requirements and so are better predictor of delivery neither of them is much good unless built and but both of them are very valuable if properly thing with units tests is that no integration level test can exercise all the code as much as a good set of unit tests that can mean that you have to refactor the tests but in general your tests depend on the internals so lets say for example that you have a single function to get a power of you describe it a formal methods claim you specify returns for 0 p test and your spec look essentially the same is sort of for your implementation can be a for loop with a and you can come along later and change that to a you change the implementation so returning 16 bits that is only guaranteed to be no less than then this tests will fail an test should probably but not and just as likely as not to fail somewhere far downstream of the computation of point is that they really test for diferent if you could build sufficiently details and extensive integration you might be able to get the same level of coverage and degree of but probably hard to do at and the exponential explosion will defeat by partitioning the state space using unit the number of tests you need grows much less than

that every regex in perl 6 is required to be able to distinguish its patterns from its and return its list of initial token patterns including the token patterns of any subrule called by the part of that but not including any subrule more than since that would involve self which is not allowed in traditional regular a logical alternation using then takes two or more of these lists and dispatches to the alternative that matches the longest token this may or may not be the alternative that comes first if two alternatives match at the same the tie is broken first by the alternative that starts with the longest fixed string that an exact match counts as closer than a match made using character if that the tie broken by one of two if the alternatives are in different standard mro resolution determines which one to try if the alternatives are in the same grammar the textually earlier alternative takes a rules are defined in more than one the order is and an explicit assertion must be used to force failure if the wrong one is tried seems to be a very different promise from the one made in perl

the answer below is only valid for java ee as was brought to my attention in one of the other java ee 6 does support so if using java ee read this but read the other relevant my own research and from the responses to this question the answer i found is the although jaas is a standard there is no uniform way to deploy and integrate a jaas realm loginmodule in various application v2 requires you to extend some of its own internal classes that implement loginmodule or realm you can however not customize the whole login process because many methods of the loginmodule interface are marked final in the custom loginmodule and realm classes must be placed in the as classpath the and the realm must be manually registered deployment from the situation seems to be a bit better for which will let you code your own realm and loginmodule and then configure them into the application server using its own jaasrealm will delegate the actual work to your implementations of realm and even tomcat allow deploying your custom realm from your that none of the application servers that showed up my results seem to be able to take full advantage of all the jaas all of them seem to only support the basic if you need anything more complicated than then you will need to find a solution that is not managed by your java ee and because it was asked for in the comments to my here is the code i wrote for of the realm class webservicerealm extends appservrealm static final logger log string string int string void throws nosuchrealmexception webservice realm read the configuration properties from the use reasonable default values if not string configport port configport using default port string return enumeration throws nosuchuserexception list groupnames new return string return webservice string return int return string return then the loginmodule class webserviceloginmodule extends appservpasswordloginmodule all variables starting with are supplied by the and must be in void throws loginexception if null throw new and password cannot be groups must be called as last operation of the login boolean throws loginexception if return fetch some more information through the return webserviceclient return in the realm has to be tied to the this is done at the jaas configuration file which in glassfish v2 lies at add the following lines at the end of that use whatever string is returned from you is what got things working for me on this solution is not portable across application but as far as i can there is no existing portable	
	
the answer to has most of the information you need to put together your might also want to see the chapter on sorting in has a completely fine although i hate using like a more familiar way to do the same thing is to go through the keys of the hash but sort by the sort keys do it this way because a little less do i sort a hash by value instead of by brian d sort a start with the in this we give the list of keys to the sort function which then compares them asciibetically might be affected by your locale the output list has the keys in asciibetical once we have the we can go through them to create a report which lists the keys in asciibetical sort cmp keys my printf could get more fancy in the block instead of comparing the we can compute a value with them and use that value as the to make our report order we use the sequence in a string to make everything the block then compares the lowercased values to determine in which order to put the sort cmp keys if the computation is expensive or the hash has many you may want to look at the schwartzian transform to cache the computation we want to sort by the hash value we use the hash key to look it we still get out a list of but this time they are ordered by their sort keys there we can get more if the hash values are the we can provide a secondary sort on the hash sort cmp keys	
	
the answer to your question is probably there are lots of reasons to avoid throwing exceptions whenever but memory really a real reason to only throw exceptions for truly exceptional conditions is that generating an exception involves carefully examining the not a fast operation at if doing it as part of your regularly flow of it will noticeably affect your i once wrote a logging system that i thought was extremely clever because it automatically figured out which class had invoked it by generating an exception and examining the stack in that eventually i had to go back and take that part out because it was noticeably slowing everything else

the best of my there are no preprocessor directives for detecting strict you are using then the compiler will warn you about code that may break the strict aliasing this option is only active when it warns about code might break the strict aliasing that the compiler is using the warning does catch all but does attempt catch the more common it included in it is to the code you are working on is critical then you can disable in or if you want to disable strict i suggest looking at the asm output to make sure the compiler doing dangerous optimizations that you an akauppi said in the enables strict optimizations for particular restrict keyword does not directly but rather it gives the compiler more information and that extra information indirectly helps the compiler determine if it can apply specific optimization good explanation of the restrict keyword from dsp compiler help the compiler determine memory you can qualify or array with the restrict the restrict keyword type qualifier that may be applied to and its a guarantee by the programmer that within the scope of the the object pointed to can be accessed only by that of this guarantee renders the program this practice compiler optimize certain sections of code because aliasing be more easily

the can store js code in a bookmark so in can be used in any web site you called and a hell of a fun for web to enhance you are like most of the web you want ie6 to but there is a way to make him interpret the css just like which is much conditional comments to load a js librairy that will tweak his behavior lt ie you can deal more easily with and not care about the ie6 users will have to wait some seconds for js to load the first and for those who have ie6 and js they will see a crappy website but they are masochist anyway over arrays using think everybody know the usefullness of the loop creating an object short to use it like a diner looping over its in diner there is since you can use an object like an associative you can process keys and like a foreach loop looping over its properties and in diner since array are objects you can iterate other array the exact same way in easily an known element from an arr pos 1 use the second argument converts a string to but will try to guess the numeral system if you omit following the rules the string begins with the radix is 16 the string begins with the radix is 8 this feature is the string begins with any other the radix is 10 of the you will use the property ownership while using iterate other the object but the properties can be ineritated from the object since anyone can dynamically alter on sensible objects better check if the property is its own before using it for name in if

the definitive i wrote about the differences between maven and ant in the introduction the section title is differences between ant and an answer that is a combination of the info in that introduction with some additional simple only showing you this to illustrate the idea at the most basic maven has a simple ant build simple example build set global properties for this build create the time stamp create the build directory structure used by compile the source compile the java code from into the create the distribution directory put everything in into the delete the and directory trees this simple ant you can see how you have to tell ant exactly what to there is a compile goal which includes the javac task that compiles the source in the directory to the you have to tell ant exactly where your source where you want the resulting bytecode to be and how to package this all into a jar while there are some recent developments that help make ant less a experience with ant is in coding a procedural language written in the previous ant example with a maven in to create a jar file from some java all you need to do is create a simple place your source code in and then run mvn install from the command the example maven that achieves the same all you need in your running mvn install from the command line will process compile execute unit create a and install the jar in a local repository for reuse in other without you can run mvn site and then find an file in that contains links to javadoc and a few reports about your source this is the simplest possible example a project which only contains source code and which produces a a project which follows maven conventions and require any dependencies or if we wanted to start customizing the our is going to grow in and in the largest of projects you can see collections of very complex maven poms which contain a great deal of plugin customization and dependency even when your pom files become more they hold an entirely different kind of information from the build file of a similarly sized project using maven poms contain is a jar and source code is in ant build files contain explicit is source is in javac against this the results in a jar from the where ant had to be explicit about the there was something to maven that just knew where the source code was and how it should be differences between ant and maven in this have formal conventions like a common project directory you have to tell ant exactly where to find the source and where to put the informal conventions have emerged over but they been codified into the is you have to tell ant exactly what to do and when to do you had to tell it to then then have a you had to define goals and goal you had to attach a sequence of tasks to each goal has it already knew where your source code was because you followed the it put the bytecode in and it produced a jar file in is all you had to do was create a file and put your source in the default maven took care of the has a which you invoked when you executed mvn this command told maven to execute a series of sequence steps until it reached the as a of this journey through the maven executed a number of default plugin goals which did things like compile and create a about so someone like steve loughran is going to read that comparison and call going to talk about how the answer completely ignores something called ivy and the fact that ant can reuse build logic in the more recent releases of this is if you have a bunch of smart people using ant antlibs end up with a well designed build that even very much convinced that maven makes happily use ant ivy with a project team that had a very sharp build that being i do think end up missing out on a number of valuable plugins such as the jetty plugin and that end up doing a whole bunch of work that you need to do over important than maven that you use a repository manager to keep track of software suggest you can use nexus to proxy remote repositories and to provide a place for your team to deploy internal have appropriate modularization of software one big monolithic component rarely scales over as your project want to have the concept of modules and maven lends itself to this approach very adopt some conventions for your even if you use you should strive to adopt some form of convention that is consistent with other when a project uses it means that anyone familiar with maven can pick up the build and start running with it without having to fiddle with configuration just to figure out how to get the thing to

the easiest solution is to only really working on one project at a if you work on multiple you could have another alias which changed the directories within those aliases use something game17 this is a useful thing to i decided to put together a series of scripts that can be all based aroung a configuration file that you place in your home along with aliases to source the file is of the lists all the relevant projects and sodoku in this and their directories may be different for each but have src and data in this first action is to initialize so the end of your and create the file sets up the four aliases to source the files which include usage list all directories in current list all show current set current project to show current and since they can get out of sync if you mix cd and set actual real directory to expected directory other get them back into set directory to actual script which just lists the allowed directories in the current project are broken into multiple lines for readability but they should all be on one directories grep sed sort sed shows all the possible projects grep sed sort sed the meaty sets shows the current grep if 0 echo project name export project is the same for directories within the grep if 0 echo directory name for project export cd sed head sed sed head sed project directory directory uses three environment variables which are reserved for its own and other than those and the files and there are no other resources the yet most adaptable solution i could come up best of

the gcc toolchain to give you an image suitable for use directly on the hardware without an os to load it is but involves a couple of steps that normally needed for normal will almost certainly need to customize the c run time startup this is an assembly module named something like that is responsible initializing the initialized clearing the calling constructors for global objects if modules with global objects are typical customizations include the need to setup your hardware to actually address the ram including setting up the dram controller as so that there is a place to put data and some cpus need to have these things done in a specific the coldfire mcf5307 has one chip select that responds to every address after boot which eventually must be configured to cover just the area of the memory map planned for the attached hardware team you with another hat should have a memory map documenting what is at various rom at ram at device registers at in some the hardware team might only have connected a chip select from the cpu to a and leave it up to you to decide what address triggers that select ld supports a very flexible linker script language that allows the various sections of the executable image to be placed in specific address for normal you never see the linker script since a stock one is supplied by gcc that is tuned to your assumptions for a normal output of the linker is in a relocatable format that is intended to be loaded into ram by an it probably has relocation fixups that need to be and may even dynamically load some in a rom dynamic loading is not so you be doing but you still need a raw binary image in a hex format suitable for a prom programmer of some so you will need to use the objcopy utility from binutil to transform the linker output to a suitable to answer the actual question you use a linker script to specify the target addresses of each section of your in that you have several options for dealing with device but all of them involve putting the bss and heap segments in address ranges that avoid the hardware there are also mechanisms available that can make sure that ld throws an error if you overfill your rom or and you should use those as getting the device addresses into your c code can be done with as in your or by declaring a symbol directly in the linker script that is resolved to the base address of the with a matching declaration in a c header it is possible to use attribute to define an instance of an uninitialized as being located in a specific section as i have found that not to work well in real it can create maintenance and it becomes an expensive way to describe the full register map of the if you use that the linker script would then be responsible for mapping to its correct any you are going to need to get a good understanding of object file concepts such as the and bss sections at and may need to chase down details that bridge the gap between hardware and software such as the interrupt vector interrupt supervisor user modes rings 0 to 3 on x86 and the	
	
the general it will be faster with the some points to data on the disk is organized in surfaces tracks and it takes the disk some time to position the reading heads so that you can start reading a now you need five blocks from that you ask for then in a different order than they appear on the physical the cache will help greatly by reading the whole track into memory more blocks than you then reindex them the head starts to it probably will be on the not on the start of the first without have to wait until the first block of the track rotates under the head and start reading the time to read a track would be effectively so with a you can read the blocks of a track in any order and you start reading as soon as the head arrives over the the file system is pretty the os will start to squeeze your data into various empty imagine block 1 is on track block 2 is on track block 3 is again on track without a loose a lot of time for positioning the with a track 5 is kept in ram as the head goes to track 7 and when you ask for block you get it files need a lot of namely where the data blocks for the file in this the cache will keep this data live as you read the saving you from a lot more head cache will allow other programs to access their data in an efficient way as you hog the so overall performance will be this is very important when a second program starts to as you in this the cache will collect some writes before it interrupts your most programs read process it and then write it without the a program would either get into its own way or it would have to implement its own caching scheme to avoid head cache allows the os to reorder the disk say you have blocks on track 7 and 13 but file order asks for track 13 and then more efficient to read track 7 on the way to 13 rather than going all the way to 13 and then come back to while reading lots of data would be faster without a this is only true if your file is the only one on the disk and all is ordered the physical layout of the data is in such a way that the reading heads always start reading a track at the start of the first

the simplest solution be to update references to session objects that are company dependent with a dynamic key based on the createsessionkey generates the corresponding key possibly by a simple concatenation of company and would then differentiate the two or more companies by accessing the session via generated the example company1 would access the session variable via the key and company2 would access the session variable via the key you have have things like littered all over your code base as that would make refactoring your code a real i abstract my session variables into a strongly typed then my session management is contained in one the idea of having a base page class and overriding the session property is a nice way to go if all you session variables are to be company though if you can determine if a particular session key is a generic session variable or company specific then it may still be

there is a difference in how the objects are but they are not python allocates a where it can quickly allocate dictionary objects it dictionaries allocated via the syntax a c call to can come from this free when the dictionary is no longer referenced it gets returned to the free list and that memory block can be reused the fields are reset first dictionary gets immediately returned to the free and the next will reuse its memory you keep a the next dictionary will come from the next free x we can delete the reference to that dictionary and free its slot del the syntax is handled in it can use this optimization mentioned on the other hand is handled like a regular class constructor and python uses the generic memory which does not follow an easily predictable pattern like the free list looking at from python with the syntax it seems to the hashtable based on the number of items storing which is known at parse

there is no way to constrain a generic parameter to be an integral type i guess might be a better word as this does not pertain to just would be nice to be able to do something like t integral or depending on how pedantic you t would suggest that you read by our very own marc gravell and jon it explains why this is such a difficult problem and what can be done to work around introduced generics into which opened the door many elegant solutions to generic constraints can used to restrict the known interfaces to ensure to functionality or for tests singletons implement icomparer iequalitycomparer us to sort elements without having to anything about the in all there is a big gap when it comes to because operators are declared static there is no or similar equivalent interface all the numeric types the flexibility of would make this very hard to do in meaningful of operators on primitive types even exist as instead are direct il to make situation even more demands the concept where the describes the operators to the nullable type but this implemented as a language is not provided by the runtime reflection even more

there then simply include the referrer as one of the that you capture and send back with the redirection the referrer probably available on the client so it will work like sends initial presumably including a dynamically generates the including the referrer in a javascript collects client including the referrer value stored in step sends collected attributes to server with new redirection records referrer parameter although not in the http logs since the referer header have the same value as what the javascript request you realize none of this is reliable anyway because it all depends on the client including the referer header in step and no guarantee that will or if it does that the value you get is i also question the wisdom of doing checks of something as arbitrary as window to determine the validity of a navigation	
	
there was only a small difference between the if table cells are laid out the same way but use slightly different might use if but otherwise go with separate delegate objects of some separation of concerns is the key if writing one method that does two vastly different a sign that your code is not organized well enough to be or forget that view controllers to be magical objects that you can only use with tab bar and navigation perfectly legitimate to write your own view that takes two view controllers and toggles between need to do some to determine whether you need to call and its ilk manually or some magic machinery that may or may not do it for depending on where you add your view controller in the

these methods are very different in terms of what they get compiled though very much similar in terms of try to summarise the differences in is a simple private instance easily going to be the most efficient when is a property a get but no set is a normal parameterless i suspect just offering these examples purely as a point of and realise that such a function is totally useless are private in almost all the layout everything on one is also rather 2 and 3 are going to be equally inefficient compared to 1 in that they both involve the overhead of function i know by memory the cil code that they all compile to someone else can produce but they certainly involve a few more whereas referencing ought to only require a single instruction in sure i can make a very useful comment on best practice without knowing more about the but method 2 a private is generally seen as quite the third method should never be used in my opinion begging to be turned into a i think what you really want is just a plain old private so definitely go for the first public values should always be accessed as properties rather than variables in classes a backing variable to a but that is slightly unrelated to your could find plenty of resources discussing the matter in a quick search note that if your is going to be not modified at any you really want to use a const string mystring1 that helps clarify things a

thing that you could do is session timeout set up a timer that will expire shortly before your actual session have the timer a dialog indicating that the session is about to expire and let the user have the opportunity to renew it back an ajax request to refresh the session have another timer on the dialog that will expire before the time remaining on the actual session runs if this timer then reset the href of the page to the logout url and log the user the timers will need to be reset by user activity on the page ajax	
	
thing to be careful of is to make sure for all static libraries that you and modules that use these static that you use the same char because otherwise your code will but not link typically create my own types based on the stl and even down to boost types like	
	
thing to do is ask if trying to do something that be expressed and if ask yourself if it is really worth that you find a simpler model of what you going to need to think about dependencies among the if you can use feature x independently of feature then make them independent interfaces or pure virtual classes appropriate to the you use them make a class that includes ask yourself why you want featurex and featurey as separate because that pattern of usage suggests not independent after	
	
thing to note is that this have a lot to do with but is rather a pure html possible solution is to use the css attribute fixed and set some fixed width values to all the disadvantage of this approach is that the total table width is fixed so it scale with the window possible approach is to display in columns shorter strings using a utility function that cuts the long strings to a maximum	
	
thing to realize is that once you reach to 6 for the rest of the chain is always	
	
thing you could look at is the this allows you to create an enum that is actually a static which can have bloch talks about this pattern in his book used it in a lot of different and i actually prefer it over plain it works in or pretty much any oo	
	
thing you must consider is wait time on the other end of the having multiple threads will allow you to be waiting for a response on one while preparing the next transaction on the at least how i understand so i think a few threads will turn out better than the other hand you must consider the overhead involved with dealing on multiple the details of the application are important part of the consideration

think a really cool use of javascript that used nearly often enough is for data with you can write one javascript file to validate a check it on the client then check it again on the server side because we trust anything on the client it lets you keep your validation rules quite javascript take which implementation is most and how do you use server side

think anybody has done any outright it falls down to how comfortable you are with decorating your entities with fluent nhibernate is aimed at letting you use nhibernate with a completely unpolluted while attributes require you to alter your this is a persistence concern leaking into your whether a problem for you is whether you should choose attributes or nhibernate also throws a few more things to the table than just also the which allow you to automatically map your the which allow you to greatly reduce repetition in your i repeat but you can read more on the nhibernate	
	
think asking how to make udp reliable may be approaching the question the wrong udp is unreliable more or less by definition ipso you going to get anywhere making the implementation of the protocol more great many applications that use udp use it because they need the nature of it much more than they need the precise reliability of but almost all of these applications still need some mechanism for verifying receipt of certain types of and perhaps even reassembly initial think about sip in voip for latent handshake and very gradual congestion control really acceptable for decent call setup time or but some way of acknowledging messages is definitely needed what provisional responses are in sip or various protocols in use by online games same basic is very likely that the real intent of the assignment even if is not stated clearly is not so much to make reliable as to create a simple program that udp has some primitive reliability abstraction layer within its own communication encapsulated in udp as it

think both styles have their this thinking is kind of crippling to our community in my worked in architectures that were from top to bottom and it was my favorite architecture is for at the ui level and at the functional this also encourages a language barrier that enforces the separation of ui and be a it may be simply that dynamic languages allow the developer to be lazier and to get things done knowing less about the fundamentals of whether this is a good or bad thing is up to the reader	
	
think but i like more working with enunmerations many of the that working on simple this beacuse enums represent something more detailed than a and you can use enums in many cases and many think too that not representing a but a in fact setting your id as enum value of value so this speaks well what you intend to do and what talking for that if going to use still a good idea to use a nullable or some cases when working for example with or a good practice to define a kind of instead of a null so could be useful to use an as i said before it last i think better what kind of null you need to

think doing this at the repository level is a much better mostly because you in the decide to add some method of access to your repository which does not go through mvc a wcf interface to the the question how do you address the cons listed about doing it on the nhibernate out the useful entities is simple i would probably do this via a custom attribute on the entity you can tag the entities you want to or the ones you whichever is out what the controller really intended is going to dispute that you can the i think it is a good idea to do this in a because the separation of the repository should not be dependent on the one method would be to create custom methods on the repository for actions like to track this is especially attractive if there are other aspects of these edits which behave such as different another method is to examine the changes by comparing the old and new versions of the objects and derive the actual nature of the a third method is to make no attempt to derive the nature of the but just store the before and after versions in the log so that the person who reads the log can figure it out for	
	
think enums were made this way as opposed to what you want to meant to hold any meaningful numerical enums are perfect for describing the else in color can be represented by complex types but indulge me for the how about think you get the bottomline enumerations were meant to represent objects or object characteristics that are difficult to represent or do not have meaningful or practical numerical representations and thus the arbitrary assignment to an integer which is the most convenient data type for is as opposed to things like which are	
	
think especially if you be sure what web browser is going to probably be better off sending them a token with the url from the web service that will let them in on the web then the site can set the cookie as if they logged any of that is feasible in your i know if you have access to the site you are sending them a url

think generally not considered a good idea to call for the value reading out of what about the value is what about the value cannot be do you have any exception handling code sure the value is not the value can be parsed before call consider use a nullable type like in this	
	
think going to be better off randomly picking from a list of pregenerated colors that meet your requirements different enough from each than trying to generate colors on the to far as keeping more than one user from having the same one thing seen systems do is to just assign colors locally on the users machine using usually not that important that different users see the same colors for other i care if the colors on my screen are the same as they are on some other as long as all the colors on my screen are in fact it may be desirable for each own text to be distinct is everyone is for	
	
think got the most important bits you more metadata i know the details of what is emitted by a c or but i suspect more names and similar information are included in just look at what the decompiler knows about in a particular stack for example as far as the x86 is you only know how the stack is in il you know what the contents of the stack at the type not the semantic as already il is a higher level abstraction than x86 has no idea what a method or function call or an or a property il has all that information still within c and compilers optimise much more heavily than the this is because the compiler assumes that most of the optimisation can still be performed later by the in some ways it makes sense for the compiler to try to do much as there are various bits of information which are available to the jit but not the optimised code is harder to because further away from being a natural representation of the original source was designed to be x86 was designed to be executed natively via the information the jit compiler needs is similar to that that a decompiler would so a decompiler has an easier time with in some ways this is really just a restatement of the second	
	
think has such a	
	
think has the words of concentrate on the identify and deliver then move on to the next and the this is called and incremental response to the weaknesses of the waterfall will also allow you to create tools and frameworks which should make your development easier and faster as you move will allow you to show your clients functional parts but a word of your client will more than likely keep changing its changing the changing its seen entire projects fail due to these continuous it is out of the scope of this question to mention any more on but please be aware that it more than likely will happen and be prepared to deal with you and the client have functional they can be tested immediately rather than testing one huge completing functional parts iteratively will probably allow you to work at every on most using most tools and the advantage of this is that it will allow you to identify the complexities it is those complex areas that render this following statement first of the code accounts the first of the development the remaining of the code for the other of the acknowledging and understanding those complex areas will allow you to manage your risks and alter your efforts and resources more

think hr is a very low although this also depends on your what your actually and where you been with companies that jump at finding a good person to outsource under is is the most ammount of money the client is willing to fork over without feeling like been ripped how do you find this well i something seen which works preety well is where a company buys a block of hours in then they can tap the resource at will until the hours are in if you have other work which you can make more money off of you need to drop them as a client or raise the raise an existing customers rate too much unless your willing to risk loosing you do drop them recommend doing it as professionally as you never know what the future will	
	
think i can agree with that as a are definitely cases where a relative link makes more with a directory tree of a for if the project is or moved into another absolute links could be confusing if you are talking about there will be cases where relative links make and other times compare having a link to a very generic like grep versus something like multiple versions and target flavors of the gnu compiler tools living on the same in the latter absolute links to the specific tool versions will probably all comes back to what you really want to do in each the general answer is that there is no generalized

think idea of storing the schema table names in a table will your view gets created in that schema by using an inner join of that schema table to syscolumns to create the you might want to consider using dds instead of sql to create a logical file over syscolumns for each not sure how many libraries you are dealing with but if they are just a few this might be use dds with is already a view so to create a dds lf for you have to create it over the underlying qadbifld physical file is also involved but i think you need any fields from that file for this a r qdbifld a s dbilb2 a s dbilfi could use dbilib dbifil if schema and table names are 10 or if you need the syscolumn names you have to do some field wrong as you could also do this with a sql create view select from where and use a table myschema varchar mytable varchar into mytableselect view select from where and ordering is being done on either the dds or the

think of any particular way other than sendkeys to do exactly what you asked take his warnings to sendkeys is very tricky to do possibility to get the same end result is to change your to accept get variables and its fields on you might have 3 variables that populate the company and in vba create a form or sheet that a user can fill out var1 obviously make your var names nicer than mine myurl myurl myurl have a as use something similar for help pages called via a menu and it works a a user clicks a menu and vba opens a url with some data in the favourite only other way interacted with a website from vba programatically is by making calls to directly for get and post though think it would help in your last if you want to stop people gaming your site your should encrypt your not to hard to encrypt then uuencode the data and send that as a request then just urldecode it and decrypt it on the server using the same algorythm you used to encrypt

think submodules are the way to go when it comes to is how you should use just a you develop both main project and within the same directory is called a you tag and merge the all to view your as a is a branch which allows you to access a version of a vendor external component or of and which is only updated with the new version every release of that external that is called a the all system is viewed as a collection of separate components developed on their two approaches are not first strategy is compatible with a you are working both on project and second one is used with but submodules is used to define a of tag you need to each git unlike are pinned to a particular commit and that is what allows you to define a in like the second approach because most of the when you have a project and a their is different are not developed at the same not tagged together at the same nor with the same really prevents that approach in your question is the can be developed and updated from the same working would really urge you to reconsider that as most ide are perfectly capable to deals with multiple and the development can be done in its own dedicated an emap plugin for both joomla and both the plugin and the code is part of not of are developed while the plugin is inside all paths are the structure is and they must be distributed together even though each project has its own i understand you are in a configuration where the development environment set of files you are working is quite the same than the distribution environment same set of file is copied on the release all comes done to a granularity both sets of files cannot exist one without the then they should be viewed as one big project but that force them to be tagged and merged as one depends on the other can be developed then they should be in their own git repository and the first one depending on a specific commit of the second as a if the is defined in the right subtree of the first all relative paths are original thread listed issues with submodules primarily that download include them to and that they get stuck on a particular am not sure download is an issue that developing with article does of people cloning your fork will have no problem pulling down your as registered the public clone url for the the gh submodule gh submodule pull the submodules into the current for the get stuck on a particular that is the all point of a allowing you to work with a of tagged version of instead of a latest potentially unstable set of need to avoid both subtrees and submodules and would rather address this need without arguing too much if the approach is requirement is a perfectly legitimate and i do not want to judge its my previous answers are only here to provide a larger context and try to illustrate the options usually available with a generic scm merge should be the answer but would imply to merge back only commits made for files for the main and not commits made for the if you can manage that kind of partial i would reckon it is the right path to do not see however a native git way to do what you want that does not use or hope a true git guru will post here a more adequate	
	
think such support exists in current i think what i want to do could be solved by a but the problem i have with is generally they and i find a imperative style much more have a lot of simple though diverse little state investigated iterators in but that get me exactly where i want to current looking at putting together a dsl in but not sure if be able to get behaviour into and be able to serialize it as is limited fictional example of what like to the main issue is that at any point in a routine you may need to get user the time between inputs could be very long so the state of service will need to be serialized to def var lever var device def var color var shape return have a working in it on the support in so code looks like roll yield if roll can be with some user however serialize the whole state of the game can be defined as a sequence of i serialize the game state up to the point at where a coroutine started then the remaining list of so to looks like if return return state if is return r for input in return still find this as i end up having to use on almost every rather not have to specifically decorate a also it quite fails at investigating going a functional as functional languages seem to have better support for currently looking computational hopeful that with strong enough metaprogramming facilities i can automate the state storage if i go the pretty sure i can fall back on the i used to serialize that supports serializing	
	
think that a 5 times speed improvement is not all that important for me is not an order of magnitude although if you consume cpu power at the scale of google it can be a worth while investment to have some of your staff work on of the speed improvements will likely make it into cpython rid of the gil is interesting in principle but will likely reveal lots of problems with modules that are not thread safe once the gil is do not think i will use unladen swallow any time soon but like how giving attention to performance may improve the regular python

think the best way to begin to create a corporate framework is to begin by harvesting existing code out of current corporate building a framework from scratch by talking to a ba without writing code for a concrete project might lead you to over design the framework in some areas and totally miss some necessary features in others it might place artificial constraints on your framework clients for no good entry on and this for a more complete not familiar with web focus but guessing it would affect it in some if you go with a harvested your usage of it in the first few applications you build will shape how you use web focus within the

think the check makes sense when you want to be sure the file was there in the first as you said settings there is a file i will try and merge the existing settings instead of blowing them cases would be when a user tells me to do something with a yes i know the openfiledialog will check if a file exists this is i vaguely remeber back in vb6 this was not the so verifying the file existed that they just told me to use was rather not program by miss the you might try and access the an exception is thrown and then when you go to create the the file was already placed which now causes your exception handling code to go on the so i guess we could then have an exception handler in our exception handler to catch that the file changed yet rather try and prevent not use them to control another time to check for attributes such as size is when your waiting for a file operation to yes you never know for sure but with a good algorithim and depending on the system writting the file you might be able to handle a good deal of cases a system running for five years which watched for small files coming over and it uses a the same api as the file system and then starts polling waiting for the file to stop before raising an event that the file is ready to be

think the premature optimization quote is used by too many to avoid thinking about the hard stuff concerning how well the application will i guarantee the users want you to think about how to design it so it will run as fast as is not to say you should be timing but the design phase is the easiest place to optimize and not cost lots of time are often several ways to do you should pick in the design phase the one which is most likely to perform the best it turns out to be one of the times when it the then optimize this should trump the need to have easy to read you considering performance in the design you going to have a well designed that mean it should be the only concern in a database rate it as 3rd in right after data integrity and but trying to fix a system where poorly performing techniques were used throughout because the developers thought they were easier to understand is a being a user of such a system where you have to wait for minutes everytime you want to move from one screen to another is a nightmare reallly should spend all day everyday for at least a using their for everyone who is stuck with the badly designed it costs less to design properly than to fix later and considering performance is critical to designing work somewhere where the orginal developers drank the koolaid about premature optimization and did everything the way they thought was simplest which in almost every case was the wrong choice from a performance now we are at 10 times the size we were three years ago and every screen on every website takes 30 seconds or so to load worse times and we are losing customers because of but changing it will be too hard because at the base they designed the database without considering how it would perform and redesigning a database with many many gigabytes of data into a new structure is way too time consuming and if it had been designed to perform from the start it would be both easier to maintain and faster for the we talking about the need to performance tune the top 10 slowest queries we are talking about the fact that the overall structure requires a drastic change that would affect virtually every query against the to perform do micro optimization until you nmeed but please do the macro consider if is this the best way before you commit to the write cursors to hit tables with millions of records when a statement will try to have as few tables as possible becasue that seems to be a more elegant solution when the tables are storing disparate items as and causing every single query to hit the same table and causing every delete to check all sorts of foreign key tables that will not ever have a record for that type of entity takes minutes to delete one record from the main table in our a real joy when something goes wrong in an import data from a client and we have to delete let me tell	
	
think the problem is that linq has no way to use the fact that your sequence is already especially it cannot that applying the function retains the would suggest to use the method together with a that does only comparison of the first query chars might be since not if the query string will always be the first or the second parameter to could even use the standard string since binarysearch returns a negative number which you can complement in order to get the index of the first element that is larger than your have then to start from the returned index both to find all elements matching your query

think you might be better off using an elastic block store to store your files instead of an ebs is akin to a on s3 that can be mounted into your ec2 instance without having to copy the data each thereby allowing you to persist your data between ec2 instances without having to write to or read from s3 each

think you only need a single and an appropriate widget class that contains references to the other it might help to make it a custom dictionary so that you can simply add a widget and have it derive the key from the filepath public class widgetdictionary provide suitable constructors public void widget widget if null widget public class public string filepath private widgets new public get return to widgets from to do you simply look the widget up in the widget repository by file var repository new string filepath var widget do you can remove and the widget to the repository after changing file references to the widget held by other widgets will still be widget this could probably be implemented as a method on dictionary as public void widget string newpath if throw new var widget if widget do simply reference the filepath you want to automatically have other widgets remove their references to a widget when it is deleted probably want to have the widget class implement idisposable and have the ability to add event handlers to a dispose event so that interested widgets can register a method that will remove the widget being disposed from their collection of related see msdn on how to set up and use event	
	
think you should bundle it since you are probably letting someone else pay for the bandwidth codeplex and sourceforge are nice also that makes the users life alot you can also just delete modules you need which makes the file a bit in our app on the first run it checks if all files exist and downloads the zend framework from zends on the first run you could download it from and use a php function to unzip it and place it in the appropriate that would be an alternative which would take a little time to do but would dramatically reduce the	
	
think you should consider a bit of in do as the romans has properties ingrained into all of designers and code it is almost an inseperable part of the if you choose to use accessors instead of normal properties you will be creating a library which has a very different appearance than what every other programmer is accessors will only increase the chances that you create code which is incompatible with various for there are many tools out there which special case properties and fields and provide special features for you will have an equivalent construct but no tool	
	
think you should definitely expand the thought process to include some doubt for specific this should be a very very rare thing to say go for the global style sheets but refactor your css html in a way that pages have to have and if in the end a few lines of markup in the global who better to have it in a consistent place

think you should separate the rendering from the game have at least two different kind of entity that holds the data and logic it should what happens if it runs out of hit that is the particles attached to the representation can access the entity so it knows the hit a controller if the entity can be directly controlled by a human or an ai a car in a car that sounds like the there are lots of resources about see article from or guerrilla guide to game by jorrit for your animation for a dying when the model updates its entity and figures out it has no more hit it could set a flag to say dead and remove the entity from the game from then when the view it reads the flag and starts the dying but it can be difficult to decide where to store this flag since the entity object should a better way in my humble when your entity you could send an event to all listeners that are registered to the unitdiedevent that belongs to this specific then remove the entity from the the entity representation object is listening to that and its handler starts the dying when the animation is the entity representation can finally be design can be

this answer is based on the idea that need to do similar things for different entities and different properties elsewhere in your if you need to convert the list of viewvalues to a list of longs by then stick with your original if you want a more reusable read would declare an interface for the interface public result you can write a single generic conversion results new for element return you can define simple projections like static final new public long return apply it just like ids using bracing and longer lines makes the projection declaration a bit shorter all of this would be a lot nicer with lambda but never

this code there is a lot wrong with elementtype is an enum in the not an so this has to be a custom annotation it uses a common class name for an creating it uses a long instead of an or at least a declared constant to define a type which is most likely not to be understood as a and it declares a class name in all lower	
	
this color has an easy same color depending on the language search query and personal preference have a different display display name is not but it needs to be passed on to each page so the user is confronted with the same label every time the color is just for keeping this explanation go with me on this the name can also be blank the parameter is there are many of such parameters and the parameters are optional and i want to push all these optional parameters to the ugly query i have made a single url parameter to identify the color that basically puts the color id and the optional parameters in one separated with a custom have a helper method that generates this string and one that parses this working out fine so but i feel there is probably a better way to do any way to make this case

this is a fixed list it seems it or else you store it as an i use main reason to use over is for ease of use with querying actually go with a variant of store the value as an integer and map to an enum on data also create a table representing the enum with the value as the pk and the name as another that way and efficient to use with your but also easy to get the logical value with querying and other uses that use your data access	
	
this is a great practice to have in completely logical to wrap related values into a containing would go ever it would also serve your purpose to never modify these values instead write functions which act on these values as a pair inside your struct to change length and alter that way you can add invariant checks and also make it very easy to

this particular i think that the weakest link your application is using md5 rather than the manner in which md5 is is that given that it is possible to generate such that because the is limited because there are any tricks to reduce the search is not necessarily this means that if you know you can generate such that this giving a valid in this case the message still remains the and p been if the attacker tries to forge message with a then it is highly unlikely that unless in which they would have the if they have the then that means that it matter if you used sha or since checking if v is equivalent to checking if that sha might take constant time longer to that affect the complexity of the on given the you really ought to just go ahead and use there is no sense in not using unless there is a serious drawback to using second thing is you probably store the password in your database in what you should store is a hash of the and then use in your the hash would be time and you could safely store in your an attacker stealing your database something like sql would still be able to forge i see any way around

through controls can work but error i worked on a project that used that technique it was a delphi project not and it did work as expected but it was very difficult to update if a control was added or this may have been not it worked by creating a single event handler which was then attached to each the handler would then use rtti to determine the type of the then it would use the name property in a large select statement to find the validation code to if the validation an error message was sent to the user and the control was given to make things more the form was divided into several tabs and the proper tab had to be visible for child control to get the my would much rather use a passive view design pattern to remove all business rules from the form and push them into a presenter depending on the state of your form that may be more work than your willing to

understanding of async is that notified when done via an interrupt of some sort so you can do more at that with buffered you do it and forget about you never hear about that particular least how it is with the huge intelligent disk arrays we deal idea of async is that you begin the and return to doing other when the is notified and can do more in other not waiting around for it to for the synchronous read you request some input and then wait around while read from the buffering there just involves reading more than you need so available on the next read without going out to the device to get you simply start the process to read then you go off and do something else while whether by polling or an you later discover that the read is finished and the data is available for you to not sure i can see the advantage of one over the buffered sync writes will return almost immediately unless the buffer is full the only time when an async write may have an

unix development nice little black box of is losing market share to more modern technologies and development there are certainly many great ides out there today with support for web development like visual and many web developers find them unnecessary and continue to work entirely in standard text editor like vi and unix platform has a very rich selection of contemporary web development frameworks ruby on and django are two of the most popular you could develop an application using one of these frameworks without the use of an ide entirely from the command both of these frameworks are open and run on a variety of unix and gnome desktop has several accessibility features that might aid you in your the on mobility in the gnome desktop accessibility guide might be the most relevant for that would give you the best of both worlds in that have a very rich commandline but could also run gui apps and ides such as macos x might give you a similar you find the benefit from the ms accessibility features in windows too great to perhaps consider installing and learning to use my understanding of is that it allows you to execute many gui based tasks entirely from the commandline you to interact with windows in a more unix like

updated the example to better illustrate my i realised it was missing one specific point namely the fact that the method always takes a label type so the factory can decide what type of label to thing it might need to obtain more or less information depending on what type of label it wants to have a factory class that returns objects representing labels to be sent to a factory class looks like class largelabel public string trackingreference private public trackingreference class smalllabel public string trackingreference private public trackingreference class public ilabel string switch case return new case return new that i create a new label called i want to return this from the but it needs some additional class customlabel public string trackingreference private public string customtext private public string trackingreference customtext means my factory method has to class public ilabel string string switch case return new case return new case return new like this because the factory now needs to cater for the lowest common but at the same time the customlabel class to get a custom text i could provide the additional factory method as an but i want to enforce the fact that the customlabel needs the otherwise only ever be given empty is the correct way to implement this class knows too

use distributed version control for both and disconnected if you have distant sometimes you rely on the internet or not fast enough and slows down then having independent server which can synchronize back replicates branches back and is very useful and speed up probably one of the most common scenarios for companies since most of them are still concerned of practices where each developer has its own replicated disconnected truly distributed if you every developer has his own repository which is replicated back and forth with his peers or the central very convenient to go to a location or just go home with your and continue being able to switch checkout and checkin look at the run annotates and so without having to access the remote then whenever you go back to the office you just replicate your changes back with a few

used but i used svn and bazaar is similar in philosophy to so i can answer you in general advantage of the so called distributed version control systems is that the repo and the code are together on your and you are not dependent on a remote repo for every developer has a his own copy of the repo to which he commits you can check previous without being connected to the officiality of repository is granted by virtue of human not technical in you only have one which is you and all the other people commit in you commit to your own and another developer to his own and each of you can push his modifications to the officially designed repo when he clear advantage is that operations in a dvcs are blazing svn becomes incredibly slow when you start having a lot of stuff in your this can become annoying very the minus dvcs are more difficult to but you can use a dvcs as a centralized vcs if you

used pointing to shared code in practice for a few years we have had some interesting problems with it that you should probably consider before using it here is the structure that we directories in both and in a project contain external definitions that pull in the common svn pget on lib1 lib2 problem that run into is multifaceted but related to tagging and branching our source as the projects change throughout the externals definition that i showed above has a few pretty severe problems if you want to have reproducible refers to a dynamic target refer to an explicit you branch using the externals are copied verbatim since they are really just properties attached to the some of the other svn commands and actually interpret the when you tag a you really want to preserve the state of the project for all this means that you have to the externals to a specific revision so you need to change the externals definition to explicit refer to the revision that you want this solves one facet of the you have to maintain multiple incompatible branches of the common then you have to specify which branch you want explicitly along with the to this can be a bit of a luckily someone out there in subversion land write the script that automates some of this we are still have struggling with some of the difficulties supporting this in a field deployed product with a bunch of shared code and a mandate of three different versions in the field at any you do go down this then be sure to consider how you will maintain the linkages as the projects grow and found that a little bit of time thinking about a process will go a long way

used with boolean operands the operator is a logical operator just as but the difference is that the operator does short circuit evaluation and the operator does means that the second operand is always evaluated using the but using the operator the second operand is only evaluated if the first operand evaluates to result of the expression is always the same for both but if the evaluation of the second operand causes something else to that is only guaranteed to happen if you use the a b x 0 here b is still as the operand was not y 0 here b is as the operand was evaluation of the operator can be used to write shorter as the second operand only is evaluated if the first operand is instead of writing like has to be at least three else if has to be at least three can write like null has to be at least three second operand is only evaluated if the first is so you know that you can safely use the string reference in the second operand as it can not be null if the second operand is most cases you would want to use the operator rather than the if the first operand is there is no need to evaluate the second operand to get the a lot of people know that you can use the operator with boolean so they would get confused when seeing it used that way in the

users have provide some very useful links above so i am not going to bother with i have done a similar research in jaas for web application and has ran into a until i finally realize jaas is a framework tackling security at a different then web applications in the java it is build to tackle security issues in java se not java is a security framework built for securing things at a much lower level then some example of these things are code and resources available at the jvm hence all these ability to set policy files in the jvm since java ee is built on top of java a few modules from jaas were reused in java ee security such as the loginmodules and that in addition to java ee there is also spring security known as which similar to native java ee security tackles a much higher in the securing it is a separate security implementation and is not built on top of standard java ee although it behaves similarly in many unless you are looking to secure resources in the java se level system i see any real use of jaas other than the using the common class and just focus on using spring security or plain old java ee security which both solve a lot of common web application security

using a lock is the right way to you can lock on any but as mentioned in other locking on your resource itself is probably the easiest and you may want use a lock pair instead of just a single to decrease concurrency rationale for that is that if you have only one thread but several threads you do not want a read operation to block an other read but only a read block a write or i am more a java so you will have to change the syntax and dig up some doc to apply that in but are part of the standard concurrency package in so you could write something class implements private final lock private final lock private final resource public reentrantreadwritelock rwl new public t try return finally public t try return finally someone can come up with a code

variant of option 2 hybrid of 1 and may make after polymorphism is the standard solution to are as but need to behave differently in situation a method would probably tie the model to the ui too but presumably the different renderings you want at the ui level reflect semantic or behavioural differences at the model could those be captured in a for instead of an outright could it be a to which a and b return different values but it is still up to the ui to decide how to translate that into a your more general of can we handle behaviour that we or allow to be accessed polymorphically via the base for example if the base class under our your options are probably option the visitor pattern or a helper in both cases you are effectively farming out the polymorphism to an external entity in option the ui the presenter or which performs an instanceof check and does different things depending on whether a b or in visitor or the helper the new given your visitor is probably overkill if you were not to change the base class to accommodate it be possible to implement it i so suggest a simple class called something like abstract class renderer public static renderer if instanceof return new return new public abstract color implementations of arenderer and brenderer per your ui encapsulates the type checking and bundles the code up into reasonably classes with clear without the conceptual overhead of if your hierarchy or function set is more complex than what shown visitor could well be more but many people find visitor hard to get their heads around and i would tend to avoid it for simple situations but your mileage may

very convenient to have r scripts for doing simple plots from the command running r from bash scripts is not convenient at the ideal might be something i been able to make either of those option is keeping the scripts purely in and invoking it with or occasionally a script will rely on obscure command line switches at which point part of the code exists outside the sneaking things into r from bash via a local the desired switches are then everything implies except option is a bash script to store the r flags and be painlessly which then calls the r the problem is that this means a single program just got split into two files which now have to be keep in transferred to new machines option i currently despise least is embedding the r in a bash usage message to catch bad input without invoking any bash of r code goes in a single executable and easily handles the problem is that combining bash and r like this pretty much eliminates the possibility of any ide not failing on one or the and makes my heart hurt real there some better way the best way to use r scripts on the command

was curious about this all fine to read documentation and theoretical but i like to balance those with empirical have a mysql table that has records in the table is in my own private so i know the contents are static and nobody else is using the i think this effectively removes all outside affects on i have a table with an primary key field that i know will never be null that i will use for my where clause test id is not only other possible glitch i see in running tests is the the first time a query is run will always be slower than subsequent queries that use the same refer to that below as the cache seeding just to mix it up a little i ran it with a where clause i know will always evaluate to true regardless of any data said here are my where where id is not null where 9 min sec 6 min sec 2 min sec 6 min sec 1 min sec 2 min sec 6 min se 1 min sec 1 min 5 min sec 1 min sec 2 min sec 5 min sec 1 min sec 2 min 6 min sec 2 min sec 2 min 6 min sec 1 min sec 1 min is considered the cache seeding it is expected to be slower than the say the results speak for usually edges out the adding a where clause dramatically decreases the access time even if a clause you know will evaluate to the sweet spot appears to be where id is not would love to see other perhaps with smaller tables or with where clauses against different fields than the field sure there are other variations i taken into

was intended as a comment on a previous but i guess too a child class with a constructor that takes an instance of a parent class and copies data from it is a fairly widespread one way to minimize the headache that this can cause with multiple levels of inheritance and other classes is to create a protected function that does this in this instance call it consider that we have three and they each inherit from the other in that class private string public string get return set name protected void name we define class employee private int public public public int get return set employeeid protected new void employeeid we follow the same example for class manager private string public public public string get return set department protected new void department the method in each class declared so that we can change the and is there to provide shallow copy functionality to inherited note that this pattern creates a new object that just has the same data as the old the old object still exists and existing references point to your new actually changing an type is not

was the first have one or more mainboards with one or more cpu chips on the main problem here was that the cpus would have to expose some of their internal data to the other cpu so they get in their next step was one chip on the mainboard but it had some parts twice internally so it could execute two instructions at the same current development is basically the original idea complete but in a single the chip designers can easily put the additional wires for the sync signals into the chip of having to route them out on a then over the crowded mainboard and up into a second computers today are they have lots of mainboards with usually cpus on each cpu is and each has its own you got that pretty much just a few minor duplicates internal to reduce context switch resources can arithmetic unit you can do several integer or even floating point calculations or you can do an add and a multiply at the same time but not add and main problem with is that code running on them will eventually access the there are n cpus but only one bus to access the so you must have some hardware which makes sure that each cpu gets a fair amount of ram that accesses to the same part of the ram cause problems and most that cpu 2 will be notified when cpu 1 writes to some memory address which cpu 2 has in its internal if that cpu 2 will happily use the cached oblivious to the fact that it is imagine you have tasks in a list and you want to spread them to all available so cpu 1 will fetch the first element from the list and update the cpu 2 will do the for efficiency both cpus will not only copy the few bytes into the cache but a whole that may the assumption is when you read byte soon read both cpus have a copy of the memory in their cpu 1 will then fetch the next item from the without cache it have noticed that cpu 2 has changed the and it will start to work on the same item as cpu is what effectively makes so side effects of this can lead to a performance which is worse than what get if the whole code ran only on a single the solution was you can easily add as many wires as you need to synchronize the you could even copy data from one cache to another of a cache line without having to flush and reload or the cache logic could make sure that all cpus get the same cache line when they access the same part of real simply blocking cpu 2 for a few nanoseconds until cpu 1 has made its the main reason why is simpler than is that on a you simply run all wires between the two chips which need to make sync plus a signal only travels tops of in a you usually have much and forget on a signals start to influence each other we like to think that 0 is 0v and 1 is 5v but in is something between when dropping a line from and and is anything above you have everything inside of a single signals run much faster and you can have as many as you like almost signal crosstalk is much easier to

was wondering if it was possible to get the nth return value from a function without having to create dummy variables for all return values before say i have the following function in suppose that only interested in the third return this can be accomplished by creating one dummy but i think this is kind of would think that you might be able to do something like one of the following but you there any elegant ways to do this that do far the best solution is to simply use the variablethatiwilluse as a dummy this saves me from having to create a real dummy variable that polutes the workspace that i would need to in the solution is to use the variablethatiwilluse for every return value up until the interesting return values after can simply be still think this is very ugly but if there is no better then i guess accept the to elegantly ignore some return values of a matlab

way described no reason that you need simply synchronize access to your data to ensure that it is in a consistent state when by i do not mean synchronize the entire data structure would end up blocking either producer or synchronize only those bits that are being and only at the time that you update find that most of the work can take place in an unsynchronized for if building a you can identify the node where the insert needs to synchronize on that do the then continue	
	
way i the memory allocation and is to pass it off to custom pass the container an let it worry about malloc and when i remove the object let it worry about the of course this only works if you are only storing an object in one if i have object references all over the place i will create the equivalent of constructor and destructor methods with c void object i mean anything you would point to not

way supposed to form the version is like first number is the interface version of the whenever you change the public this number goes second number is the revision number of the current whenever you make an internal change without changing the public this number goes third number is a build it is the this tells you how many interfaces are so for example if interface version 4 is strictly a superset of interfaces 3 and but totally incompatible with then the lowest interface number the x and z numbers are very important for the system to determine if a given app can use a given given what the app was compiled the y number is mainly for tracking bug

web authors validate their in which very little to choose between the doctypes and no good reason to change from the ide the only practical difference to browsers between strict and transitional is that strict triggers standards mode and transitional triggers almost standards mode in pages that actually require standards mode behaviour are very few and far between and certainly affect the overall proportions that you see on the worth noting that html 5 is being written without a largely because the authors of that recognise that the transitional doctypes of xhtml and html4 are widely

went through this a few years you word to convert the file into some other xml some app to convert to another such as the word api through ole and extract the information find any generic libraries to read word and back then all of the applications that read word files only worked for a word changed often enough that they had trouble keeping were some documents that listed the specifics of the older word file the underlying file structure is outrageously without a lot of resources it would be hard to keep code in sync with the file i used perl to drive word and create new but the solution was too later i switch the whole application to work with pdfs and gave up on w

wethercotes wizard stores the connection string when you set up the but that mean you make it how depends on which version you are but in general if you expand the files under your dataset you will find a file like or you can open those files and search for this is usually a private variable and is set in an init function in the can make the setting dynamic by adding code like the string get return if new that if you regenerate the dataset you will likely lose this section of and without refactoring the dataset you may have to add it to several

what does a singleton provides global access to an instance of an guarantees that no more than one instance of that type can be you use a singleton when you need of these that is are generally we tend to avoid them when building your application around the assumption that more than one instance it is an is because you typically find out the assumption perhaps you want to be able to create multiple instances for caching perhaps it turns out you need more than one more than one or perhaps threading performance requires you to give each thread its own any you need to enforce the one instance may if you only need one simply create only one but leave the constructor publicly visible so that more instances can be created it turns out to be other both of the features offered by a singleton are actually in we our data to be globally and we to take away flexibility for no you do need one of the features offered by a implement that one without the if you need something to be globally make it a not a and if you do need to enforce that only one instance will exist think of any plausible situations where want perhaps an object representing a physical hardware then implement without the global only real world application of singletons ever seen has been architect has read the gof and decided to cram design patterns in or programmer stuck in the comfortable with the whole and wants to code which means storing data as and singletons sounds like an way to make globals without getting yelled key point is that a singleton mixes very and each very rarely you want one of those in any given

what i understand of just reading the bugzilla the bug manifests when two distinct problems hash algorithm generates collisions for urls that are from the bug seems to mean every 4 characters perhaps the urls are the logic for dealing with hash collisions fails because they flushed the previous url with the same hash value to disk if you have a page with two very similar urls this might happen on some versions of it generally happen on different i would since then ff will have time to flush the entries to disk avoiding the timing if you have multiple resources that are all loaded from the same make sure they have a run of 9 characters that are completely one way you might ensure this is by appending a querystring you with a random bit of something

what i you will need ruby dbi and ruby to my knowledge the ado dbd for dbi is no longer the installation below is not a comprehensive walk thru on how to get all the required moving parts like freetds installed it will also assume gem installations of both the dependent libraries and the adapter should be noted that this version of the adapter was developed using both the ancient version of dbi up to the current stable release of because later versions of dbi will be changing many it is highly recommended that you max your install to version which the examples below for the time being we are not supporting dbi versions higher than the good news is that if you were using a very old dbi with technically this adapter will still work for but be warned your path is getting old and may not be supported for gem install dbi gem install gem install update your to include the reload your by logging out and in on ubuntu server i needed to install some sudo aptitude install unixodbc sqsh freetds installed i could configure it like cat host port tds version important thing here is which is the dsn that use when connecting to the the and port are and worth noting that i had to use specifically as the tds freetds is not too sqsh acumenserver username symbol has different size in shared consider copyright scott is free software with absolutely no more information type use select top 1 lastname from row up necessary to configure cat tds driver cat odbc connection via then tested the connection with isql acumenserver username help quit use database context to sqlexecute returned returns select top 1 firstname from returns rows so got odbc using freetds to connect to a remote mssql all left is to add ruby into the sudo aptitude install last thing to test is that ruby can use dbi and odbc to hit the actual and easy to require dbh a more complete test with sql mind top 10 firstname from rec puts here fix the odbc lib being in the wrong freetds you can either edit the path in the file for the driver section or cp the into way works when accessing mssql from the found this to be then in the

what programming tools should are there any was the only language to come and even it was in two dialects and want to look at the fred fish collection or aminet for more as finding commercial compilers will be i limited to plain text are there ides and debugging pretty much back to ides are not readily i would look at something like dme macro also available on the fred fish collection or aminet it provides some basic macro construction facilities that will no tools are already can this are there free fred or like to learn a traditional could you reccomend it was written by chris a little but it should provide you with all that you need to get including the proper bindings and the language is compiled and runs at speeds comparable to should i use to compile language you or lattice c were the c compilers of the time you can find good with manx tending towards 16bit and lattice towards there were a few tiny there is 68k assembly neato instruction set a pascal possibly as well as dice free c but looking for something could you suggest tools i use to debug the suggested commercial tools are far and few going to have to dig through the public domain archives to find there any libraries i should aware such as gui libraries are all built is the name of the library that provides basic windowing will provide you with and will provide you with support for handing the unique approach to before you get that want to look at which was the heart soul of the it provides linked list message passing io and was heavily throughout the if you understand understand the innards of the rest of the in mind that the state of the system will look more like an embedded game as there will be no memory smp all of these things could not easily be added due to design constraints that were introduced just before the first amiga i seem to recall that the issue was surrounding how it would handle multiple processors and memory protection given that the entire microkernel runs in a cpu but not the magic number is which is a memory that address is the pointer to the exec is not only a microkernel but also a and with it you can bootstrap into the rest of the system via libraries that could not be located will automatically be loaded from disk via this is how the amiga dealt with the issue of portable code all of the code was written using offsets into a pointer to the of a library and there were no fixed other than address every library has a call table of 6 bytes per entry jump that then vectors off into the correct entry it was easy to write your own provided you had the correct format for your device drivers the structure of libraries and used the same concept to provide default if the names are slightly this information is off the top of my head from nearly 20 years things to running workbench from the winuae that was the last great i can access from my windows hard but want to go as much as like to code and compile it workbench if running winuae in a1200 sure if that the model of hardware it was a good budget but try setting it for a3000 if that was a nice machine before commodore had an application installed called it a if emacs is your i would look at some of the native and very a similar amiga aware that you can code with c but i want to learn a draco is for it has most of the bindings for compiles and officially a language given tied to a specific hardware very let everyone know how it turned

while ago we started developing a new project which internally has about different that are heavily related to each other either via or then we went with a native oodbms system basically because what it allowed us to do was to take our object model and simply add a few persistence related here and there and we were ready to over time we ran into more and more really a reasonable limitations that forced us to implement slow workarounds resulting in mediocre performance and scalability issues on the horizon and license fees have almost increased by a factor of 5 for us with no change on our end got bought by big currently starting to look for a solution in terms of as well as we had a look at other and always came across major breakers for us and therefore we started to look a little further and basically are thinking about orms which hopefully let us keep most of the focus on our objects instead of wrangling with basically my does anyone have any experience with entity framework or any other orm that keeps configuration as maintainable as possible as well as performs well in related the amount of data we store is not amazing or extensive in any sort expect a total of 100k instances across all entities within the next 3 anyone have any for an orm experience migrating from an oodbms to from oodbms to orm framework sql

will take several weeks to change over to a new or a of you have to get away from old forms way of thinking web in that many pages we over 300 that would be you change the view of your entire you shift from old thinking of page need to create to the mvc way of thinking of function do we need to implement i myself took control of a project that has over 3300 files in the project alone the 11 supporting one thing that i am architecting is how mvc will drastically cut down the number of physical files down to around 310 or because i am moving away from one another to a the function i want to way of looking at pages as the function you are trying to you instead start abstracting pieces of that page out into common can greatly scale with this because now you have a template for the way you want it to you just need to implement another to change the look of that view you want to no 2nd no additional as for web as you this calls for a different way of there is the htmlhelper that is used for basic rendering and i use the same concept with an abstracted class called myprojecthelper that renders my onto the page i always created a server control for my displaynames in the this allowed me to control the way that displayname was especially with a switch to facebook connect and other with i no longer use a but a on a viewmodel to render that since this is only part of the ui this will render the anchor as needed with any options i wish the abstract is inherited by the collegeprojectviewmodel that picks up on the text power lies in the ability to no longer require a but instead or methods of what you want to do with your by changing to this way of you really can scale with as many method you create on your it really speeds things up on a mass scale

windows console follows the same line ending convention that is assumed for or for that matter for physical it needs to see both cr and lf to properly move to the next there is a lot of software infrastructure between an ansi c program and that in any standard c library function is going to try to do the right assuming allowed it the this is why and modifiers for the parameter were default for most and in particular for and then any printed is converted to a crlf and the reverse happens for to turn off that use the the terminals traditionally hooked to boxes including the dec vt100 emulated by xterm also needs both cr and in the the conversion from a newline character to a crlf sequence is handled in the tty device driver so most programs need to know about and the and modifiers are both on those if you need to send and receive characters on a tty without that you need to look up or the system calls it depends your otherwise ansi c program is avoiding c library to the console because you need access to the character color and other then whether you need to send cr or not will depend on which win32 api calls you are using to send the

work in a bigco as we have a growing curve here taking over both from vb6 and from there is and will be a lot of java written which is i really think that the will be technology is i understand why people go that but in a typical large shop it seems to be far too suggest instead of trying to combat java on the just look for the opportunities for where it is clearly better for a particular if you are writing a small app to do some crud used by 10 or less it makes a lot of sense in my mind to do it with winforms instead of as a webapp because so much quicker to write them and with so few users you have a distribution you also get the full integrated security thing if you use ad been the approach we have here it has allowed to penetrate all in other it is clearly better to go java team so any large company is going to have a lot of microsoft and a lot of javaesque hardware sitting around to run stuff on so it seem to me that in bigco it should matter much at all which of the two big platforms you sometimes is sometimes i think a big shop should foster think in a few we will be seeing python more like or ruby as a viable alternative

would a new object know which network to join or depending on what exactly you there are number of can use less precise timer than every for example something like time channel time the objects rezzed at nearly the same time are likely to have same channel according to the above although probably want to make sure that time 1000 is not near 0 or 1000 and perhaps use time 10000 in that than you can create some sort of discovery for rezzed object says hello on control server for each network in area responds with channel number of its chooses network he wants to nobody object becomes server for its own by incrementing control channel by some number example object wants to create its own network it increments highest channel in use by and creates its own you can combine both methods use to derive say and if server responds become otherwise become you can check appropriate higher and lower channel to avoid having two networks because of time rollover differences in rezzing of	
	
would actually look very closely at something like adobe it is cross platform and can be based so chances are you have a heck of a lot to learn except maybe a javascript library or it has the ability to talk to a local datastore or over the interweb to a webservice or restful development is free with check out some of the stuff written in

would assume that of the sharepoint means you use visual studio to extend not sure whether using sharepoint designer would count or sharepoint can be pretty powerful for something that requires no if trying to solve a complex the ootb sharepoint application will likely have some very rough you may also run into a wall where ootb functionality simply allow you to mimic a particular data structure or process in a useful you ever have to get into customizing and extending the learning curve gets sharepoint development takes some dedication to be likely become a primary focus of you or other programmers on your the book microsoft windows sharepoint services is a good introduction to the development side of you commit to make sure to get a fairly clear roadmap of where the application will be take some time to get familiar with the basic ootb features of wss3 has an virtual pc to make sure it will handle you want to clearly set up expectations for what you can and do out of the and how it will affect your team of programmers if you have to go beyond

would be the best way to serialize a given binary tree and inturn evaluate a unique id for each serialized binary i need to serialize the and generate a unique id representing that so that whenever i come across a similar it would serialize to the same value and hence i can deduce that found a we assume that each node has properties that are in the above it would be the numbers assigned to each node and hence they would always generate the same ids for similar trying to do this in algorithms already exist to perform such serialized tree matching using serialization of tree and unique id generation for each

would declare your main jquery scripts within the master as you would then any page specific js files could be loaded within the content controls that reference the head a better option would be to look into the and controls these can provide you with a lot more control over the way your js files are served to the you would place a scriptmanager control in you master and add a reference to the jquery core code in in your page that requires some custom js or a jquery you can scriptmanager allows you to do things like control where on the page scripts are rendered with better after by setting it to	
	
would definitely use mmap for the this would make it easy to directly access the data and flush to disk when the only thing you would have to control is where the file is mapped in the address so you can move it possibility for memory management is to create a different file for each and use level defragmentation rather than implementing it you never mentioned what you are but if it already has online defragmentation i would use if you are using linux and can use you can use i would expect defragmentation to be highly optimized and it would take a lot less effort than to implement on your own in one big

would probably help you to understand the php data types and how affected when you do operations to variables of various you say you have variable in php say but what type is that probably a since an integer have that value just so when you do operator a string and an i know how to add a string and an but i do know how to convert a string into an and then add two ints so let me do and then it converts to because the php rules for converting a string to an integer say that any number of leading zeroes in the string are which means that the string becomes the i know how to add 1 and and the output of that statement is	
	
would probably introduce a method for the class and perhaps a extension method for various collections of the this method would simply go through and reference all the getters on the public properties of the class to ensure that they are you would invoke before sending the to your flex you might even want to make this an interface so that you can test for the need for finalization before transfering your objects and invoke the method based on a test for the interface rather than checking for each class finalize is just the first name that popped into there may be a better name for

would recommend doing asynchronous a little bit easier to set up and require you to create new threads programming is where you for a file stream you want to write to but does not want to wait for it to you might want to be notified when finished but you want to you do is using the and functions that are available on the stream your method you start by calling beginwrite with all the data you want to write and also pass in a callback this function will be called when beginwrite has the callback function you call endwrite and clean up the stream and check for will not block which means that if called from within an event handler that thread can finish that handler and continue processing more event as other gui private static filestream static void stream new const string mystring asciiencoding encoding new data sleeping 5 public static void sleeping is pretty important because the thread writing stuff will be killed if the main thread is killed this is not an issue in a gui only here in this small has a good on how to write this and also some on asynch programming in general in case you go for the or

would require spoofing a ip address in requests to your local instance of i think probably spend less time just making a demo build than trying to make that	
	
would rethink your design you implemented the processing in a base you could subclass it with 2 alternatives that would be nearly first could be like where it takes an operation that returns a would rework this to use instead of having your own delegate second could just take a simple action and not provide a return both could use the same but provide a different way of you could also pass this off to other methods using the base which would provide a lot of this you could call this void int return var actionwindow new var funcwindow new int result would look something abstract partial class operatingwindowbase public void call asyncronously so you can protected abstract void class public t result private public protected override class action public protected override	
	
would say definately would look ping commands between the two servers and see if there are any the servers are next to each other you should have 1 on the could be network traffic network cards not being configured for or other things some analysis on some queries and see if you can identify indexes or locking which might be a problem if any of the selects on the read database might be blocking the with and see if this makes a difference on one or two queries you have a complicated system which you have a problem you need to determine which component is the problem and fix replication is probably best if the reports selects you need to run need to be up to if they you could look at log although that would add some down time with each make sure on seperate drives so the performance is

would say the biggest danger is if the parameter were set to inside the function for some void customer random person not just a been erased from existence long as whoever is developing this application understands object references are passed by the object references are passed by the code works as expected now and your developers understand the probably not worth the effort going to take remove them	
	
would say your answer depends on the sure that adobe air does not automatically have root access on os so it would not be able to write and execute in cases where whatever owner started the air app did not have the right permissions for accessing a in you probably have the same privileges any other program running on the computer might have that was installed by the same information	
	
would say your very best bet is to sign up for a db class at a local you can usually find an evening you will start with simple database concepts like what is a and what are instructor will usually give you a project as homework about halfway though the class where you will design and implement a simple database for something like a video you will have interaction with other students who are at your same level and will be interested in discussing the technical details from a new db guy and you will have an experienced instructor you can ask questions of and get timely interaction who be snarky like us internet posters

would seem like the perfect solution for a kiosk type assumedly the kiosk machines are going to need have minimal maintenance done to them and the web deployment approach for apps is the best most mature one big advantage of using silverlight is that if you have any business logic in type languages that needs to run client side it can usually be easily ported to compile against the silverlight runtime you may not even need to change a single line depending on which framework libraries you the only thing that could limit the viability of using a browser based app in this situation is if you have some additional hardware access requirements such as a custom ticket credit card reader in those cases be fighting the browser sandbox to get them to	
	
would seem to be the sort of thing for which a hashtable would be storage and retrieval of hashtable entries is possible in and can be used quite effectively i would recommend trying something like the following a is effectively a generic available from this will be used to keep track of the occurrences of each keywords value will act as a bit each text file and read all the setting the appropiate bit for the corresponding text file in which the keyword is would vary from 0 to 3 in your over all entries in the looking for the appropiate value in your because you are looking for a keyword that appears in the files but the last the value you want to search for is 0011 3 in find this entry and you have your this algorithm runs in where n is the total number of keywords in all your text i think going to get better than that let me know if you need a few more i seemed to have missed the bit about your possibly containing more than one actual if these are known to be shorted than a certain number of then i think this solution may still be viable with small need something a bit more it would

would strongly suggest using it is or recommended by can be very difficult to write a regular expression that works in all are some cases have to comment void comments can be foo void match signatures in strings underscores are but void identifier override void have to recognize defaults to explicit more comments signatures can span void void string forget the int approach will throw away everything that it so you will in fact lose all the that you are splitting forget that signatures can have commas in can be your current regexp could consume more than it is a lot of other stuff that can show up in so just because something is between two method signatures does not make it part of a method

would suggest the datetime field rather than the autoincrement simply because it will not only serve as an effective sort it also preserves information that you may well want to if you want the most recent first sort using the date and a order by you retrieve the you can retrieve it as a datetime and modify it using you can use as suggested by mdresser if you just wish to show the date or if you wish to show the time as you can also use sql to convert it into a string before retrieving you look in see the various conversion codes is the code used that can be used to translate the date in various you may want to use an autoincrementing field for your application for reasons other than your expressed need to sort wall they are easy to use just mark the field as an if using sql server dbs are as far as using them in your just think of the field as an int field that you never have to why would you use a perhaps the most straightforward reason is so that they give you have an easy way to identify each for if you permit people to alter or delete their wall the field is ideal as it gives you a way to easily look up each record record will be assigned its unique you might put an next to the record like stackoverflow does and make it a call back with the uid note that you should set up your primary key on the uid field if be doing you find them useful for this then you could also sort by the i would still store the date so that you can provide date and time feedback as to when an entry was made on the wall but this would no longer be your indexed or sorted

would suggest using nmap nmap at appears to be appears to be 11 ip addresses hosts scanned in if you want to write it yourself is fair this is how i would do ip in do ping 1 echo is an explanation of each bit of the above list of ip can use the syntax to generate a list of for echo 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 also useful for things like which makes and each containing and to generate a list of do something echo loop over something in you use for thingy in 1 2 do echo to the ping command varies a bit with different different using os x default on the os x version of it will ping until which going to work for so will only try sending one which should be enough to determine if a machine is problem is the timeout which seems to be 11 seconds on this version of changed using the one second should be enough to see if a machine on the local network is alive or the ping command use ping 1 1 56 data ping statistics packets 0 packets packet ping we need to know if the machine replied or can use the operator to run a command if the first for echo echo nonexistantcommand echo should not command not so we can 1 1 echo is other way would be to use the exit code from the ping command will exit with 0 if it and a code if it in bash you get the last commands exit code with the variable to check if the command 1 1 0 echo is echo is ping we need to see the ping so we can redirect to with the for ping 1 1 echo is is to redirect discard the host is you use for command not errorcausingcommand to combine all ip in do for loop and the ping 1 1 ping and discard if 0 then check the exit echo is display the you could send this to a log file by using the echo is using the in a ip in do ping 1 1 echo is each ping command takes about 1 second we set the timeout flag to 1 it can only run one ping command at a the obvious way around this is to use so you can run concurrent but beyond what you should use bash threads a first explains how to use the python threading module to write a although at that i would once again suggest using

writing a dsp application in a multitrack been profiling it for quite some time on different machines and noticed some my home the first run of the playback loop takes up about of the available assume due to the jit doing its then for the subsequent loops it goes down to a steady the problem if i run the application on a slower the first run takes up more than the available causing the playback to get interrupted and messing the output which is after it goes down to a after the first the application keeps calling some routines from time to time 2 seconds more or which causes the steady consumption to experience very short peaks of noticed that if i let the application run for a while these peaks will also go down to a not sure if due to the jit recompiling these portions of i have a serious problem with the while the application will behave nicely even in very slow these are going to be a big trying to figure out how to resolve this issue and come up with an which is to mark all the routines with an attribute that will tell the application to them beforehand during so be fully optimized when really but this is only an idea i like it too much and i wonder if a better solution to the whole like to hear what you guys the application is not an i like and want all the jit optimizations i can consumption and garbage collection kicks are not an using object pools and the maximum peak of memory during playback is 304 the jit compiler to generate the most optimized code during application

xp your maximum program address space is then you have fragmentation due to and drivers loading up in to your address you have the problem of your heap best move is just to get it over with and run as a process a suddenly all these problems go you can use a better heap to mitigate heap fragmentation and you can try using virtualalloc to grab your memory in one big contiguous chunk then you get to manage it from to discourage from fragmenting you can split your bsp across complicated and and frankly just putting it on disk would be but in theory you could get better performance by having a group of processes exchanging if you can keep everything resident assuming you can be smarter than memory than the os can handle file which is a big each process would need far less memory and therefore run in to the 2gb address space of burn through a lot can mitigate the effects of fragmentation of the address space by allocating smaller this will have other nasty side but you could follow a backoff policy where you grab smaller and smaller chunks of memory if you fail to successfully frequently this simple approach will get you a program that works when it otherwise but the rest of the time performs as well as it computing just sound so much nicer than the other

year our company holds a where participants can show their have a which let the participants sign up for the can enter information such as the name of their billing and so seems as if the requirements for what information the participants need to vary from year to one year the participants might need to enter the size of the stand they the next year this is no longer and so you might just have to enter a total number of you while the next you might need to add the height and number of floors you they this has caused the db schema to become quite now have a lot of fields and tables in our and beginning to look quite historical we just reset the schema back to basics for each might need some of the data from the old does anyone have a good idea on how we can deal with this only solutions i can think of are our database for each conference all of the information as xml anyone has some good litterature for how to handle evolving databases and dealing with obsolete it would be good schema changes needed which strategy should be	
	
years ago a school i implemented in c a mapping other which took an existing and then by creating a much more memory and representation a graph was stored as an optimized we saw amazing performance java supports implementing something like this can be a lot easier in fact but not familiar with an	
	
years ago i picked up the job to provide support to a project that ran real on a z80 and was in assembly there any other way to do the original author was a nigerian guy by the name of maybe i should just scattered throughout the code was a me awhile to figure out what this the instruction itself does nothing clear the a slick although not sure if there is an or you can just a byte or what is does is exclusive or the accumulator with result of always to the mt empty the best run	
	
years of seeing perl code written by c some generic use use use use list operations especially for small use fancy list shift and unshift are use hashes are hashes are make use them and throw them use the iterator for not the call things use a list call things use a hash use use if you have to type use a not or love use the modifier to make them if when you want a almost always a better way to write a nested try try a try a variables when you need not at the top of the use use and fix them use write write use use probably already done run it with just for run think about why you do change your the time not spent fighting the language and debugging memory allocation to improve your take style commentary on your code go to a perl mongers go onto go to yapc or a perl your perl knowledge will grow by leaps and	
	
yegge had a very interesting blog post that covered these universal design	
	
yes i asked this question that there was a clear consensus that most not of the significant differences were dom not syntax

you are trying to do it implies user so what if no client enters into your example servlets and ejb containers can do it programmatically at container startup what you so i suppose that for php the only way to accomplish cronlike jobs is to make some changes in your apache source obviously only if you are using an housing more praticable option not contempling code changes could be some cron script calling directly your page launched during your web server

you are using exception handlers for control you are being too general and as someone else you know something happened if you are handling processing in the but what essentially you are using the exception for an else if you are using it for control you know what possible state could then you can use an exception handler for unexpected for example when you have to use a or you have to catch everything in the ui to show a nice error message and log the if you do know what might go and you put an if statement or something to check for then you are just being allowing the exception handler to be the for stuff you know could happen is and it will come back to haunt you because you will be trying to fix a situation in your exception handler based on a possibly false you put logic in your exception handler to determine what exactly then you would be quite stupid for not putting that logic inside the try handlers are the last for when you run out of to stop something from going or things are beyond your ability to the server is down and times out and you prevent that exception from being having all the checks done up front shows what you know or expect will occur and makes it code should be clear in what would you rather	
	
you are using i would strongly suggest that you take a look at it provides nice platform independent access to interprocess where most of the tedious and error prone low level details are shielded from

you call that deluding still a programming just one that tries to mimic natural language and i suspect that it will fail once you get into implementation in order to make in have to put restrictions on the syntax that will confuse the users been led to think that writing advantage of a dsl is should at any is that simple and yet powerful in regard to the problem mimicking a natural language is a secondary and may in fact be to those primary someone is too stupid or lacks the ability for formally rigorous thinking required for then a programming language that mimicks a natural one will not magically turn them into a cobol was some people seriously believed that within 10 years there would be zero demand for professional since cobol was and anyone who needed software could write it and we all know how been working	
	
you can assume that there is some constraints regarding the then you might be able to get away with knowing less for if your shape was the composition of a small square with a long thin triangle on one side a simple symmetrical then you could compare the distance from each list point to the of the largest distance would identify the tip of the the second largest would be the two points farthest from the tip of the if there was some order to the like points are entered in counter clockwise order the you could identify all the this sounds like a bit of so it might be reasonable to try to include some extra info with your like the of and a reference point that is located above the com not along the this will give you an vector that you can cross with the normal to define some body for the normal can be defined by an ordering of the point if you assume anything about the shapes even if the shapes were for then you will need more it depends on your	
	
you can best fragement depends on the file concurrently open a large number of opening a file will create a new directory entry but cause a block to be written for that but now go through each file in writing one this typically will cause the next free block to be which will lead to all your files being fragmented with regard to each files is another do the but do it on a file copy of existing doing a delete of the original and rename of	
	
you can bypass but the question is if you really want you want to use you better use them so as you have experienced you get problems if you mix class and interface databasesettings in some do something with now have a second reference to the interface and losing the first will not free the as also possible to keep both the class and the databasesettingsint sure to set the interface right after the object has been you really want to disable reference you just have to create a new descendant of tobject that implements i have tested the example below in d2009 and it query interface can stay the same because it does not depend on reference out if result result frefcount if self nil if 0 result result if result 0 just lowers the refcount just like you can use it where you normally use	
	
you can change the signature of your then try changing it const char const int int will result in a more reusable and more efficient added const qualifiers will make sure you mistakenly alter the input this function is a so i assume it is never meant to have suffix to compare against is passed in as a so you can save this function for later reuse with other signature will give you the opportunity to pass the lengths of the strings in if you already know we call this can define the function like const char const int int str suffix return str suffix return lenstr 0 lenstr lensuf 0 lensuf return lenstr obvious for the extra parameters is that they imply more noise in the or a less expressive

you can do this with criteria queries by using simply project only the properties you wish to use and only those will be included in the select clause of the compiled to are several ways to accomplish with some limitations the nhibernate list assign the property name as an alias to your projection and the aliastobean transformer will map those projections to an actual the limitation to this method is that any properties that you map must have a setter in the poco this can be a protected setter but it must have a can also do this with linq as well in an a slightly different list new id is simply using linq to map the indexed list that is ouput into a new instance of the task the same limitation as above applies except that this is a bit more severe in that all the properties mapped must have a public setter because that is what linq uses to do fill in the hope this helps	
	
you can do want you but may have to eschew javascript and instead leverage it is about the ability to send between two	
	
you can do with an app that has very variable heap requirements is to set your max heap size very high with and tune and so that the app will not hang on to a lot of memory when the heap shrinks does that with default note that this may cause performance problems when the memory actually used by the app varies both strongly and quickly in that case better off having it hang on to all the memory rather than give it back to the os only to claim it again a second you might also want to fiddle with the to ensure that the gc leave too much unclaimed objects lying which it tends to do when a lot of room for the heap to and which would defeat the goal of wanting the heap size to adjust to the	
	
you can get hold of the for the site then in the section of the do something like ex as new g as new will get every error of the application and send you all the details you need to create that that just sends you an email with the could do it alot better than this but typing this directly into this

you can implicitly cast a to a you do the same for a function pointer with those types a the compiler is more careful with type matching on function to mention that happening inside qsort would be the that a would be cast to a in numcmp and const in the compiler should issue a warning in these if you really have to use a function that have the same types as perhaps you should use a wrapper function that does match the and then does the appropriate explicit cast when calling the original int return int return the modern signature for qsort int void const void issue of seem to come into play in your but did not have

you cannot use lambda expressions in the watch locals immediate as marc has pointed out this is incredibly i wanted to dive a bit further into the topic most people consider with executing an anonymous function in the debugger is that it does not occur in a the very act of definining and running an anonymous function changes the underlying structure of the code changing the in and in particular from the immediate is a very difficult the following var v1 var v2 func1 var v3 v1 particular code creates a single closure to capture the value closure capture is required whenever an anonymous function uses a variable declared outside for all intents and purposes v1 no longer exists in this the last line actually looks more like the v3 the function example is run in the debugger it will stop at the break now imagine if the user typed the following into the watch order to properly execute this the debugger more appropriatel the would need to create a closure for variable this is difficult but not impossible to really makes this a tough job for the ee though is that last how should that line now be for all intents and purposes the anonymous function deleted the v2 variable and replaced it with so the last line of code really now needs to v3 to actually get this effect in code requires the ee to change the last line of code which is actually an enc while this specific example is a good portion of the scenarios are even worse is executing that lambda expression be creating a new it should actually be appending data to the original at this point you run straight on into the limitations small example unfortunately only scratches the surface of the problems we run i keep saying write a full blog post on this subject and hopefully have time this

you care about the manifest and other meta information you probably since you just want to extract you can just extract the files with delete the and create a new you care about the meta take a look at signing and for a description of what signing you should be able to the jar by editing the manifest and deleting the signature file in the above might answer your but they might not solve your because i am not sure how having a signed jar would result in being the resources themselves are unaffected by the signing if you just extract resources via the jar command itself in the second paragraph do you still have

you compare this to hoe java deals with events on a gui component exactly the but the same general you wind up with something void void void void of the things are you then provide one or more classes that implement the interfaces prefer one class per listener others prefer to make a ingle class that implements all of the proves to be very flexible because things can register only for the events that they are interested alternative is a single method where the listener interface has every single possible event in that would be a bad idea unless you are ok with things being notified about events that they do not care do you anticipate wanting fine grained control over what you can listen if so the java model works well ok if you care about it it is very if you think that everything will want to be notified of all events then the single way works sounds like you want fine grained so be fine with doing it the java event way of an interface for each general category of

you developers please give us a good description of what raii why it is and whether or not it might have any relevance to other know a little i believe it stands for acquisition is that name jive with my understanding of what raii i get the impression that raii is a way of initializing objects on the stack such when those variables go out of the destructors will automatically be called causing the resources to be cleaned why that called the stack to trigger how do you get from there to how can you make something on the stack that will cause the cleanup of something that lives on the are there cases where you use do you ever find yourself wishing for garbage at least a garbage collector you could use for some objects while letting others be the meaning of the term and the concept raii acquisition is

you ever been frustrated by visual studio not certain watch expressions when stepping through code with the have and does anyone here care about pure methods with no so many great things about that i but i write pure that static methods with no if you were to build your own compiler where you could write something like int somereftype int int return only is the above a free i call it a the function is assured to not have any the keyword could here be used to indicate just and provide a contract for pure these kind of functions can always be without causing side this being a way for visual studio to always evaulate my functions in the despite the faulty assumpation that all method calls and user operators have side a method where all the parameters are copy by value can never have side visual studio fails to recognize love for what you can do at and i miss these things in i think is dumbing down on the user a bit and basically not allowing certain hurting many things which actually relate what you can do at compile like to actually see more meta programs which are programs run by the compiler to compiler your original while has booleans and allow things like a obj as it generate the approriate i did some digging around and noticed how fails to generate approriate il for branchless for example y 1 an il instruction for just that which the compiler you or be instrested in an which looks like but is something entierly more and more and totally in terms what you can do with of methods in evaulation and custom

you follow the steps to define an instrumentation class the which involve specifing a slightly different set of attributes in the of you must specify a attribute that gives the full of the class that implements in your your agent uses any then you should specify the since your instrumentation agent will need its libraries to be visible from the bootstrap if you do you will probably have to use the wacky argument to the the argument is a decent way to get things but you want to use this attribute in the because the is already growing from having to specify the java instrumentation might as well keep it as simple as there is the if it is set to then the java instrumentation agent is able to redefine the classes that the agent itself this is a pretty odd and certainly arise got that was using to print the class is when it is loaded first bottom line is if there is exception in transform will be eaten

you have a bunch of electrons being passed around among various atoms inside of your because of the structure of the silicon atoms in your the electrons follow certain which determine the branch of execution the computer will seems i should explain a little less bear with i majored in computer not electrical so i have a very deep understanding of these cpu is made of a a usually which is called a one of the great things about semiconductors is that their elecrical properties can be easily varied through or applying impurities that create areas of negative or positive on the the lines where these areas come together are known as and electricity flows much more easily one way across these junctions than the this property is exploited to create which allow electricity to flow only in one and which can be thought of as tiny switches that allow one electrical current to control another electrical these transistors and diodes are combined in a myriad of ways to create the logic gates of your of the logic gates inside of your cpu are dedicated to being the which is in charge of retrieving and decoding telling the rest of the cpu what to and finally getting the next on the the control unit is actually running which tells it how to deal with and so you really need to be incredibly specific about a particular line of processors to get into how the x86 isa is implemented on a particular	
	
you have a circle of radius with center point lies outside of the at coordinates your question is to find the closest point on the circle itself to the point solution is the closest projection of a point onto a circle is accomplished by a simple x0 y0 new point will lie on the circle to be you would be better off to work in polar with the origin at the center of the then everything gets much next question will be where did it hit on the forget the points of the compass on the circle are rotating with an atan2 function will give you the angle that the point lies most toolsets will have that see that subtracted off the origin

you have a limited set of regexes to match against you could create a table with the primary key of your table and a field indicating if it matches that which you would update on a trigger and then index your tables key in that this trades a small decrease in update and insert speed for a probably large speed increase in you could write a function which compares your field to that regex even pass the regex along with the field you are matching to the then create a functional index on your table against that this also assumes a fixed set of regexes you can add new regex matches more easily this the regex is dynamically created from user input you might have to live with the table scan or change the user app to produce a more simple search like like which would use an index on field	
	
you have a list collection containing many items to show in a take the following example that iterates through the list inspection in listviewitem item new code produces the following output in the listview course depending how many items you have in the list the first column is a listviewitem containing many subitems it may seem strange but listview is very you could even build a file explorer with

you have classes representing tables in a simplified would have a class and a class instances are representing rows of the respective and company would inherit from some base abstract say that will have some common methods like etc you want to store data about the validation and the table the best place would be in a static variable in each derived class since the validation and table definition is the same for each instance of lsb the mentioned method in baseobject would have no reference to the static variables defined in user and even though you are calling it through an instance of it will look for the same static variable in the baseobject and it will raise an is my experience with php lsb is going to be introduced in

you have the data you even need to look at the an array from m is the number of over the polygons and increment the array entry of each vertex gives you an array that describes how many times each vertex is can then do another pass over the polygons and check the entry for each if 1 you know that vertex is shared by another can build upon this strategy further if you need to other for example instead of a count you could store polygons directly in the array allowing you to get a list of all faces that use a given vertex at this point effectively creating a map where vertex indices are the example assumes you have no degenerate but those could easily be

you just always include the review comment form and use client side code to show or hide considering no additional data is required for the review page beyond that of which already needed on the index a round trip to a controller is not this would allow you to delete the review action and	
	
you just comment out the mappings until you really need them hibernate needs a complete of the provided entities and create just for some of	
	
you just define a simple class with two real result and expected result and then loop over the collection in a similar way to what your python snippet is	
	
you just rewrite the colx into from where is or	
	
you just seem to be able to decide on one or the assume they both offer the feature set your in which case django would have 1 more reason being it still highly depends on your experience with open source solutions and how much you understand or appreciate the	
	
you just testing this inner or are you testing your undisclosed outer loop as if look at these three it looks like is the counter for the outer so by sometimes doing an extra increment of the value you get to skip some of the iterations in the outer thereby reducing the total amount of work the code needs to	
	
you just use problem with your is that while theoretically this should reality postgresql cannot that t is separator and hh24 is next and prints it you can change it relatively simply outputs requested course remembering always to use translate gets old pretty so instead you can create your own function and use it function returns text as select language select	
	
you just use the relative just looked at some plugins i have installed and they use the same syntax you you double check your the file you positive you can embed a it would be ridiculous if you but worth double all i see being used are	
	
you just want to be a and write you need to take you want to learn computer science and appreciate and really become a computer you take is a microcosm of computer it contains every single including not limited ai algorithms heuristic theory get to see a lot of computer science come together in an amazing not only will you understand more about why programming languages work the way that they but you will become a better coder for having that you will learn to understand the low which helps at the high we very often like to talk about things being a but things are a lot smoother when you understand a little bit about in the even if you build a whole you will surely learn a you will get to see the formalisms behind parsing realize not just a bunch of special cases hacked and a bunch of np complete you will see why the theory of computer science is so important to understand for practical compilers are extremely and we have the compilers we have today without really hope you consider learning about it will help you get to the next level as a computer scientist	
	
you just want to know about logarithmic big be on the lookout for when your data is cut in half each step of the is because if you are processing data that is as big as the step before it is an infinite	
	
you just want to mention that a function affects global then a simple prefix might if you want to mention every single that it using the function header is probably the way to like for function description parameters param1 param2 param3 return value and global variables global1 global2 global3	
	
you just write unit tests for your do you know if there are some other developers having the same probably they will follow your example and write unit think that the problem is the technique or the costs for an integration the problem is the attitude to unit so convince them with all are lots of hints in this thread try	
	
you kill the the operating system will clean up the memory of the but no gc inside the runtime will occure and no finalizers will above was correct only if you kill the not if you use you send then it will send the appropriate window message to the program and will terminate the process at once and can shut down another you stop it is roughly equivilent to which will shut down the process at

you know final builder is an outstanding build automation i want to use to automate moving the image after the build of web this will ease so much the work for me instead of copying the file yet how can i create a shortcut in visual studio so when i click it it will run the final build building think with this combination life will be much much easier and i will not have to go back and forth to do how can i do that in the build action of web deployment project from final	
	
you know how can i make splint ignore where i declare my know that the old school c tells you to declare variables right at the in every since i am a bad person i like to declare things close to where i use good example is to put int right before the take a very simple splint int return splint and most old c compilers would like to move int up one to put round the declaration and the for now to the how do i turn off this keep the other checks that is i already use gcc as a first line off valgrind as the thinking about adding splint to my list of things that could control my stupidity this check is just gcc warnings i know about the potential portability problems that could come from that bad i feel that it increases aka not needing to jump up and down to search for this type off declarations is more valuable this we can discuss in another little more i put the above code in a file called used is ubuntu and gvim as this is the output from splint when i run 03 nov setting redundant with current parse help on parse see splint this opens up 2 more questions that i did not think about with current what current is it a parse error and not a is a posibility to patch splint to support this have not tried this but yet but i think that it is the can i make splint ignore where i declare my

you know the structure of your excel document presuming you want and kind of complex etc within the excel you can generate xml using the excel xml not referring to referring to the xml format used by excel prior to cover how to do it problem with interop is that it really designed to hard core document if you try and do a lot of document processing you can run into	
	
you launch a new process using processstartinfo the process is started in the same window station and desktop as the launching if you are using different credentials then the user in not have sufficient rights to run in that the failure to initialize errors are caused when attempts to initialize in the new process and get around this you must first retrieve the security descriptors associated with the window station and desktop and add the appropriate permissions to the dacl for your then launch your process under the new a detailed description on how to do this and sample code was a little long for here so i put together an with following security adjustments are necessary to give the new sufficient permission to run in the window this uses classes from the asprolock library also from intptr hwinsta windowstationsecurity ws new intptr hdesk desktopsecurity ds new using process	
	
you locked into a rdbms then a database like couchdb or amazons simpledb might be something to look what you are describing is trivial in a couchdb this probably really answer you specific question but sometimes good to look at radically different	
	
you look at the query output before grouping then see the multiple rows will be returned for a user if they have more than 1 record in any of the joined so if a user has 2 comment records then 2 point records will also be a simplified table name table points table comment here from these tables will result points 10 10 not entirely sure of the mysql syntax but you would want something join as from group by as on userid join as from group by as on userid	
	
you looked at the i believe even one of its examples takes you through how to setup an server with if this for a real i would not recommend trying to come up with your own implementation from you will want to use a library to accomplish this so you are using one thread per rather a thread	
	
you looked at the server migration assistant for by step document on how to use	
	
you looked at using it has a recorder to record your keystrokes and mouse which you can then dump into a script and you can also reference certain windows that present and preform special actions against such as hiding them just about anything you they also have a great community forum see	
	
you looked into using a properties file commons should be and it intelligently handles where the properties files should way you only have one build but the configuration files are operating system should be considerably less to and	
	
you looking for edge table based you can take a look at the wikipedia entry for or search the directory for the algorithms but some code as	
	
you looks for a directive in the the directive must start with and contain this will be assumed to be the correct python interpreter use to run the script on if no interpreter found then the script will be run with whatever one is found on the for in a script which is saved as and runs on linux and windows and uses the python when run on linux uses the when on windows using it uses to set up the association add this to the itself works with either and this entry has been added python files can be run on commandline and the use of will be if script args if interpreter default to wherever it is found on the lines for line in if and interpreter process just knocked this up on reading this thread what i was needing i have pythons and on both ubuntu and if it work for you post fixes

you may also your if you are not willing to pay for special	
	
you may consider turning to is web toolkit believe it supports all the browsers you are interested and gives you the ability to code your ui in a ide such as the advantage of this is you can use ide tools for code completion and error which greatly improves development on ui you use gwt ui it will hide a lot of nastiness from having to be dealt but when you will create a deploy file for each browser this way you never download any code if you are viewing the app in you will also have a stub generated which will load the appropriate compiled bundle of to sweeten the these files are so perceived performance is generally improved for returning	
	
you mean a program that can translate complicated declarations to english and explain int foo as pointer to function returning pointer to function returning is avaible online at

you mean something like navigating by selecting an item of a you could do the form configured with a that points directly to the target js is have the be called when selecting the if no js is a button should be allowing the user to still work with the the approach above goes directly to the target this is different than sending a redirect from the which incurs in an extra request to be adds extra delay to the operation and more requests to be handled by the this is a navigate there is no need to go server side for this least not without additional specific	
	
you mean something like the following code	
	
you mean the anchored view should appear transparent over the or just anchored view uses top of the available table view uses the any create a uiview containing the anchored view and the table if you want the anchored view transparent over the table a bit because to scroll the table touches have to pass through the anchored the surrounding view controller to the navigation controller instead of just the	
	
you mean the programming you currently do the currently released d compilers compile to native not managed a port is in and this infoq which may be of interest for more existing has other information and	
	
you mean to use and to refer to the same stepping out on a limb because i have a ton of experience with but do this the same way that do it in or by copying the remaining array elements down into their new that is sorted its contents are valid indices for the code would be something like the untested code bother copying any elements below the first selected writeindex readindex selectionindex if if the read pointer is currently at a selected then bump it up until past selected readindex remove the tail of the your remove algorithm still suffers from the flaw that as you remove items in you break the correspondence between the indices in and those in see try adding 3 then doing and then hit it will start by removing the 1st file in the list now what the 2nd and 3rd files in the list are at indices 0 and the next value taken from is 1 but what had been the file is at index so the former file gets spliced out of the leaving the former 2nd file and at index more see that this implementation only removes every other file in the is why my javascript code uses a and a to copy the entries in the skipping the over the indices that are to be this algorithm avoids the problem of losing correspondence between the array does need to be coded carefully to guard against various edge i tried some javascript code what i wrote it worked for suspect that the problem in your original test case the 2nd then adding is since only shown part of your i tell whether the array indices and the data in and are always going to match up i suspect that the problem is that they even if you fix the problem with using by adjusting the array index values still an algorithm in the general the array copy algorithm is	
	
you mention suggests you want to capture a hexadecimal in that case i is the list of all hexadecimal number in posix	
	
you mentioned template and you may be interested in this cloning vs setting of option is to use a dom such as class1 if each item is going to need the same structure created i would go with the cloning if any logic involved in creating the structure into which the content will rather maintain something like the above than fiddling about with if that approach turned out to be too fall back to	
	
you mess with i suggest that you make sure that in fact have a problem with simultaneous quite often find that messing with the data like this has unintended and be moderately surprised if the problem really is appears to me that seeing proposals that will set all the rows to the same offset you have an integer surrogate and the rows are you could set mydate interval id where id between and	
	
you might explicitly set and this does control which jdk version of the javac compiler you are on the workstation with pointing to jdk you have class files built on a javac which should be compatible with a the and only specify the compatibility of the if you are relying on some classes available only in the then you will not get any compiler warning here when using and on a address this last you need to tell the ant task to use a different

you need to fake an anchor from the thickbox can be invoked from a link input element a and the area element that is acceptable it should be as easy as putting the thickbox class on the input i would recommend using firebug and placing a breakpoint in the onclick method of the anchor element to see if only triggered on the first i had to try it for myself and for me pretty much exactly your code worked in both chrome and window pop ups no matter if i click the input or the anchor if the above code works for i suggest your error lies elsewhere and that you try to isolate the possibly is that we are using different versions of i am using what i got from the thickbox page jquery and thickbox

you need to just open it in and the server need to be why not use a long uris over the network is basically never the right thing to as you some web hosts support long some proxy servers may also choke on long which means that your app might not work for users who are behind those if you ever need to port your app to a different other browsers may not support uris that you need to get data up to a use a an extra round but it will be much more if you are uploading data to the server using a get then you are vulnerable to all kinds of request an attacker can trick the user into goatse to their account simply by getting them to click on a link hidden by or another url shortening or just embedded as a link in a web page when they look closely at the url clicking should never use get for sending data to the beyond query parameters that actually change anything on the

you point me to best practices for file hosting in iis the number of files can be very high possible concern is the performance with such a large number of we could have a smaller number of larger files and have a http handler to process the requests or just have the smaller files and use iis7 to directly serve them as static there any best comparisons that you can what do you multiple files versus few larger files hosted by iis7 windows server

you probably have access to cron either what i would do is check how much time has passed everytime someone loads a if 24 hours have passed then call your update if 48 hours have passed then call it if no one loads the page then it matter if the update function has been called or not because no one is looking you could setup a computer at home to call your remotely every 24 you can do that with a cron job and wget or if using windows you could use the task think the first option will work the call your update function every page load and only update when the 24 hour mark has if you write it correctly it matter if it gets updated at the exact 24 hour	
	
you probably want to use instead of problem is the inner join if no ratings where submitted for a joke then that joke would not be returned as only jokes with a rating value match the inner would recommend using a left join or even a while i normally prefer as they are usually i would have tried something like id as as select as avgrating from where and group by as jokecategory by by

you release software builds to do you prefer to always use the or do you sometimes use the debug my like to use asserts to trap for conditions that should never the one it might be useful for to test our software with the assertions so that if they can create a scenario that triggers an they can report it to the other there is always the risk that a developer has coded an assertion in a way such that it changes the behavior of the in that should be testing the a build with assertions we have always had operating on our relesae as that was the code that would i am thinking about trying a pattern where our really early releases to would go out with assertions then as we get closer to we will notify them that their builds have assertions do you guys release builds vs debug and	
	
you remove the file from version how does a developer new to the project the one who accidentally deleted his local get it after initial what if there are additions to the settings would suggest the keep a default settings file no connection in name it something like and let the code work with a copy of named every developer has to make this copy and can then work with her personalized if there are add them to everyone else will get them with a update and can merge then into her personalized

you should always strive to defend the implementation from the you make an attribute you are letting the client know how your implementation for that attribute binds you in keeping not only the but also the you can perform other smart things like access if you use a if you make an attribute you have much less control of what the client can do with that

you should be using webdeployment projects as this will do a lot more compilation and checking of your code and see for more have 4 environments setup dv py pp pd all matching branches in each of these has also has an entry in the sln configuration manager where you can setup what projects are required to be build and the build that is setup correctly you can then start setting up deployment i prefer use msbuild to deploy as it will give you a lot more approach to msbuild is a bit strange to start with however once you get the hang of it quite deployment script which is added to the teambuild config is basically as you can see i do a bit of cleanup before i copy to the live i also use 2 msbuild frameworks at the tasks release tasks suite release to files in to to files that were removed were you will need to modify to your system also it clears down the target folder before it starts to copy the new build this is to make sure they system is clean but obviously you will need to add anything that you need to keep to the excludedfiles also have a folder for each environment in the main application this holds the replacements feature of webdeployment and any other environement specifc will be a long process to get it working correctly but hopefully this will get you if you choose this

you should define a distance between two you just have to verify for each pixel that distance to your color is small	
	
you should in this is use the xmlconvert class and its members to convert the value like it exists in the xml file to a regular	
	
you should just have one primary filegroup and one log file against when you have very static you can create a filegroup that contains this static you can then make the filegroup which improves your after this is pretty static not worth it if you have a low number of readonly rows lookup table but for some stuff archived content that can still be read then this might be a great got the idea from blog	
	
you should know the following about to calculate the x and y element offset for the positioned div for browsers safari of the browser has different model for this particular is closure and how to create to create onload event in the browsers listed an example of the code where you have pure html code like javascript code that add special handlers in automatic mode for a tag using you get acquainted with this you may use jquery library that hide the complexity of this	
	
you should link a program containing any code with the adding the fortran and c libraries to the link the standard advice is to make the program nor since the startup sequences for are make the fortran code into a function that you call from a minimal assuming no argument handling probably

you simply do certain one example is since making a message appear on the screen by a this is why a goal of functional programming to minimize rather than eliminate them that there are often instances where minimizing conflicts with other like speed or memory other already a conceptual model of your problem that lines up well with the idea of mutating and fighting against that existing model can be wasted energy and	
	
you simply split by then the text by and trim the is it more complex	
	
you specifically ask about i assume you mean the event handlers and message handlers that you can define in the properties windows of a mfc you can for windows for child windows notification messages like for handling of a button click in a you can define message handlers for other windows also some explanation in win32 both the events handlers and and message are in fact message other answers explain the difference between windows events to the mfc described and windows messages to both and described you think that this is a bit i completely van der van der

you start refactoring you should create tests that will be able to test what going to change if you say unit tests will not be or they will be hard to then by all means create higher level tests possibly even excersising the whole of your you have code coverage tools for your language use them to measure the quality of the tests that created after reached a reasonably high value and if the tests are kept up to date and extended be able to do anything with your code very efficiently and be rather sure things are not going in the wrong	
	
you start worrying about actively modifying things for more want to check the from the one of the simplest steps you can do is to enable an opcode cache as on your server opcode cache alone can give you a

you sure the time is all could it be the function itself where the cost if this is the case simply inlining things might make the function vanish from your profiler but you see much it really is the overhead of making so many virtual calls a limit to what you can do without making things the call has for things like then often use a the checking is inlined with a with the behavior only called if void void if void void	
	
you sure you need you need to add new code when adding a new disease there is little point in making the to be data driven static will just complicate you are worried about a mismatch between the database and the you can verify that database and the constants match when starting up the you have the diseases defined in a table and are using some kind of referential integrity you do think you need a data driven you probably should not need any fields for at as the code really depend on in that case each disease should be a proper object with a identity and other you need special handling for certain types you probably should go back to an enum you instead have many diseases might be added and only a few types several diseases are handled in the same way by the same add a type in the and in the code as an enum for the and use that to run different each disease actually have a lot of it might be a good idea to try to write one class for each can then do a proper thing with and interface enum cludge is not neccesary since java as you can get both do a static import if you need when using validating the database is simpler as you get an enumeration for fields should probably be located in a class called disease or sickdude instead of a gigantic global constants for the fields in possibly as an inner public enum in the class where they

you tried opening your window via rather than seen some postings on the web about incompatibilities between and is an ie only so not recommended i know convenient because it returns a but there are various ways to simulate this the other problem with is that ie often caches the this means that if one time you calling the you do not resize then another time you then 2nd time might get your the first cached a way to get around this is to add a unique querystring at the like generated or generated based on server

you tried putting a preview image in the accordian for the time then when the user clicks on the image using javascript to replace it with the i think that would look a lot somebody selects a different pane in the accordian sure of the event to in then you could remove the replace it with an image and think then you have to worry about the flash browser interaction that is causing you	
	
you tried putting quotes around the filenames instead of	
	
you tried the it sets the appropriate http header and does persist the course this must also be supported and enabled by the remote web documentation on msdn states that it is set to by default for so i suspect the server trying to contact does not allow connection is used automatically and its settings are taken from your system internet it is also possible to override the proxy settings via property or by tweaking the application configuration file

you typically retrieve all the data for one entity id you should consider making the index just entity id and not unless you need the database to do unique effect is to make the index smaller so you get more of it in your goal should be to get the index to be in even if you need to do by date you will find that mysql can order 3650 values in a fraction of a second on the fly the this issue is the time to read the rows from your main performance issue is that the inserts result in data for one entity spread out across the disk requiring a disk access of each which will make your query run at a few hundred rows per your partitioning wont help this becaause each entity is in a single partition and the rows are spread across its on the disks will help a get efficient retrieval you need to get the data for a entity to be contiguous on which means reordering the data from the insert you can do this with mysql alter order by but it takes i have had a 182m row table doing a alter order by running for the last 2 weeks and it finished why i wrote a custom storage the not sure that you gain anything at all by partitioning unless you are partitioning across multiple servers or at least multiple the hard work that mysql has to do made any easier by all about disk access each partition on a different disk might i would not have more than twice as many partitions as you have physical 2 rather than 1 would give some queuing but i doubt that would have much i doubt you get much better than a single table using raid0 across as many disks as you performance of this application is determined by the number of disk and therefore helped if you can do more seeks per gain some processing parallelism you have multiple with partitioning but your system is going to be not processor if you get your processor utilization as high as you are probably doing something you need do something that your have been optimizing and operating this kind of application for the nine years using mysql and i have all the scars you might expect from the once your data is vastly larger than the size of your memory is my definition of the entire performance issue is which means primary the number of good	
	
you update the environment in the calling process this in a subprocess cannot modify the environment of the parent one notable exception is batch files on when run from a cmd based on the example you i guess you are not running on windows what trying to accomplish is done with a shell script that sets up the environment and then invokes your intended for you might write a script like executable and now you can run your app as you can make your script more elaborate if you like for you may want to make a parameter to the script rather than hard coding	
	
you use a const array you have to set it up with const values like of	
	
you use a plugin such as you have to worry about anything this thing called the which is where files should just because it is a bit harder mean you should put your files in the wrong and with paperclip other similar it gogo

you use autoicrement the first record will start with 1 and each record will increment from you want to sort them by newest first do an order by id would suggest making a column called wallpostid then setting that to autoincrement and also your primary you are displaying this data in a to edit columns on your grid on the date field under on the bottom on the right go to data will display as site has more info in string	
	
you use delegates as properties for have to specify the method name and then create the delegate using reflection at execution time which obviously ideal in terms of finding typos at compile be possible in il a using an equivalent to but expose any way of doing this maybe one day get the quite how it would be not would be good to keep the delegate type information in the

you use jquery might help you care what browser your user is	
	
you use the declaration and you the then copy is used when the property is your you are only accessing the value which just gives you a pointer to the sublayers a to the adc documentation on this the runtime is smart enough to know if the object being set is if an immutable object is being passed in to the property it is retained and not some if you are passing in a mutable object that you want to be able to then you should write your own setter that calls on the this is shown in the that i	
	
you use the django development or wait until version is then your filters can other fields in the your query would look like i spelled reciepients the same as you had in your although the correct spelling would be your question is when i gave the above answer i was reading your statement that you wanted all users who were in both and but then reading your code snippet it looks like you want a list of users who are but not yet in the is what you but not completely sure because of the vague requirements and i quickly test get list of now list of recipients who are not in the read will make a single but if you are using mysql it could still be efficient to do two the performance considerations	
	
you use the get parameters like you suggsted then you have to touch at your decorator can inspect and find what it avoid hardcoding template maybe you could wrap the return value from the view instead of returning the output of you could return a tuple of and let the decorator mangle the template how about something like i tested this def context if in becomes return return is a really basic but i hope it gets the idea you could modify several other things about the such as adding information to the template you could use those context variables to integrate with your site like google for a you could refactor this decorator in the future if you decide to stop using get parameters and move to something based on if you already have a lot of views and you want to modify them you could write your own version of return from import as def mimetype if in becomes return return return	
	
you use the keyboard looks like you the and not the easiest

you use this	
	
you use you can preserve the ordering in which the entries were added to the a matching entry i gather that you want to append some of its data to the original queue in this you can either update the hashed object in or use to replace the queued item with a new that this preserves the order of the original but i have not tested that your code will need to explicitly synchronize read and write access to the and the data inside you want to be updating an item in the queue at the same time that another thread is grabbing it for the easiest way to synchronize is probably by accessing the through

you want the module observed by accessing the file system itself opposed to individual is outside the scope of the c and since lua itself is the exception of the dynamic loader used to implement for c written in standard the core language lacks many file system it is easy to extend the lua core since any platform that has a file system also supports dlls or shared lua file system is a portable library that adds support for directory file attribute and the emulating some of the capability of dir in lua is essentially as simple or name in local fqn local attr produces output that looks directory directory file file your copy of lua came from for then you already have lfs and the above sample will work out of the the lua solution might also be a sensible c or the lua core is not at all provides a and is easy to interact with from c either as a hosting application or as an extension to use lfs from a c you would link with the lua initialize a lua and get the state to execute the either via or by using the c api to retrieve the function from the global push the string and call the lua function with something like which leaves the table on the top of the lua approach probably makes the most sense if you already had a need for an embedded scripting and lua meets your

you want to browse why not let your operating system do the heavy given that a modern os will already have everything it needs to mount filesystems from dvds and that there will be numerous people already using and debugging this as opposed to a smaller and more focused userbase for a userspace library such as libdvdread it seems silly not to leverage

you want to do this sort of as infrequently as because no particularly efficient way to do you specify what sort of data your site has on but going to assume something like a or a going to talk about this sort of functionality as it would be done for a but a similar approach would work for a you only want to be doing the when a page is changed submitted in the first note that there are two different ways that links have to be when a page is created or you need to search that text to determine what links should be in whenever any page is or you need to addition to the search of this page in the case of search all other pages to links as there are a few options for how to store these option is to keep two of every text in the one version is the original this is what you actually and what will be displayed if you choose to edit the the second version is the this is the data that is used to display the page to normal if your wiki markup for bold is the has and the has this makes it so that you have to process your markup on every page approach is applied to by doing a search through the submitted text to find words that should be and putting those links into the for when a page is you would step through every word in the text and compare it against a list of sure you have this list you want to be doing a database query for every this can be made fairly efficient by storing the potential linkwords as keys into a if the word being tested is in the you put a link to the relevant page around the word when you copy it into the if you just put the word exactly as it was in the are a few other options about how to implement but a fairly straightforward leave you with that for but if like to me to describe any of the other let me know in a comment and edit it	
	
you want to do with the parsed i can recommend a few java implementation of that you can use an existing sql grammar you want to actually do something with the resulting parsed i might suggest looking at an open source sql database written in	
	
you want to ensure that a posts are associated with the correct then use a form field for this at since their values can be changed by the end better to rely on the login system that you have and do something like this when the form is if is assuming that you have a perhaps in that fetches the current user via your login perhaps something also assuming that you have put in	
	
you want to follow you to the next use manual on start your pages with you normally set health when the user is just would load the health value from the previous if you set it like scripts automatically write and close so you have to worry about anything other than creating a variable in the session global just forget to start your sessions when you want to retrieve the data in the session array from the previous your will have to be able to accept you keep using hidden a player could change that information before sending it back to you more trouble to keep track are resetting your health to 50 on the 5th line of your not using the right variable name for health from the and you have any form hit the robot for robot has health else print print robot has health end if to sorry for all of the formatting is broken by this block of so i had to manually insert every in the code with this code works still have a bug of negative not writing your game for

you want to make it make sure that has length that is multiple of 4 on and checks for proper alignment 3 3 i int int is much faster than doing it byte per that this is if you want to keep the original then you obviously need to store the results in another array	
	
you want to manage different branches of the same code because as common as the code may you will want to make sweeping and one project will the not be as important as the and then you will get one branch growing faster than the insert this is more or less the industry big config limit things based on it can make the app a bit but as long as the code complains about mutually exclusive stuff and all the developers are in constant communication about new features and how they ripple throughout the entire you should do this also is the easiest to if that is a this also if you are using plugins are relatively you only have to worry about dependency if the plugins have any chance of becoming circularly interdependant a requires b requires c requires then this will quickly explode and you will revert back to best resources you have are probably the past experiences of your coworkers on different and the experience of people yammering about it on here or slashdot or certainly the of sharing change changes data is only one easier for everyone to be on the same of sharing change changes be one bug is in it affects of quicker to implement a specific feature for a specific to hack when you realize that assumption a is only applicable for markets b and not of or more of the copied projects will eventually due to a lack of cohesion in your above sweeping changes take a lot

you want to pad the you the data to be that could be another source of i suggest using test data of a complete number of blocks to eliminate this i suspect the key for the openssl api requires a not an ascii representation of the key as you have in your the paucity of the openssl ruby docs and if you speak a little you may want to prototype in jruby with the bouncycastle provider this is something that done to good effect when working with twofish present in openssl i your comment about padding the you have some confusion in your and not sure how this applies in any case since your posted key is 89 characters in perhaps you should try with a 128 bit to eliminate this padding mysql devs should be spanked for weak there are better ways to stretch passwords than by simply padding with zero bytes	
	
you want to persist the such as each campaign there really any way around accessing to write those membership is not bad on a site mil a when used for you should be wrapping calls to the membership provider in a cached and refresh often make sure to set the cacherefreshinterval on the this will force to cache the roles in a to cut down on db way to look at this is to take advice and to seperate the membership into a separate yet another great feature of the membership provider you can set a different sql connection and load it up on a different db are several other techniques around the membership provider that can really increase some quick google searches comes up a number of
