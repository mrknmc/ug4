a asp i ventured into webforms world about 5 years after having to handcode things like table in scripting it seemed like webforms would be a tremendous it is until you need even a slight bit of customization beyond alternating row colors and the you could have a gridview running with a few but customizing even what would seem like a simple thing could turn into hours of torture and also think a lot of the examples given in online are oversimplified for the effect of making webforms look sure you can get that gridview to show only 10 records of a record but do you realize that all of the records are being loaded into memory by as an example of the of rectifying that i spent a while creating a pageable gridview that only loads chunks of but it after an hour of i found that you had to delete an extra property that the ide inserts into the not fun when stupid stuff like that sets you at every it even get me started on then the clouds and mvc was handed to now that is a if you are a web you should know whats happening when someone makes a request to your the abstraction and layer of cruft that webforms put on top of that is a the most able to develop applications at the speed of php scripting and finally have total control over the what all as an additional people need to stop complaining that they are creating in mvc views when they find they have to use tags and the drag and drop your gridview onto the set all the then view the crap it gives and your not nearly done now you have to attach events and put more code in your talk about messing up the coding take a simple foreach loop

a biassed observer work for ibm on treat my comments with due your applications are written in informix you would have to do major surgery to move them to other you would need to decide which alternative interface to use your choice c as the basic is but oracle provides the oci and sybase provides the tds as with informix an upgrade to the current version clientsdk containing which more recent than the which you currently should be painless unless gone out of your way to write bad simply migrating the data might be a little traumatic not insuperably in the complexity depends on which data types you strings migrate date and time values less for but migrating the applications would require a lot of as you unless you were extraordinarily prescient and wrote a really good data abstraction upgrade to informix se would be a get the install point it at your existing probably want to recompile your programs to use the more modern but you could do that incrementally with care informixdir one for the old one for the upgrade to informix dynamic server would require you to export the data from se and import it into this would be very simple once you have ids up and getting ids up and running takes more effort than but is not all that my recommendation is to stay put with the decision is of would we have to make code changes or just is very closely related to but they are ids provides an almost strict superset of se the places i can think of where there are differences are primarily edge case has extra syntax to create table for locating files for the ids has a wholly different set of the basic create table is the same ids has types that se such as but the adornments are has create audit and drop audit and ids does not has other audit has start database and rollforward ids does not and logging in ids is main area that may cause issues is transaction ids has logged and mode as does in you are encouraged to use a logged database that would be a strong ids provides atomic statements in a logged database either the statement works as a whole or it fails as a many se applications are not written with transactions in there are some things you do when there are transactions on the such as open a cursor for update outside the scope of a this is what tends to bite code migrating from se to you cannot lock a table except in a and you cannot unlock a table except by commit or much of a problem this will be depends on what you were using in se and how the programs were designed they were designed rather than thrown an ids unlogged database and an se unlogged database are very close and you could migrate from one to the but ids can do things only when the databases are and you should aim to be using logged the migration to csdk should be just a recompile unless managed to do some really excruciatingly awful

a foreign key to a is the approach i in i use this even when i do use a database that supports enum i may skip the for the lookup and just use the actual value i need in my main table as the primary key of the lookup that way you need to do a join to get the table bugstatus status primary into bugstatus values table bugs serial primary summary status not null default foreign key references storing strings takes more space than implementation of but unless the table in question has millions of it hardly advantages of the lookup table are that you can add or remove a value from the list with a simple or whereas with you have to use to redefine the try querying the current list of permitted values in an for instance to populate a in your user a major with a lookup status from you can add other attribute columns to the lookup table if you need to to mark choices available only to in an you annotate the just simple option besides a lookup table would be to use the database supports them mysql table bugs serial primary summary status not check in this use of a constraint suffers from the same disadvantages as the hard to change the list of values without hard to query the list of permitted hard to annotate the equality comparison operator in sql is a single the double has no meaning in

a genetic when selecting members for crossover using selection does the population first need to be sorted by fitness possibilities seem to population first by ascending population by descending sort population let the roulette ball fall where it thinking that sorting either way may have no effect a pebble landing at random on a wheel containing different sized slices will have exactly the same outcome chance whether the larger slices are grouped together or but not do you need to do a sort every generation affects the speed of the algorithm so prefer not to would do a sort if using but not in this if you as i cannot find a definitive answer via google selection in genetic population needs to be sorted

a good idea to have some sort of central because allow for you to share but also have a branch somewhere that you can directly generate your your snapshots that server will probably have more than one one of which is thought of as a any previous releases will have their own and depending on the hierarchy of your team if you are divided into groups with each group working on one aspect of the then there may be team or feature based though if you work that way not because it is distributed each developer will also have their own local to make things nice and or they can each have multiple for instance a developer who likes to work while commuting may have a repository on his and another one on his with branches on his laptop that are from the ones on his up to i guess that the part makes this kind of thing a lot because you can commit and even branch while you are away from the transitioning from a then you can just slip straight into the same model as because a dvcs is flexible enough to work in the same you can just start with a single central repository with a few and it is always trivially easy to create more repositories and branches last thing is that you still need the fact that various developers each have copies of the same thing adds but it is not dvcs i use regularly is i have also tried

a great way of preventing name and takes full advantage of the existing domain name so it requires no additional bureaucracy or it is simple and reversing the domain name it also gives it a hierarchical which is so you can have on the only downside is the length of the but to me that is not a downside at i think it is a pretty good idea for any language that would support javascript libraries do for their global namespace is a big yet javascript libraries use simple global identifiers like which clash with other javascript

a second array iterate through first array and move all in the order they appear to the second iterate again and move the that are left in the same order to the second all operations this is not in situ a in situ solution is obtained by running the quicksort partitioning algorithm conducting some it seems that the known solutions without any extra memory are not there is academic research on efficient stable sorting in situ but the solutions require some extra i wonder if the original problem statement was not reproduced in an exact without stability requirement the problem is very it is also easy without in situ with both of the requirements the solution seems to be the answers here there is an algorithm that works in and is in but only if the key field is mutable and can contain an integer instead of a single this works but is not in situ stable because it is assumed that there is writable memory available per array

above answers claim on compiler optimization the code given all the documentation and experience i have had in embedded systems dsp i know for a fact that turning on optimization will increase your code size for ti dsp chip me ti tmscx6416 dsp has 9 compiler flags that will affect your code different flags for different flags for different flags for code my when you turn on optimization level three the documentation for certain functions will occur will increase code pipelining is enabled will increase code is software is where the compiler will do things in assembly that make the for loops execute significantly faster up to a couple times faster but at the cost of greater code i suggest reading about pipelining at look for loop and epilog check your documentation to make sure the optimization making your code suggestion is to look for compiler flags that relate to code you have code size compiler make sure to crank up them up to the highest usually compiling for code size means your code will execute but you may have to do boyd

added the following code to a copy of questions page existing scripts and running from scratch with one of the uncommented each time three runs of 100 var new for return new var are the results running on a virtualbox on a core 2 is much faster than copying of course it was always going to serialising a dom to text and then it from html is hard the reason dom child operations are usually slow is that them dom operations like clonenode have to do manages to do the innerhtml op amazingly but still not nearly as quickly as it does ie as a auto all round to everyone who said innerhtml would obviously be faster without considering what the question was actually jquery uses innerhtml to not because faster the ie copies events bound via attachevent using calling detachevent on clone will also remove the events from the in order to get around we use uses to implement its own event so naturally it needs to avoid that if you need you can avoid the then i think holding jquery up as the pinnacle of best practice may be a bit especially given the next adds its own arbitrary attributes to html and then needs to get rid of them when it clones them otherwise gives access to their such as through the this is ugly but then it thinks the best way to do that is processing html using regular which is the kind of basic mistake expect more from so questioners than the author of the second coming best js framework you have the string anywhere in your text if so you just mysteriously lost thanks thus ends the

adding functionality to an existing java application already been deployed there are some design decisions that i touch unless i have a compelling the app controls a pc broadcasting audio and visual to a small local tv right it mostly broadcasts static but it can also do background music at the the background music local music internet is handled by windows media current project is adding narration to the static when the narration i need to send some kind of stfu signal that temporarily either quiets or mutes the wmp so my core question the best way to accomplish know wmp has an activex but not experienced with i can probably but at this not well positioned to distinguish between solutions that are solutions that are technically feasible but and that are actually blind a solution require me to make use of a bridge like or is that am i barking up the wrong tree certainly willing to deploy small executables written in another language entirely and then access them via is this the sort of thing that visualbasic makes dirt in my skillset but if the right tool for this i just know if the right google gave me plenty of examples of incorporating wmp into a vb vb command line not so one last the wmp instance would be started by the not started by the java know if that makes a but figured it was worth thanks in advance for any insight anybody can offer controlling windows media preferably from	
adding lots of log traces all over the managed to notice that in some cases one of the properties turns into after i get app always crashed during next chart by handling the prepaint and postpaint events it has these i confirmed that the crash happens right between these two it only happens if i set the zoom before it has been painted for the first time time since the last i managed to do it in a different and it crashed am not very satisfied with this since it is obviously some internal problem which cannot be precisely detected before it actually and i may be only hiding it this but i have to leave it as it is for now because i am losing too much time the bug did a quick test where i set some properties before it is actually and application crashes i have reported the bug to software but got no this is not the first irritating bug i am having with this but for our next release switching to their managed so we will at least have reflector to find out how to resolve those thanks	
adding your own custom observable collection would be fair forget to raise appropriate events regardless whether it is used by ui for the moment or not you will have to raise property change notification for property by wpf side and bound as well as notifycollectionchangedeventargs with a set of items added did such things well as sorting support and some other and had no problems with both presentation and code behind

agree with paul that this is often solved by using a soft reference though it may evict entries earlier than you a usually acceptable solution is to use a normal cache that evicts to the soft and recovers entries on a miss if this victim caching approach works pretty giving you a lower bar but extra benefit if free memory is memory size can be determined by enabling the java and usage is pretty simple when using the sizeof utility only used this for debugging and recommend benchmarking the overhead before adopting it for normal my caching i am planning on adding the ability to plug in a evaluator once the core algorithm is this way you could store a collection as the but bound the cache by the sum of all collection i have seen unbounded collections as values in caches cause so having control is quite you really need and advise not we could enhance my current implementation to support you can email	
agree with pop it is probably best not to block in those command i think you could improve your game by thinking about the design a bit let me provide some thoughts for you on how you could possibly improve your it sounds like the problem you are describing is that you want to send a lot of move in a certain to a game component and have it execute those commands in that certain as you have there is a difference in the time it takes the computer to perform the calculations the velocity or and the time it takes the component to actually perform the action or problem with blocking during the calculations is that the update loop that is calling that function cannot update any other that may work okay if there is only one component to worry but not usually the case in most for the good how do we fix this i think erikkallen has the right but i would take it a bit it sounds like the game component is some kind of entity that will be moving so why not give it an action a simple implementation would be to just have your calling function call something queueaction function might look like void the top of your update function you could nocurrentaction need to add a line at the end of the update function nocurrentaction i definitely call this the best but it take much code to implement of course if you need to move and rotate at the same time have to tweak it a it will also get messier when you add different types of a more general i would think about making a base action and deriving specific action classes from then you could just push actions to the and your update function could call the update which would do the work the two sections of your game components update function is doing are just some ideas to think i hope something here will get you last thing i wanted to mention was that i see you using gametime variable that is passed to the amount your component moves and rotates may need to be a function of the elapsed time since update was last meaning that the update function would move and rotate your game component based on the amount of time that has not just how many times the update function was not very good at explaining and it depends on how like your game to here are a different from shawn hargreaves an xna forum discussing the point i was trying to

all boils down to what responsibilities do you wish to assign to the client and the implementer of the defensive programming you force the implementer to check for error conditions which can be costy or even impossible in some imagine a contract specified by the binarysearch for example your input array has to be you detect this while running the you have to do a manual check for it which will actually bump the execution time an order of to back my opinion up is the signature of the method from the point is people and frameworks now tend to implement exception translation mechanisms which is used mainly to translate checked exceptions to runtime exceptions that will just pop up if something wrong this way the client and implementer of the contract has less to worry about while dealing with each this is my personal opinion backed only with what limited experience i love to hear more about this

all in a gui queue are best done by a single thread as there is an implied order in the events thus they need to be done which is why most gui apps have a single thread to handle though potentially multiple events to create them it does not preclude the event thread from creating a job and handling it off to a worker pool on a socket can potentially by done in parallel as each request is stateless and can thus by done independently i know that is over simplifying jobs were each job is independent and placed on this is the classic case of using a set of worker each thread does a potentially long operation independently of the other on completion comes back to the queue for another

allocation use anything like it uses a piece of memory called program stack which is just a contiguous segment of a special register that stores the top of the when a new object is created on stack the top is raised thus increasing the when an object is deallocated out of the top is lowered thus decreasing the you try to allocate a too large object on stack or go too deep into recursion the top will outgrow the maximum allowed size of the stack and this is called stack actual direction of stack growth or decreasing vary by but general idea is the same regardless of actual

allow for rounding errors when comparing floating point rather than testing for something like this is usually what you epsilon is some suitably small like are several reasons why floating point math not all values can be represented exactly for can not be represented in binary floating point in the same way that be represented in is that floating point only uses a fixed number of significant digits relative to the decimal hence the so on large small fractions effectively get truncated never assume that floating point computations return an accurate

always the usual culprits of but i would suspect that it may have something to do with the time being taken to perform the try increasing the length of time the animation or adjusting the size of the values you are moving a second is not much time to transition from 100 to 15 and vice so you may just be running into not having a smooth enough resulting in a choppy remember that time is key and that your target should be at least 30 fps for a smooth

am a enthusiast and this just for my curiosity am trying to model the stackoverflow community as a assume that the people in the so community are nodes and that the answers given to any of the question establishes a relationship between these the relationship can be assumed to be from answer or the graph could be weighted and that the weights of the nodes could represented number of on the scale of 0 to kind of does one end up with at any given snapshot of is it is it a the graph is continuously evolving over a period of time and i would like to understand its structure and there a way where can i retrieve this relationship data from may be so apis or some one from so can help me out with a network whose degree distribution asymptotically follows a power law a network that has characterized by presence of connections between almost any two nodes within them and most pairs of nodes are connected by at least one short the stackoverflow community a or a small world

am becoming more and more addicted to the project euler however since one week i am stuck with the is a short version of the is totient for any given integer of for which can iterate to create a for example starting from starting from 18 we get a chain of length 4 problem is to calculate the sum of all primes less than 40e6 which generate a chain of length built a function that calculates the chain length of any number and i tested it for it works well and of all which generate a chain of length 12 of all which generate a chain of length my algorithm scale when i apply it to the it takes several hours to so i stop it because the project euler problems must be solved in less than one thought that my prime detection function might be slow so i fed the program with a list of primes to avoid the primality the code runs now a little bit but there is still no way to get a solution in less than a few hours i want is there any that i am missing here i really understand how to be more efficient on this am not asking for the because fighting with optimization is all the fun of project any small hint that could put me on the right track would be the formatting of the comment is wrong and i delete so here it is calculate the totient i use the a given call p the list of are factors of 18 18 6 in this way i calculate any the function that gives me the factors is built in matlab i forgot to mention that i code in maybe i should rewrite the factorization euler how can i make it more

am building a annotation where end users can select and annotate a section of text from an html programmatically accessing and working with the selected text and corresponding range is straightforward using and am running into a when i try to put all of this together in a everything works find in but in safari i noticed immediately that when i click on an html button the the current user text selection goes as if clicking on the button repositioned the text my code that attempts to access the executes from a script in this which then reports that no selection dug in and took a look at how google specifically their application handles as essentially the behavior and mechanics of selecting text and clicking or corresponds to my annotation in google they load the text of the document to be edited into an playing around with i learned that firefox supports multiple selection ranges in a web page that contains multiple or in other i can select a section of text in the base and a separate section of text in the iframe without the first selection this google docs solution works for both firefox and safari two browsers that interested but when i built a simple example page to test this it would not work in as soon as i click a button or make text selection in the root page of the the current iframe selected text goes know what missing here to get this to or have a suggestion on another way to get this to to support multiple text selections cross

am building a using the where the server is sending an image to the client through a socket every was using but besides the overhead of this sometimes the client ended up with more than one image on the and i still though of a clever mechanism to split the bytes of each image i just need the most recent tried using but got to the conclusion that i send 100kb only 64kb and even i use more than otherwise the packet would be divided along the network and the chances of losing parts of the packet would be now a bit should i continue using tcp and put some escaping bytes in the end of each image so the client can separate or should i use send dgrams of 1500 bytes and come up with a mechanism for ordering and key goal here is transmitting the images very i mind losing some on the way as long as the client keeps receiving newer should i use another thanks in send an image every 50 should i use tcp or

am considering using com interfaces within an embedded system that has a limited and i am looking for an com implementation using simple in particular with little or no use of templates and without use of exceptions i know com use exceptions but an implementation could use them this point mainly looking for definitions of all the core com types variant plus some helper classes for smart bstrs some level of support for implementing queryinterface and idispatch might be nice but i can also do that like to find an itypeinfo and an embedded implementation of dcom would be know i could use source supplied with visual studio but i would rather avoid it because of the complexity of pulling in a lot of definitions that i plus i want to avoid any possible legal issues with using it on a also thoroughly familiar with atl and i use such a heavily templated approach due to compiler i have a lot of experience with com and dcom so i could write all of the definitions and helper classes and i could even write my own dcom system if but rather use an existing implementation if there is do you have any com implementations work on embedded

am creating a wcf service that will be consumed by both and java client do not have any java experience in the so are looking for guidelines or rules to follow to ensure that we do not accidentally include any types in our wcf service interface or do anything else that would preclude it from being consumed by a java client our worries if what should we be wary example of a concern is whether a value is represented in the service interface in a manner that can be correctly understood by a java second example of a concern is the use of any nullable value types present some of our development teams are files to define the various objects that the wcf interface methods will take as arguments and return as return they are then using to classes from rationale behind this is that it guarantees that the generated classes contain anything that is downside is that this adds a development burden and also precludes us from documenting these classes using tags equivalent of javadoc that a wcf service can be consumed by a java

am developing an application in using the where the server sends a byte array with a bitmap to the the client loads it into the sends an to the and the server sends another and so length of the image buffer usually it is between 60kb and but seen that it if i put the client and the server in the same using everything works the server does and the client does endreceive and the whole buffer is i am now testing this in a wireless network and what happens server sends the callback function on the client is but there are only 1460 bytes to read only be in callback function on the client is called now with the rest of the buffer it be 1000 bytes or 100 always like a first packet with 1460 bytes is and then the second packet contains the can work around this by joining both byte arrays but this seem not even sure why this is is it some restriction on the why then wait for the whole data to be i i have to worry about any help would be i send a packet over it is split into two

am going to propose a third a party place like amazon s3 or mosso cloud both provide apis that you can use to upload the file and both provide cdn capabilities so the files will load quicker then they would off your servers or pulling from your is a nice option because it is the best of both the downside of storing images in the database is that it is additional stress on your application and database servers the file and pulling and it also causes your database to grow in size which can mean you will need more hardware downside of storing them in the file system is that you now have an issue with scaling as if you want to add additional web servers they would each need a copy of the image or you would need create a dedicated server for these file system access could be a future bottleneck to worry

am not sure what counting your bugs is going to do with out something to compare it what if the software you made was very hard and had lots of edge you need some kind some kind of though one of the other answers was clearly a joke code reviews are also probably a good if you have too many bugs hire better engineers or have them write less added after considering bug is a like a unique sucky snow flake they have different levels of impact on your customers and i would at least take this into maybe adding severity measure of customer push for and engineering hours spent fixing it might help improve my concern i guess is that this is still over simplification of when it comes to developing software quality product a recently released game called fallout 3 won tons of awards and made lots of money least i but was also a buggy hunk of junk on pc at make sure you are tracking and optimizing the correct tracking bugs vs time is just tracking of bugs vs reading any more into it requires some level of assumption however correct or are your bugs are but one part of software if you want to continue you to support your software maintainability is a lot of times bug fixes can make things less maintainable if your coder did things in a this in turn makes future fixes and features harder and fixes can add new

am working on a ai using a technique known as i am attempting to train a network that can move around a two dimensional space given a variety of values that are stored in what is effectively a two dimensional can see two strategies for using the neural each in the provide the scores from the different heuristics as inputs to neurons and create a nn that is effectively a very complicated move the non playing character to the location with the highest a compressed value for each heiuristic measure compressed into as few bits as and provide an input neuron for each of these am quite interested in option two because it presents the least amount of calculations required runtime of the game is quite however i am confused as to what approach i could use to create the version of the heiuristic i know there are techniques such as fourier transformations out however i know if these will suit my basically i am looking for a way to convert a 50x50 array of doubles into one or maybe two double these two double values can be i need to be able to get the original values i just need a reasonable mechanism for changing the input data into a small alternative to these two possibilities is to somehow encode a based on some distance from the npc you get the actual values for a and an approximation for a i know exactly how i would wire this but it at least gets rid of the need to evaluate every cell every turn of the game i am looking at about 5 million rounds at approximately 1 second per any simplification i can come up with would greatly apologise if this making much it is quite a difficult problem that has stumped me for a and i think of an easy way to describe to add change to chris refined what i am looking what i am looking for is a way to approximate a line can convert the 2d map into a in as few parameters as i have used cubic splines for interpolation however i need something a lot more feasable for a that varies between and quite what i am realling looking for i suppose is a of the know there are techniques such as cubic splines that i can work out some and these values are a reasonable analogy for what i am looking i need a way to take the 2500 values and come up with a small representation of these values that i can use for the neural i think the nn can be trained to infer the true meaning of these or at least to determine some correlation between the representation and the real so it necessarily need to be a reversible but i think many one way functions as are actually going to be very helpful a 2d map of doubles in as few as

an app to hit a web server 10 times a second is not a good web servers are designed for less frequent client requests and probably larger processing times and reponse sizes than your game will be not to say a web server be able to cope just that it would not be an efficient any type of app that requires multiple packets per second you really should think about a lighter protocol than http which is fairly for example if your game needs to send 4 bytes to register a battleship you really want to transmit an extra few hundred bytes of http recommend a browser plugin technology like siverlight of both of those support tcp socket you would need to write your own server to sit at the other end of the tcp with that approach also have the advantage of being able to push data out to the clients without having to rely on client polling mechanisms which are required with

an easy way to do make sure syntax highlighting is on with the command to get a listing of all the highlight group and samples of what they look the group looks like it stands out well in my so use that in my example you can use any of the other like or match error pattern will keep you from greedily matching the largest even though other people are suggesting you use the regular expression probably not what you because it will match everything in between if there are two or more such patterns on a example will match this entire these words should not be highlighted same example but with will only match stuff inside these words should not be highlighted regular a common trick to make a group that matches everything but the character that you want to end your instead of using the which will match as many characters as it in this we make the group which says everything except this works the way you want it add the syntax match line without the to your

an interesting but like bobince you can only process one attribute per this regex will match everything up to the attribute interested you use as your replacement string to plug back in everything but the approach requires you to make a separate pass over the string for each of your target and at the beginning of each pass you have to create and compile the not very but if the string too large it should be a much bigger problem is that it catch duplicate if there are two attributes on a only catch the first i were doing this in i would probably use the regex to match the target then use a matchevaluator to remove all of the target attributes at but if the string really is no excuse for not using tools to process is what xml was

an programming approach rather than a procedural programming approach in a program really depend on the language it php or but on the type of problem you are trying to just going to use pseudocode in my examples as i am not too familiar with if you have a program where you are just performing a bunch of functions in then procedural is going to be for if a simple string manipulation a procedural approach would if going to deal with many different items as or any other representation then an approach would be if you had a bunch of and wanted them to then in you may do something along the line in the can drive as each car is a different their behavior can be defined they may be both subclasses or they may have common really comes down to the type of problem which makes either procedural approach better than and vice from the issue of procedural or it may be a kind of to have one source file with many this can also be said about classes which contain many functionalities which may be better performed as separate functions in separate issue here may be of code organization rather than deciding to pick procedural or organizing functions into separate source files may be needed here than to abandon the procedural approach to writing the there are plenty of programs written in the procedural programming approach which is and easy to

and are used to quickly store and retrieve data are stored in using are calculated by applying a hashing algorithm to a chosen value contained within the this chosen value must be a common value to all the can have multiple records which are be organized in a particular world founded in 1803 and lacking any computer technology had a total of 300 filing cabinets to keep the detailed information for their approximately each file folder were clearly identified with its unique number from 0 to filing clerks of that time had to quickly fetch and store client records for the working the staff had decided that it would be more efficient to use a hashing methodology to store and retrieve their file a client filing clerks would use the unique client number written on the using this client they would modulate it by 300 in order to identify the filing cabinet it is contained when they opened the filing cabinet they would discover that it contained many folders ordered by client after identifying the correct they would simply slip it retrieve a client filing clerks would be given a client number on a slip of using this unique client they would modulate it by 300 in order to determine which filing cabinet had the clients when they opened the filing cabinet they would discover that it contained many folders ordered by client searching through the records they would quickly find the client folder and retrieve our our are and our are important thing to remember is that computers their deal with numbers better than with so accessing a large array using an index is significantly much faster than accessing simon has which i believe to be is that the hashing part is to transform a large space arbitrary usually and mapping it to a small space known usually for this if very important to in the example the possible clients or so are mapped to a smaller main idea in this is to divide your entire data set into segments as to speed up the actual searching which is usually time in our example above each filing cabinet would contain about 300 searching the through 300 records is much faster than having to deal with may have noticed that some actually already do but instead of devising a hashing methodology to generate a hash they will in most cases simply use the first letter of the last so if you have 26 filing cabinets each containing a letter from a to you in theory have just segmented your data and enhanced the filing and retrieval this

another language will make you a better especially when the paradigm is significantly different from any other language you already c will give you a much better grasp of what you are actually it will be like being accustomed to a full featured graphing calculator and then learning to do all the and graphing yourself with just a blackboard and it will be a lot of but if you your mental model of the code will be much closer to what is actually happening in the really necessary to be a good i believe one of the characteristics of a good coder is the ability to understand the code in a higher level of and to see the system as a low level knowledge help you with the big if you want to be you have to move beyond just you should be able to understand the system at many different levels of abstraction from the upper conceptual diagram level down to the bare machine code knowing c will help you with understanding the low being able to debug c will help you with troubleshooting at all allows you to do the low level operations of but adds a bunch of abstraction mechanisms and code reuse facilities so you can be a little more if you already know a higher level language like and so i would recommend that you make some effort to become skilled in c and not try to tackle just the purpose of learning another language should be to expand your that even if you end up using it in a professional or hobbyist you will still improve your coding and analysis skills for the languages that you do

answer depends on the order you need them you pretty much have a choice of and thus have obvious analogues in breadth first and depth first and in general have trouble beating if you constraint the problem a there are a number of old fashioned algorithms for storing trees of arbitrary data as we used them a lot in the fortran one of them had the key trick being to store the children of say a2 and at the problem is that if your tree is sparse you waste and the size of your tree is limited by the array if i remember this you get the elements in order by simple do a look at knuth volume there is a ton of that stuff in

answer is i previously aware of the new proxy the only issue with it is that you need to target your code to the ordereduser model which is in a sense similar to simply doing a in other less verbose but you need to explicitly write your code to target as also have to be on sense is that you want queries to be including in third party apps that you in such a monkeypatching the base class is relatively easy and very unlikely to cause any in a central location as your you could import django now supports user

answer question 2 start or stop you just need to use the and the example code is right in the msdn question could have it poll a web service periodically if you want to do an you can set up the service for remoting and have it just listen on a tcp port for function then write a windows app that can use remoting to call the had to do this for a legitimate business app and it works very i would be very irresponsible if i include this setting up a computer so that it can execute arbitrary code is a idea and should be done very just because it be done mean it be if you go the web service how are you going to ensure that someone tamper with the web service and get malicious code to how do you know someone mess with your and point the app to their own web in the remoting how to you ensure that some other developer just create a proxy of their all amazed that microsoft even allows the to be used in a you can literally do anything you want with including launching the cmd shell and executing system urge you to seriously consider if this is truly necessary to you may be better served installing vnc or using remote or another app for remote other question you need to answer is the application be visible to the user on that remote if then you need to ensure that the service is set up to run under that you for launch word using the local system and it would never be visible to the person logged into that	
answer to this question honestly depends on the exact package system talking and how you have it some upgrades can break backward compatibility so the question much is going to break and how long will it take to fix as a rule of thumb i prefer to attempt an upgrade in a development and deploy to a testing environment to see how much work it will real reason i prefer to keep everything at the current version is are not usually kept and when the particular version of the product is no longer supported the task of upgrading to the latest version tends to be quite time consuming and and as such prefer to do a little work each time something can be upgraded rather than waiting and having to sort through everything later	
answer to your question has to do with the type of your if your application is mainly around communicating with the hardware and only a thin layer of business logic and user interface is then would be a better to interact with the scanners you need to talk to a this is better and faster achieved with the sdk will actually be a wrapper of code using a ton of which makes the code performing less on the other side your application requires a significant business layer a user then specifically is a better in that case the productivity gains far out weight the performance gains of important factor is the type of the devices the application is going to be deployed are you targeting windows mobile devices then is a safe for windows ce devices you need to investigate whether the compact framework is or some windows ce devices may not support all i recommend reading architecture pocket which is a recent document about architectural decisions for mobile

answers you got so far are i think however that you are mixing things in your question that belong so not possible to completely answer your question title states settings db these can be two quite different you have to differentiate between files that are files that are common for all users but and common files that every user should be able to work first category is use a suitable directory under one of the or second category is also files just need to be installed in the proper location by the setup which must be run with proper because standard users will not be able to write to the correct last category however is because there simply a directory in all windows installations that can be assumed to be writeable for all especially in business settings with user accounts it can be that the user has no write permissions for the local disc at only to their user directory somewhere on a server in the so there is no single simple way to grab that data location for your program and be sure it will work something you will possibly have to revisit for all programs and all use cases bonus points you should also always consider whether the files should go into the roaming profile and be available on all machines in a or whether they are tip i would give is to move away from desktop style database files like paradox or access files for applications that need to share data between users on a only with real database servers will you be able to have data on accounts	
anton if you put the extension methods directly on it would probably nothing particularly but the idea would be that you have a class that you create instances instead you just have purely static building static class public static return x public static return x public static this return returns equivalent of two functions and play the role of your and presumably have similar ones for primitive comparisons and so and then operators like would let you plug two expressions then you lose the ability to use operator which you could have used with your wrapper and instead you have to use method been playing around with the same kind of and the thing i always come back to is that i want to be able to define extension the team apparently considered these for with extension but they were lower priority because they play a part in the overall aims of	
any dbms more than there is a distinction between a read lock and an update in my i to used the but today it came to me that performance in my application would be a lot better if i could make this read vs write distinction in i have many threads that could safely read at the same but they obstruct each other for the sake of the infrequent but inevitable and i suppose i will have implement my own locking scheme in which the request for a both stalls the acquisition of further read locks and is stalled until the extant read locks are of this is profoundly and all of it is described in stupefying detail by date and others in any database theory text you care to not the first to face this out particularly for other thing i hoped for was any experiences and comments people might have on the strengths and weaknesses of any libraries you may have in stop making me feel wonder the most practical way to lobby microsoft to provide syntactical sugar similar to the from the msdn class private readerwriterlockslim cachelock new private innercache new public string return public void string closely parallels explicit use of with a little help from ms it could be as clean and simple as innercache new string return void string writelock locks in

app needs to keep an index of files in which the files are known by tags and suggesting a lucene document schema i s i i actual file is looked up by id in while a file has only one set of it may have multiple versions of its content identified by a only real solution it seems is one document with one document for each version such that the tags and attributes are redundant across many i i i i concern about this schema is whether it will be performant enough and compact so here are my i understand indexing scheme when the same long string is indexed as a field in many this really bulk out the index compared to if it were indexed just i create a single term make it and then add it to many does the full string data get duplicated for each document in the if this is the am i just best off putting the actual storage of the into far as i can the only info that comes back in query results is the documents themselves ordered by to determine which fields satisfied the query for a matched must i do separate queries on the fields for each or that this is just a so concurrent access is a and index updates will be quite infrequent time the user retags or a mainly concerned about response for a single user and to some extent about index size more for conserving memory rather than disk considered some alternative document but rejected my initial instinct was to avoid data duplication by splitting documents into two one type for representing a i i i then one document type for representing the of i i are a number of problems with it requires doing separate queries for content and and then matching content results to for each version document in my i must look at its fileid to then look up the corresponding file document in a separate while this is a standard relational my understanding is that a rather awkward and slow thing to do in for a query requiring both and i want to get back the file versions that include both those terms in either the or content in one and in the by splitting the from their this becomes very tricky likely maybe i can just keep content and together by keeping multiple content i i i i question is whether i can identify a content field so i can know which version content produced the i could name each content field corresponding to the version i i i i if i could identify the content that caused the document to match the consolidating the versions messes up the and attributes in lucene shared across

approach will not if you return a pointer to a local variable run into undefined instead allocate an array on heap with and copy data into it manually indexing	
approach you are referring to is viewmodel its where you have multiple complex view parts that need to bind to their own viewmodel the approach entails constructing a root viewmodel with properties for each child then the root view is bound to the root view model and each view displayed or is bound to the corresponding property on the root viewmodel would look like class rootviewmodel childviewmodela childa childviewmodelb childb view would look like could also implement this in away to allow yourself to select an active viewmodel would look like class rootviewmodel public childworkspaces public viewmodel activeworkspace public view would look like will result in the appropriate visual representation being selected implicity based on the type of the actual object stored in my response was in i tried my hardest to not get caught up in the syntax of it all you can see the plurality of can be often times we find the need to construct multiple to structure the viewmodel but all viewmodel entities would be somewhere within the root view model implementing mvvm in i prefer to infer what visual element to apply data context implicitly illustrated in the later half of this in more complex scenarios i prefer to use a datatemplateselector to conduct that but in super simple cases you can explicitly apply datacontext either imperatively in or declaratively through this

are a few reasons that i sometimes counsel people not to use certain cpan not all of cpan is and there are varying levels of maintenance for different everyone should consider how much work they have to do to use a particular cpan module and what that module saves them total cost of using any particular cpan module is not always a i say that people should not use any of but they should consider what they really need from external module dependency allows someone else to break your the cpan toolchain only ever cares about the latest version of a module and may upgrade your installation when it sees you have an earlier seen many applications break when the underlying external dependencies introduce new deprecated needed and so one of the reasons been developing my tools for companies to host their own cpan repositories so they can control there are other ways to mitigate but not many people are sophisticated enough to have a good process for work in an environment where all code has to be this seems like a silly requirement to a lot of but the risk management people have a job to do sometimes that compliance is mandated by various standards of and so unless the module is really going to save a lot of time and the benefit may not be worth the effort to go through that how many of you ever seriously inspect the code you get from there could be anything in cpan modules implement using a module just because on cpan and you want to write the three lines of code yourself is a bit you can talk about code reuse all you but eventually ad of some modules can be quite and and sometimes this is due to the long list of dependencies to just build and test the module even though you need those dependencies to actually use the it takes a lot of work to handle these cases in automated testing cpan authors are experimental not creating dependencies on their work means you end up with an unsupported module that get patched and no one else really cares getting your patches accepted is a really big deal for some important and you fix the unresponsive author without resorting to some process for using a locally patched version and overwritten by the cpan escape these reasons with glib answers about using another installing in a local and so you apply your counter arguments to every situation and anyone telling you such as the top post in seven reasons not to use that leon links really thinking about and there are many thoughtful ever start from the position of thinking anyone should or use evaluate the local evaluate the risks and develop safeguards for the and use modules not any different from any other sort of serious software development or business d

are a number of patterns that approach what you i would recommend getting a copy of martin excellent book of enterprise specifically chapter presentation you will find that any serious attempt to separate the domain and data source will lead you to one of many variations of the same visual etc all break down to three layers what differs is the responsibilities of each layer and how layers communicate with each the pattern basically strips the ui layer of anything not directly related to the typicall example being a field you want to highlight if a certain condition is in a the form would only only contain the logic to determine the whether the field should be the business rule that this state would be in a layer which does not directly depend on the actual far as the data source the main benefit being able to switch databases at the drop of a the main benefit is that changes to the database schema only affect the data source layer and extend into the rest of the if your stuck with datasets a good approach is the data

are communicating with a 3rd party service using via an xml file based on standards that this 3rd party they give us an xml template for each and we read it into a dataset using set the proper values in the and then write the xml back using this process has worked for several different i am now adding an additional file which requires that an integer data type be set on one of the here is a scaled down i look at the dataset created by my call to readxml to this the mydata table has columns of and if i then set the value of and then make the call to the export xml has no value for once if i take a way the then i do have a clientid i can set it and the exported xml has the proper the third party requires that this data type be thoughts on why the readxml would be renaming this tag or how i could otherwise get this process to i could revamp the way we are reading and writing the but would obviously rather not go down this path although these suggestions would also be tag name being overwritten with a type	
are correct in that it has no effect on the therefore it is up to your own style or those of your as to what you consult with them and agree on a you are coding for yourself then you should choose for the choice is not but consistency question you may ask should you use or for backwards compatibility had no information anything without a visibility modifier is public by should you bother writing public if again personal make a strong argument either way and convince me your choice is when i go through and clean up my own i like to put the visibility modifier and specify it even if	
are correct in that there is no built in way to duplicate a are however work the esiest way as i see it is to give the movieclips have to make the actual just write any name in the class field when setting up linkage on the top most movieclip that needs to be a name for you led another name for the bulb benifit is that now you have a class that you can initiate objects when you grap one of the movieclips you can duplicate it with the following function return var return assumes of cause that you can actually get a hold of one of the movieclips and mind you that it copy the state of the more importent note is that this only works if the you link the movieclips to the classes have to exist will create empty classes for solutions could against the classes them tag for and load the them against the classes as share the be loaded at has more info on how to do should be easy to find on their more exotic solution would be copy the bytecode of an not sure if that would work with something on the properly the solution using i remember correctly you still need to give the movieclips fake since getqualifiedclassname only returns movieclip but i could be	
are current for systematic build numbering and version number management in java to manage build numbers systematically in a distributed development to maintain version numbers in source available to the runtime to properly integrate with source to more automatically manage version numbers repository to integrate with continuous build are quite a number of tools and ant build system has a task that will maintain a build but not clear how to manage this with concurrent developers using or good and helpful partial or specific answers have appeared so summarize a few of it sounds to me like there is not really a strong on rather a collection of overlapping find my summaries and some resulting questions that folks might try to answer as to please provide comments if doing this you are using versioning of a specific checkout comes along for the build numbering can exploit this to create a unique build number that identifies the specific which we are using for legacy provide quite this level of manual intervention with tags gets you part way you are using maven as your build there is support for producing a version number from the as well as a release module for automatically producing use for a variety of but this helps those who to you are using as your build the following task description can help produce a java file capturing build which can then be folded into your build in a number of expanded on this idea to include thanks and maven hudson and cruise provide easy means for getting build numbers into a or into a is this enough to keep it from being tampered with intentionally or is it better to compile it into a class at build build numbering should be in a continuous integration system like to we have taken this but it does crack open the release engineering how does a release are there multiple buildnumbers in a is there a meaningful relationship between buildnumbers from differing what is the objective behind a build is it used for is it used primarily by developers to disambiguate between multiple builds during or more for qa to determine what build an if the goal is in theory this is what a release version number should provide why answer this as a part of your answers it will help illuminate the choices you have is there a place for build numbers in manual is this so problematic that everyone should be using a ci should build numbers be checked in to the if the goal is reliably and unambiguously identifying a particular how to cope with a variety of continuous or manual build systems that may should a build number be short and sweet monotonically increasing so that easy to stick into file names for easy to refer to in or should it be long and full of machine please provide details about how the assignment of build numbers fits into your larger automated release maven we know this is done and but not all of us have drunk the quite really like to flesh this out into a complete at least for the concrete example of our so someone could build a complete strategy based on this mark as anyone who can give a description for this particular case cvs tagging relevant ci config and release procedure that folds the build number into the release such that programmatically if you want to for another particular configuration link to the question from 23 oct accepted the answer because i think a reasonable while several of the other answers also include good if someone wants to take a crack at synthesizing some of these with consider accepting a different the only concern i have with is that it produce a reliably serialized build number it depends on a local clock at the system to provide unambiguous build which jul now include a class like the this allows the version numbers to be compiled into the final different forms of the version info are emitted in logging archived output and used to trace our analysis of output products to a specific final class svn should fill this out with the latest tag when checked private static final string private static final string 325 private static final pattern private static final string private static final string private static final string private static final string static matcher m if svn svn else if this necessary in this so but it is since we call it trunk in the real else public static string return answers a formatter string descriptor for the app version string public static string return svn public static string return public static string return public static string return public static string return public static final string stringbuilder sb new return comments if this deserves to become a wiki and version numbering for java projects	
are currently developing a b2b web shop based on java ee facelets and the technology has really worked very well so but now i am facing a small problem i just figure out how to are listed as where every item can be added to the shopping basket by clicking on a small icon at the end of the adding the product is done via ajax to avoid the full reload of the this works without any problems just by using a and an to call an which adds the selected product to the even the of the basket total always visible in the is working to the nature of there is no visible indication the changing total at the that the operation was successful or has been completed at now i want to add a little which is made visible next to the when the is stating that the item was added to the this box should automatically go away after a few is what i think should work and make the box float above the position where its markup it display the box at if i change the of the effect to it works almost as it is immediately shown when the icon is clicked and it dissapears 3 seconds after the ajax operation was but i want it to appear immediately after the because it would be wrong to indicate that the item was added to the when in fact the operation even started this becomes even more when i want to indicate some error or want to include some item specific information into the which is only available after the item was any ideas how to do and why adding two effects for the same event does not already looked at from the richfaces live the examples do almost work the execept that they add the second effect with explicitly stating the but even this does not work for tried using the for this which actually seems to be quite but no matter what i i attach anything to the also tried just event of the except one seems there is some behaviour regarding that just found this bug displaying a notification when ajax operation	
are currently implementing the full recovery model from the sound of this will allow you to restore to a point in time provided that you have a transaction log backup that covers the desired point in time full order to reduce the size of your required transaction log you should look to increase the frequency of your transaction log i would suggest once you have gauged the actual usage of your log you can then look to shrink it to a more suitable the key point to note here is that once a transaction log backup has been the inactive portion of the log file becomes available for use once the reason why a transaction log file grows continuously is if the transaction log backups are not being taken at all or their frequency is not would also suggest that you consider performing a mix of differential and full backups in order to reduce the collective size of your backed up an example schedule would be a weekly full say every with daily differential hope what i have detailed makes please feel free to contact me directly and i will happily assist you in deploying an appropriate backup strategy for your to stop the transaction from growing and restoring databases sql

are developing a skinned app with various rounded edges on most of its i am using window regions to define but nearly everyone objects to the jagged aliasing this because pixels can only be either fully opaque or fully come up with a solution to this using layered but we want to make sure this will run hopefully run on a variety of and i want to see if anyone has any better or ways to optimize what i know layered windows requires win2000 or and that is as that is already a requirement for other from some basic tests it looks ok on but no guarantee what i i have a call it with controls and text and whatever comprises that i have window b as a child of window except it has the style instead of so it can position itself outside region and is drawn on top of window b also has the and on i call with the flag and a source dc with a 32bit bitmap with an alpha to get it to draw with bitmap used in the source dc for window b is pretty much just the pixels around the border of the window that i want to blend smoothly from the background into full i would skip the whole two window approach and just use a single layered except that when using it is drawn from a buffer kept in in lieu of the typical messages and all and trying to get interactive child controls child to work well with that sounds like a remarkable hassle probably even work for basically window a with all the child controls and with window b floating directly on top of drawing a nice smooth i respond to messages and so on by moving window b along with and i have window b disabled so it can never get focus or input already go since parts of it that are of zero such as the majority of its inner already are excluded from what the pieces look to show what i mean a little with cyan used to mask fully transparent with an alpha channel pictured of a that would blend the pixels into it but i be certain really the best way to do i have two this sound or is there anything glaringly terrible about it currently it seems like using an buffer the size of the window can be up to even though very few pixels of it have any opacity data would it be worth the overhead and additional complexity of cutting it up into separate border pieces and compositing them layered windows to create smooth window

are not the one is bitwise or and one is logical y is a logical means the same as or and applies to bool it is used in conditionals or x and y in that case can be replaced with any expression that evaluates to a x y clause evaluates to true if either of the two conditions is if the first condition is true the file then the second condition need not and will not be single pipe is a bitwise to know what this means you must be understand how numbers are stored in the suppose you have a quantity that holds the value it is actually stored as 0x000f which is the same as 0000 0000 0000 1111 in the bitwise or takes two quantities and each pair of corresponding bits so that if the bit is 1 in either it is 1 in the if a 0101 0101 0101 0101 evaluates to 0x5555 in and b 1010 1010 1010 1010 is then a b 1111 1111 1111 1111 can use bitwise in to test if one or more of a particular set of bits is turned you might do this if you 12 booleans or binary values to test and they are all suppose you have a student a set of independent booleans might be things rather than store a boolean field for each one of those you could store just a single bit for each the might be bit might be bit you can if a test to see if no bits are turned except the is which is the bitwise or returns a 1 for each bit that is on in either if the result of the bitwise or above that means there are no bits turned on in the except the first bit but you tell for sure whether the first bit is because it it is is a corresponding and which is logical and and bitwise they have the analogous can if see if the first bit is turned on in a i believe i got voted down for

are other methods that been developed since mvc namely model view at martin website is a good overview of these own application uses a passive view as it allows us to rip off a ui and substitute another this an advantage for us as our software is a application meant to be used with a varity of metal cutting forms are thin shells which call a ui the forms implement a interface and itself with the ui we have a variety of forms used for different for example a setup form where the user modifies the extensive setup parameters for the machine he a shape entry a metal cutting form where the user positions the shapes to be all of this forms have a distinct the metal cutting form is different between different type of one may show a wysiwyg view of a flat plate of another is a spreadsheet style grid of the parts to be cut in the order they will be another yet shows the parts positioned on a rotating ui layer in turns takes the incoming input and executes the commands in turn interact with both the ui and nearly everything is handled through command objects as opposed to direct calls through structure allows a variety of uis to be connected to the same within a specific ui a variety of views can be what i have marked as model could be separate they would only be combined at the ui interface layer and above through the ui components referencing the different hierarchy looks like implement form implement ui inferaces with forms through interacts with the mode ui through the ui

are quite a bit of different arguments given i want to start by making clear that you cannot really make a each has its pros and and any code snippet will be more appropriate for one or the other that is as much to on the that you must know whether you have gc or not to write efficient argument is must know your environment and code that will make your code moving from one paradigm to the other and coding the same style will make your code more inefficient than what the gc really program makes thousands of heap memory allocations for short lived that it allocates and deallocates many with different size of a for each allocation you would end up calling and that requires locating in the list of free memory fragments the most suitable one to the specific malloc the memory is used and then it is freed with free in the cost of memory management is the cost of locating the a gc with a movable gc as java or after each gc run all free memory is the cost of acquiring memory for an object is really cheap cpu instructions in java at each gc only alive objects are located and moved to the beginning of the appropriate memory region it is a different region than the original the cost of memory management is primarily the cost of moving all reachable the premise is that most objects are shortlived so at the end the cost may be smaller than that of a one million objects allocated and freed on a single gc run amount to no extra in gc languages you can create all local objects on the they are on the other in a bunch of deallocations and new allocations is the memory is fragmented and the cost of malloc in systems you should use the stack as much as using the heap out of has another people used to one of the two memory systems will tend to write inefficient programs in the they are used to some idioms that are probably bad on the other clear example is a programmer that is used to allocate an object and reuse its internal pointers with new elements as is used to that way of allocation is reusing is if the same exact code is moved to a generational gc environment both are you get a funny in java generational gc the system will perform minor collections only on the younger only processing older generations in full but an object in the young generation could be referred to by objects in the older so extra work has to be performed to keep track of this in particular in garbage the system will mark the of where the old object resides and it then includes all the marked cards for processing during the minor effectively increasing the amount of work that the gc has to perform and possibly impacting object was alive during gc and it was moved that many times finally is moved to the old generation where it will not be moved in each gc run but can just stand but the programmer forces the object to become a it is moved once and it will again be moved each time the gc runs up to the time where it becomes old make a sensible you would need to get to programmers that know the environment write pieces of code that solve the same problem with the same algorithms with different mind sets about memory then compare the results of both of

are some things to think you want to cast or you want the result as a or an the result is an do you want the to be applied lazily the will not actually occur until the iterator reaches each distinction between since a casting operator often involves constructing a new and could be considered a implementations should automatically apply conversion operators defined for the types new object may or may not be implementations should allow one to specify a method implementations using existing suppose you pass as input a that you want to convert with any of the previous can return only a lazy also fails to use existing explicit cast because such a cast possible in for a generic type parameter says unless toutput has an explicit conversion operator defined for to this confusion is what lead to this topic in the first the cast to a generic type parameter not possible in this requires a as input instead of just an new would be except reflection is and must be used since hides the method name for explicit operators making it difficult to obtain a delegate any other methods should involve defined explicit conversion or allow one to specify a conversion language specification for conversion operators specifically their lack of a method name makes it difficult to obtain a delegate except through the alternative is to encapsulate or replicate the conversion increasing the complexity of your code since conversions are implicit in the presence or absence of conversion and should be handled by the we should not have to manually search for definitions of appropriate conversion operators with reflection at on the types methods for conversions using explicit conversion operators should really be a framework and with they except the language spec makes it hard to get a delegate for the conversion operators

are valid choices depending on architecting for extensibility say a plugin model for different imagereaders then your factory class cannot know about all possible in that you go the route asking each implementer until you find one that can read that sometimes ordering does matter you may have a genericimagereader that can handle but a jpeg2000imagereader that is better at walking the imagereader implementers will stop at whichever is you may want to look at sorting the list of possible imagereaders if a if the list of imagereaders is finite and under your then you can go the more traditional factory in that the factory decides what to already coupled to the concrete implementations of imagereader by the so adding rules for each imagereader increase if the logic to pick a imagereader is mainly in the imagereader then to avoid duplication of you can still go the route but it could just be hardcoded which types you

assume that you mean a 16 bit rgb not a display that has each color and as 16 i also assume you know how your and b values are encoded in that 16 bit because there are assuming you know how to split your color space you can now use a series of byte arrays to represent your what becomes a tricky decision is whether to go with byte because you have a body of algorithms that can already do the work on those arrays but will cost you a few extra bits per byte that you may not be able to or to keep everything crammed into that 16 bit format and then do the work on the appropriate bits of each 16 bit only you can really answer that if you have the opt for the byte array because probably faster and get a little extra precision to make the images look in the those the question is really answerable by how much time you have on your if you have a very fast you can implement a if you have a less fast works very well as if you have an even slower is your you really have no do the rescaling down in some external like and save a series of bitmaps that you load as you need

at least one virtual method in a class any of its parent means that the class will have a virtual and every instance will have a virtual the memory cost is quite the most important is the memory cost on the instances if the instances are for example if they are just meant to contain an in this case having a virtual pointer in every instance might double the size of the as for the memory space used up by the virtual i guess it is usually negligible compared to the space used up by the actual method brings me to my is there a measurable performance cost speed for making a method there will be a lookup in the virtual table at upon every method so if there are very frequent calls to this and if this method is very then there might be a measurable performance i guess it depends on the but has anyone run some reason i am asking is that i came across a bug that happened to be due to a programmer forgetting to define a method this is not the first time i see this kind of and i why do we the virtual keyword when needed instead of the virtual keyword when we are absolutely sure that it is if the performance cost is i think i will simply recommend the following in my simply make method virtual by including the in every and only remove it when you need does that sound crazy to for you kind is the performance cost of having a virtual method in a

basically manage all your memory according to the management programming guide for in you basically only need to worry about objects that you you own an object if you create it you create an object by specifically allocating it using or copying it using or one of their if you own an you are responsible for releasing it when you are finished with other object not owned by if you need to use such an object for any extended period outside the scope in which you received you need to specifically take ownership of the object by either sending it a message or copying answer your last if you are creating a lot of temporary objects in a loop or some other you can create your own autorelease see the for nsautoreleasepool for more information about using please that you should really only do this after profiled your application and found that it is using too much memory and would benefit from this kind of if you are creating and releasing a lot of heavy objects and want to rely on autorelease you can specifically allocate and initialize them and then make sure to release them on your own as soon as finished with most objects that have convenience creators have similar initializers for creating the object

been tackling similar problems and found a couple of solutions that emk can link to external sql data sources so you can use odbc to connect to a mysql database and share you can find more information we tried it and found it to be pretty slow to be is a product that claims to allow you to perform data replication and data transmission between mysql and other structured is possible to use web as a web service that your app can then push and pull data we found a couple of wrappers for this in and can put a trigger in the filemaker database so that every time a record is changed part of a record you are interest you can call a web service that updates a mysql or memcached version of that data that your website can found that people like filemaker because it gives them a very visual interface onto their data very easy to make quite large applications without too much development when it comes to collaboration with many users or presenting this data in a format other than the filemaker application we found performance a real

been working with some externaldataexchange based communication in wf my understanding is that when working with a this a state communication is and using sql persistence and a eventargs that is marked as would assume that when i do something like scope new imyedeservice service some causes scope to would expect that my event fire on the it appears to actually be so this leads me to believe this is not you could see how the data committed to a database in being rolled but the workflow moving foward could be anyone confirm this and if do you have a workaround to the message a transactional what i want is one of these two workflow react to the message i enqueued via external data exchange until the transaction that enqueued the message is committed like service broker does in sql the workflow does start acting on the event i it should rollback as i see how this could occur using the default like the workflow execution to remain so i want to switch out the scheduler if i have foundation externaldataexchange messages queued and

between single queries can happen as they lock single not the entire update query gets an update lock on a few rows in a and the select query gets a read lock on some other rows in the the update query then tries to get an update lock on the rows that are read and the select query tries to get a read lock on the rows that are update can get even more complicated with escalading the database decides that there are too many single rows locked by a transaction so that it should be escalated into locking a section of the table or the entire this means that the lock may affect rows that directly involved in the

birch has a good idea with using triggers and a you can find out more in the create trigger are you sure that you need to call an executable right away when the row is it seems like that method will be prone to because mysql might spawn multiple instances of the executable at the same if your executable then there will be no record of which rows have been processed yet and which have if mysql is waiting for your executable to then inserting rows might be very if chad birch is then will have to recompile so it sounds of calling the executable directly from i would use triggers to simply record the fact that a row got inserted or record that information in the either with new columns in your existing tables or with a brand new table called say then make an external program that regularly reads the information from the processes and marks it as specific solution will depend on what parameters the external program actually your external program needs to know which row was then your solution could be like make a new table called with fields and and for all the other make a trigger like trigger insert on each row insert into values your batch script can do something like the first row in the until is this you can have more control over when and how the data gets and you can easily check to see whether the data actually got processed check to see if the table is

built a little test app with sl and it work that well but i think i was doing tried using sl in views but its slow to switch pages since its loading new sl instances all the tried a single sl app which meant it contained all the control code as well but that relegates the server to data access which only needs some service code no need for mvc may work better if we dispense with the idea of there being many view in my next iteration i shall be using controllers to respond with xml or json directly to requests from a silverlight app which contains the however this approach would still leave some questions for how does the controller get to have a say in what view is actually be getting the feeling that sl to are yet shaping up as a good some web apps may benefit from some sl elements for yet the app remain firmly in on the other an app whose ui is purely in sl internally using some similar really need mvc on the early it will take while for us early adopters to see what really works and what there being a beta for version 3 with more coming from ms in the way sl can access serverside data may change things

but not magic is not the number of lines in a input file which slows you down is a very small when an re is it basically has to write a program which can parse the input file based on that speed of that always depends on the complexity of the will be very will be somewhat slower and anything that involves backtracking having to back up in the usually anything involving multiple of which yours is an will be slower you can do to minimize the number of lines beforehand will help to some extent but as to optimizing the re often considered a black one possibility is to first strip out the lines other than those between lines where the annotation stops and tend to worry too much about optimizing my res not usually this my view is that they will take as long as they if too i usually look for another solution which is faster but not so the case of your re where you wanted to get all annotation xml where the attribute contains i would do it in perl awk for us since the input file was reasonably fixed on first line also on first line on last line and on its own would be fast as a simple line turning on echo when the conditions were met printing that printing any other line when echo was and turning echo off when conditions were met printing far less adaptable but almost certainly faster your

c and give you a lower level of abstraction with increased provides a breadth of access to underlying machine functionality that are not necessarily exposed with other adds the convenience development of a fully object oriented language which add an additional performance in terms of real world i see these languages applied in the following level device where access to stable code is or server development where memory management needs to be fine tuned be left to generic garbage collection environments that require access to libraries that do not interface well with more modern managed managed can be used to access the it is not a seamless provides a managed memory model that adds a higher level of abstraction this level of abstraction adds convenience and improves development but complicates access to lower level apis and makes specialized performance requirements is certainly possible to implement extremely high performance software in a managed memory but awareness of the implications is syntax of is certainly less demanding error than and for the initiated a shallower learning client application performance server development for that benefits from the that require the benefits of the framework in the language it was designed makes the valid point that the use unsafe and unchecked keywords break through the layer of abstraction upon which is i would emphasize that type of programming is the exception to most development scenarios and not a fundamental part of the language is the case with	
c function prototype simply wants a pointer to a buffer and the size of the what it expects to see inside the buffer is the my assumption wild guess is that the bitmap bits in a bytearray guess this needs to be broken down into but i think the general idea is get the data from your into probably a byte allocate an unmanaged buffer to store the copy the byte array to the pass the buffer pointer to your c free the buffer when you are can allocate an unmanaged buffer using pnt you can copy your byte array because its unmanaged you will be responsible for freeing it when you are as if you have access to the c it would be much better to simply pass the bitmap handle

can speak to this from recent painful this is a very old method that predates the metadata api on which both ant and eclipse in our only benefit is in defining your if using eclipse we and i you can define your project as being based on a particular as long as you remember to add new components to your your project hangs thing that baffled us for a are the many uses of noted the these come in managed and unmanaged flavors and are in the words of a recent post on the sfdc for isvs to deploy their stuff into various unknown orgs both managed and unmanaged packages have limitations that make them unsuitable and unneeded for deployment from development to production within an or in any case where doing custom development and intend to distribute code to a large anonymous this is what you see when you click in the web that we sometimes call seem to be just a convenient way to keep a project definition the conclusion coming toward is that our team not an does not need packages in any other forms of both eclipse and rely on the metadata in theory they are capable of exactly the same in reality they appear to be the migration built into the ide for makes deployment as easy as it can be is not and gives you a nice look at what it intends to on the other seen ant do some things the ide could so probably worthwhile to learn process leaning toward is to keep all our projects in and use the svn structure as the project definition will work with this and respect and we use eclipse and sometimes ant for no apparent need for packages the one more thing to be aware of not all components are some things must be reconfigured by hand in the target one example would be queues and groups also need to i likewise the metadata api directly process field deletions so if you deleted a field in your you need to delete it by hand in the there are other cases as useful steve

can think of three ways to do it with standard the first you will get in the return value whether another application already registered the very same hotkey whether a shortcut uses this or registered the hotkey because it is or you get the application name this windows hooks or async key states for i think it is possible to detect hotkeys since you might use hotkeys in a context replace by if the last four keystrokes were that you could inject the hotkey using your window and test if the event on the other some cases of that are implemented via hooks do not consume the keystroke so it will still get approach i would first make sure that for entering a you have to type that exact shortcut into your shortcut box that the user will see which application uses then use so you will notice future if another application tried to steal this shortcut from	
can think of two ways to do workspace variables in eclipse to point to the exact location where the workspace if you need then the developer can put everything in the workspace on then define the variable and compilation is always done from within meaning you truly need any absolute paths then change the projects to all use relative paths and check the eclipse into source when a developer checks out everything in the classpath and file will be at the root level in the project and all paths will be option you may need to have multiple or and have the developer copy the appropriate one into that copy into for

can understand how one can write a program that uses multiple processes or a new process and use or create multiple threads and use those sorts of communication also understand context that with only once the operating system schedules time for each process there are tons of scheduling algorithms out and thereby we achieve running multiple processes now that we have processors we could have two processes running simultaneously on two separate question is about the last how does the kernel control which core a process runs which system calls or even schedule a process on a specific reason working on a project for school where we are to explore a recent topic in computing and i chose there seems to be a lot of material on how to program in that kind of environment to watch for deadlock or race but not much on controlling the individual cores i would love to be able to write a few demonstration programs and present some assembly instructions or c code to the effect of i am running an infinite loop on the 2nd look at the spike in cpu utilization for specific code or for clarification many people have said that this is the purpose of the and that one should let the os take care of i completely but then what asking trying to get a feel is what the operating system actually does to do not the scheduling but more a core is what instructions must be executed to have that core start fetching to control which core a process runs

can use the ole db provider and an ado connection openschema method to get schema information as a recordset is arguable better than a collection because it can be basic methodology is to use adschematables to get the base tables then use each to fetch adschemacolumns for is adschemaindexes is where you will find unique not sure wether these can be distinguished from unique also the names of foreign keys to plug into the adschemaforeignkeys rowset watch for the gotcha that jet allows a fk based on a nameless pk of validation rules and check constraints can be found in the adschematableconstraints using the table name in the openschema then use the name in the call to the adschemacheckconstraints filter for gotcha is a constraint named so best to escape the null characters form the remember that validation rules can be either or constraints are always so you may need to use the table name in the for adschematableconstraints is will be in anotehr gotcha is that the field is 255 characters so any validation constraint definition of more than 255 characters will have a null for access query objects based on select sql is you can use the view name in adschemacolumns to get the column are in being all other flavours of access query objects including parameterized select for the latter i prefer to replace the parameters syntax with create procedure in the boterh looking in the you find the parameters can be enumerated by using an adox catalog object to return an ado command command enumerate the collection for the for and for for and properties such as unicode compression you need to use another kind of for a long integer autonumber in can be found using an ado catalog object luck

common lisp implementations can dump executable sometimes these are two files but often this can be just one but the executable usually runs only on the platform it was compiled commercial implementations like lispworks or allegro cl have extended capabilities for example one can remove unused parts of the lisp this is called is some information about lispworks is commercial and covering platforms can be you would have to buy the development environment delivery is free on popular lispworks has a graphical library for mac and the latter is based on the oldish the advantage is that the code can be very portable over the lispworks development environment itself is a lispworks on the mac for example the 32bit version and the 64bit version runs on both powerpc and x86 from a single about versions of common lisp and libraries is collected on ms windows applications is not the strongest part of common

compiler might consider that the object is useless besides its use in function and hence inlines the whole that the linker would never see that either class even existed just an linking between testa and class would be done inside there would be a conflict if linker was looking for class foo but the linker simply does not look for it you have linking errors if compiling in debug mode with no optimizations enabled

compilers are much better at doing straightforward like this across your entire code ensure that you are enabling your compiler by compiling your release version with the right optimization if you use visual you might want to experiment with favoring size over speed are a lot of cases where small code is code generation which enables the compiler to do and maybe even also need to remember that the vast bulk of your code matter from a performance perspective optimizing this code will have no user visible need to define your performance goals early on and measure frequently to make sure meeting when outside of your use tools such as profilers to determine where the hot spots are in your code and optimize another poster without measuring and understanding optimization at all its just random you have measured and determined that a particular function or loop is a there are two approaches to optimize optimize it at a higher level by reducing invocations of the costly this will usually lead to the most algorithm level improvements fall into this level an algorithm will a better should result in running the hotspot code calls cannot be then you should consider look at the actual machine code that the compiler is emitting and determine what it is doing that is the most costly if it turns out copying temporary objects is then consider prefix over if doing an unnecessary comparison at the beginning of the flip the loop into a and so without understanding the code is any blanket are next to

completion it is a kernel object built into the windows os that is there to give you an intelligent way to manage multithreaded asynchronous very simplistic a little you tell the iocp about the io jobs you want it will perform them asynchronously and maintain a queue of the results of each of those your call to tell the iocp about the job returns immediately does not block while the io you are returned an object that is conceptually like the iasyncresult it lets you block if you choose or you can provide a or you can periodically poll to see if the job is doing those the iocp uses a thread the thread pool tries to limit the number of threads to the number of processors or less but the intent and the default is to limit it to the number of the iocp makes a provision for the fact that the tasks on these threads might asycn io tasks but you might have provided it some other kind of you can give the iocp another number this is a number of threads above the which the iocp is allowed to go up to due to one of the other threads being the goal is to have up to the of threads that are actually doing something not if this then for a while the iocp will be using more threads than the usual but it will refuse to make any new threads until it can get back down to the is a brief conceptual and as i in some but it should give you the general jeffrey books on the windows os cover this in detail these books are out of print you can find these books and they actually cost more used than they did i think is the title but there may have been an updated version of the book with a different

created a set of javabean annotations working on a new version right so the trunk code match the update site them can be quite usually approach it by creating a project in eclipse with the test code and building then make a copy and turn off annotation can then use eclipse to compare the test project to the copy of the have too many test cases yet very tedious to generate so many combinations of but this is annotations in a build system is actually very take a look at for an example of how used in an ant and using it in eclipse is just a matter of making a plugin specifying the annotation processor extension and turning on annotation processing in projects that want to use used annotation processing in a continuous build building the annotations then using it in the rest of the really pretty found this to be an issue be careful of what you do in the i generate a lot of code in mine and it runs a little slower in that java6 processors can run a little faster because they are part of the normal compilation had trouble getting them to work properly in a code generation capacity think much of the problem is support and running for i stick with java is one of the things in the annotation the api has a object that handles all each ide provides an implementation that converts this into appropriate error messages at the right location in the only thing i did was to cast the processing environment object so i could check if it was bring run as a build or for editor if i eventually change this to just do error checking at edit time so it can report errors as you be though you need to keep it fast for use during reconciliation or editing gets generation a little more per annotation processor specifications state that you are not allowed to modify the class that contains the i suspect this is to simplify the processing rounds do not need to include the annotated preventing infinite update loops as generate other and they recommend that generate a superclass for all of the methods and anything else i need to i also have the processor verify that the annotated class extends the generated for class foo extends generate a class in the same package with the name of the annotated class plus and verify that the annotated class is declared to extend have seen someone use the compiler tree api to modify the annotated class this is against spec and i suspect plug that hole at some point so it would recommend generating a happy using annotation very well especially looking at build i would recommend sticking with the java5 annotation processors if doing code generation you need to run a separate tool called apt to process then do the that the api for java 5 and java 6 annotation processors is the java 6 processing api is better but i just had luck with java 6 processors doing what i need java 7 comes out give the new processing approach another free to email me if you have this

currently researching methods for storing user roles and permissions for based some of these projects are web some are currently struggling to find the best method to achieve what looking for in a portable way across project looking to leverage active directory as our single point of contact for basic user because of looking to not have to maintain a custom database for each users since they are already stored in active directory and actively maintained we want to write our own security if possible and would like to use something like the security application blocks provided by projects require only basic such as or no other projects require more complex users of those applications might be granted access to some but not and their permissions can change across each an administration section of the app would control and define this the ad using integrated windows authentication to perform authentication on our this works well for finding out basic user and seen that can be extended to provide an active directory roles so i can find out any security groups a user belongs what seems like the downfall of this method to me is that everything is stored in active which could lead to a mess to maintain if things grow too this same also heard of active directory lightweight directory which seems like it could extend our schema and add only application specific attributes and problem i find anything on how this would be done or how this there are msdn articles that describe how to talk to this instance and how to create a new but nothing ever seems to answer my question based on your am i going down the right is what looking to do possible using just active or do other tools have to be methods looked multiple files a custom security model and database to manage users across group and role management in with active

currently use codeigniter as my framework of choice when using one of the things i am wrestling with is the idea of a and how to represent that properly within to my codeigniter has a front controller that delegates to page in my thought each page would have own all too often though i see someone using a page controller stuffed with many so in that each action becomes own never really liked the idea of stuffing many methods into one because it seems like there will be too much overhead if you only need one method or two in the controller at a seems more reasonable for each page to have own and the actions would only correspond to something you can do on that particular am i thinking about this the wrong makes it more confusing is notice in some web applications where they will have one controller that will have multiple methods but then on others they actually have a login and a register what is the proper use of a defines the traditional concept in

database has a royalty free local server engine and record level great delphi tdataset descendant components code and a great full text search full text search supports and near advantage also provides score and scoredistinct scalar functions which return the total count of all instances of words in the search full text indexes are maintained at record update time which means they require any the indexes are in a compressed therefore the actual index size can be much smaller than the physical it is possible to perform full text searches on but this requires a physical search of the record data and can be much indexed searches use bitmap filters for optimal online help has all the details as far as indexing

decided to look at the problem and see if i could break it into 5x5 solutions with the ending of a solution one jump away from the corner of assumption was that 5x5 is it is and i ran and looked at the i drew a 10x10 numbered grid in excel with a 5x5 numbered grid for then i just searched the results for that would be a jump away from the start of the next for the first i searched for x 10 grid 5 x 5 grid 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 5 6 7 8 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 10 11 12 13 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 15 16 17 18 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 20 21 22 23 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 is a possible puts it a diagonal jump up to 5 the first corner of the next 5 x puts it with last square of 25 in the which is two jumps away from puts it with last square of 97 in the which is two jumps away from square can be any valid because end point the mapping of the solution from 5x5 to 10x10 is as the square is starting on the opposite instead of ran and picked one at should be possible to all do now that 5x5 solutions are know to be valid with endpoints legal moves to the next 5x5 number of 5x5 solutions was which means storing the solutions for further calculation and remapping is pretty i did this this gives you one possible solution above 5x5 solutions as one through four if i return 5 col5 50 row5 if i return 5 5 col5 50 row5 if i return 10 5 col5 50 row5 if i return 15 5 col5 50 row5 if i return 20 5 col5 50 row5 for i in for i in for i in for i in some one double check the i think this is a valid solution and method of breaking up the

deciding what dimensions to make a i usually consult major high traffic sites like usually decent indicators of what an acceptable layout dimension right google news has a layout which autosizes to but has a minimum width of has a fixed layout of you may want to do your own survey of but the site working on at the moment has an 800px fixed it is a reasonable dimension for displaying the type of content we are and it will not alienate a dimensions should be specified in or relative to the no reason to define the width of your layout according to the height of a just because a bigger font size is used does not mean the screen resolution is automatically unless you are working with fonts where you can define the number of characters on each row of there much point in making your layout dimensions proportional to type text will automatically wrap around the column width i use frameworks like yui or jquery to shorten development these frameworks also largely conceal inconsistencies between different jquery masks inconsistencies in ecma scripting implementations between different yui largely does the same but also provides advanced ui components and css resets that work across most major beyond i no longer worry about supporting browsers like layout seems pretty if you understand how to build layouts and separate presentation from then you should be is the current w3c i think xhtml is supported by any major browsers ie still does not even fully support xhtml so it is best to write css1 is fully supported by most major while css2 is planning to launch a separate version of the site with a format specially tailored to mobile as tvanfosson mobile users will likely be interested in different content from desktop things like and other images will have to be removed or scaled navigation interfaces and website flow will have to be altered as

doing something close to development and i can tell you what we svn revision number and as well as the machine it was built on and by whom burned into the build full build showing whether it was a any interesting output the data baking tools a list of files compiled and any compiler warnings compresses very being actual binaries anywhere from build produced as a side effect of a linker command address and a sort of file indicating what was burned into the final binaries and size for as well as the debugging database also mail out the result of running some tools over the files to interested we actually archive these since we can reproduce them but these reports and delta of filesystem broken down by file type and delta of code section sizes we have unit tests or functional tests smoke those results show up in the build not thrown out anything yet our target builds usually end up at or 32 mib per and fairly do keep uncompressed copies of the binaries around for 1 week for ease of after that we keep only the lightly compressed about once a month we have a script that extracts each that the build process produces and a whole month of build outputs together takes advantage of only having small differences per average day might have a dozen or two builds per the buildserver wakes up about every 5 minutes to check for relevant differences and a full on a large very active project for one month might be but certainly the most been able to diagnose everything this occasionally a hiccup on the buildsystem and a file actually a the revision supposed to be when a build but usually enough evidence of this in the sometimes we have to dig out a tool that understands the debugging database format and feed it a few addresses to diagnose a crash have automatic stackdumps built into the but usually all the information needed is had to crack the archives to but we have the info and i have some interesting ideas on how to mine bits of useful data from

done that back in 2000 my first windows program ever was a hook i did was implementing the filter hook driver and writing a userspace application that prepared a filter table on what to allow and what to when you get around your initial set of blue screens below for my debug tip in kernel the filter mode driver is quite easy to use it gives each packet to a function you wrote and depending on the return code drops it or lets it packets at that level are quite fragments are not reassembled and it looks more like the end of things no ethernet headers so have quite a bad time decoding the packets to filter with that also is the firewall hook as discussed in this you are on vista or server 2008 better have a look at wfp filtering that seems to be the mandated api of the day for writing know about it other than google turing it up some minutes ago when i googled for the filter hook forgot the debug dbgview shows dbgprint and more important it can also read them from the dump file your last blue screen so sprinkle your code with dbgprint and if it bluescreens just load the dump into dbgview to see what happened before it died very using this i managed without having a kernel

driven architecture is the idea that you create models which express the problem you need to solve in a way that is free of any at least implementation and then you generate implementation for one or more specific the claim is that working at a higher level of abstraction is far more powerful and in your models outlive technologies you still have something when your first language platform becomes obsolete that you can use for your next generation another key claimed benefit is that much of the boilerplate and can be once the computer understands the semantics of your it can help you claim this approach is 10 times more and that it is we will all be building software in 10 this is all just i am wondering what the outcomes are when the rubber meets the the version of mda is from the and seems very it is heavily based on which might be considered good or bad depending on who you ask leaning towards in spite of those it is hard to argue with the idea of working at a higher level of abstraction and the computer to understand the semantics of your problem and imagine a series of er models which simply express and then imagine using those to generate a significant portion of your first in one set of technologies and then again in another set of love to hear from people who really are doing mda right now or what tools are you how is it working how much of the theoretical promise have you been able to do you see a true 10x effectiveness you doing mda driven right if what tools do you and how is it working

easiest way of finding out how implemented is to try write some code which uses a captured compile then look at it in note that the which is not the one of the big differences between java and in this basic idea is that each level of scope containing at least one captured variable results in a new class with fields for the variables which have been if more than one then an inner scope also has a field for the next scope and so the genuine local variables on the stack end up being references to instances of the autogenerated an static void actions new for i int copyofi for j int copyofj foreach action in get different results if you take a copy of course this is compiled into code like static void actions new for i outerscope outer new for j innerscope inner new foreach action in class public int class public int public outerscope public void reference to the captured variable ends up going through the instance of the generated so not just a in this case nothing else in the code uses the captured but you can easily imagine it note how for any one iteration of the outer the five new instances all share one instance of you might want to try playing with extra code in the delegate to see how that affects things if the delegate changes that change will be seen in the next changes to be seen because the next delegate will be using a separate instance of	
easiest way to do this is probably by storing the object in the viewstate when the page loads the first having the user manipulate and then saving it back to the database when the user wants to save one of the problems with this approach is that if multiple users edit the same item at the same you could end up with a situation where data is user a loads page and starts making user b loads page and starts making user a presses changes are saved to user b presses changes are saved to overwriting user could get around this by using a timestamp to save the date and time of the last and comparing it to the one in the viewstate before committing the you could lock the item when someone begins editing stopping two people from making changes at the same though this solution is probably less reliable what happens if the user browses away from the page while

edited i initially criticised the problem description as my problems stem from way the concept of a is used in the the question implies the programs and tracks are all stored in one i thought the questioner was building his own which would make this in one structure but i have now decided probably not doing in which case less so go ahead and offer a real based on the assumption using an existing file and his entire data structure is stored in one file within that file if i am assuming wrong no doubt be will first offer one piece of general advice for situations like look at things from the perspective of the api user then design your api so that the code he will write flows easily with no need to deal with the details that are properly in your way to work on your api design is to write some user code first and define the api so that that code is easy to as a after you actually implement the api then have some test code to try it out on to more specific is a catalog of the three data types in the we can treat them as abstract data types or if you like and define a struct track to represent each a collection of programs stored in a a collection of a collection of audio would propose that you make your users pick out data from the you really hide the internals of the structures in c jumping through hoops with casting but you can provde a family of functions that your users do what they need to do without accessing the contents of the abstract types for example our family of functions might look like disc const char int file disc program disc const char disc int int program track program const char program int unsigned char int unsigned long offset track should all be reasonably self explanantory it is modelled on the existing standard c file your user obtains a ptr to disc with assuming this works will return null if it he can obtain any global disc information with more to the point he can obtain a ptr to a progam within the disc with one of the family of a ptr to program he can drill down further and obtain a single track with one of the family of very important point is that you make your user iterate through the audio fragments himself to get data from the the user provides a buffer to read the samples and you iterate as necessary through the fragments to fill that the function is provided to give him random tried to work out the details of every parameter and how errors are handled i am just presenting a concept to be that the paradigm is used an introductory and a concluding sandwiches operations on every

exactly does not deleting in the context of an avl could mean you do work on which is to you update the tree at will cause the tree to rebalance because the upward scan for balance factors will be working with incorrect balance could mean updating the balance factors but not means you would end when you did decide to delete with balance factors greater than 2 or smaller than which implies multiple rotations to the problem here though is that you can no longer upon a whether or not eliminated a subtree because although you know there are say 3 subtree depths too many on one you no longer know exactly one element which is causing each level of that extra depth something you normally know because adding or removing single elements at a time so you have no idea how many rotations you need to you might do three rotations and only have lost one subtree because there were two elements at that in how would you even be able to which elements to rotate to get at the necessary they necessarily all exist in the path from your chosen delete element and the point where the balance factor is not but go out on a limb and say lazy deletes breaks avl as we know would you want to the whole point of avl is to amortize the rebalance cost across each so you stay at why build up rebalance debt for less frequent

feature was in they defaulted to nullable references and used to indicate this was because they wanted backward my dream language which probably be the only make the same choice as by would also make it illegal to use the operator on a nullable reference anything else that would dereference how would you use have to convert them to how would you do by testing them for java and the statement can only accept a test extend it to accept the name of a nullable reference in this myobj is so can be special syntax would be unsurprising to prefer a special syntax like this to make it clear that we are doing a check that modifies the type of the name within the add a further bit of into anotherobj is so can be just gives the name to the result of the expression on the left of the so it can be used in the scope where it is do the same kind of thing for the message into m m message that is but so are the two possible results of the test so the assignment is then maybe a bit of sugar for the presumably common case of substituting a value for message or message would only be validly applied to a nullable type on the left and a on the right also have a notion of ownership for instance the compiler would generate the method and the syntax would be used to augment exactly as in had another syntactic extension related to due to the problem of ensuring that had been initialized correctly during private public other you have to initialize fields in the same way as call other constructors with or unless of course you initialize them directly next to the field

feel the editor question has been fully many of the answers relating to that are very so allow me to discuss text editors from a bit of a wider standpoint i will admit my i use os i like i use i like emacs i like ides that and i like using closed source even though i admit that i never look very deep into the source code of what i i will one i definitive text editors for linux are and both of which are quite often used from the but both of which have quite wonderful graphical i personally am a vim but with a gui that suits my native environment i really like emacs especially for i personally find vim easier to both as a command line editor and as an whereas i never got the feel for emacs as a command line as a both emacs and vim are readily avaliable for and are almost ubiquitous on both have syntax highlighting for most major and are fully so that you can find syntax definitions for many or even write your own fairly i suggest you look at both of them a little and find the one you like the and learn it emacs is open source under the gnu and vim is open source under a charityware license that asks you to feed the children in but that is still very lot of people will extol the merits of the ide for especially in eclipse is a unlike vim and emacs which have little overhead and allow you to write a quick shell script as easily as a large and some find that a bit cumbersome for their but it suits others very it depends where you in web you could go either being more in the unix i tend to prefer leaner text editors to large but some from a windows background prefer the features of eclipse has good syntax highlighting for as well as a number of other popular languages languages very similar in syntax to expect good c and and possibly good perl and php eclipse is open source under a license with weaker copyleft provisions than the and is more whatever that is an amazing text editor for i really enjoyed using it when i had to do small amounts of work on and it made the time i spent on a windows box almost enjoyable fully admit my bias it works well with the overall windows almost as well as os x programs work and it supports a of languages i can only attest to the quality of the only in my largest drawback is that it is only avaliable for you can theoretically get it to work on linux with but i say that wine is ever the best solution to a problem like this if it works for go for is open source under the gnu people like my biggest beef with visual studio is that it is closed but i personally tried it because i almost never use so i can neither extol its virtues nor condemn its sure a great i just like ides and i like closed source some consider it the best editor on so i completely not mention all i can say is ask someone else about is getting so going to go ahead and post this is by no means a definitive list of text editors avaliable for windows and just a rundown of some of the more popular ones that aware if anyone notices that forgotten anything just comment and probably add

forms is very much a part of the framework and cannot be accessed least not in any practical from unmanaged it is possible to call it from managed know about designer support in visual studio but managed can definitely use the windows forms might want to look into other gui such as or	
formula is more factor is the per entry maps are typically implemented as these are binary so there will be at least two pointers for the there will also be some implementation stuff probably a parent pointer and a so factor may be something like rbnode 3 all this is highly implementation dependent to find out for sure you really need to examine the code for your own library	
fortran very common to use j and k as loop control variables in a do i still use j and k when writing for loops in or whatever language coding even though i written a single line of fortran for over 10 often make comments about it but i refuse to accept that there are better loop control variable i also feel the compulsion to rewrite other for loops to use j and k because the code looks too verbose	
forwarding allows you to relocate a type between so originally it is in by applying you can end with in subtlety is the that is already see the change they ask for the type in and the runtime silently gives them the type from this is very important if you have existing code cannot be recompiled referencing without you referencing clients need to be you do need to rebuild both and in the above code any recompiled must now reference new

found a rough description of the file format it looks like there is quite a mix of variable types and sizes which is going to complicate things i know if using fortran to try and read this data is the best but if you must here are some the file for direct access unformatted unformatted means that you can just read the bytes straight out of the and direct access add any padding to the record length as the lowest common length between the function to interpret a location in memory as a particular this will allow you to read the binary data from the file into a variable of type but then assign to a without doing a type in a similar situation now trying to read a file with a structure very similar to the dbase file varying sizes of headers pointing to regions of the file with different and ended up using python and numpy to read the reading consists of to a location in the reading a bunch of then using the option to convert that into you can make this but you may want to keep your options

from a desktop client with no real web design i am studying ui design to determine the best ui pattern for always tend to experiment with presentation when learning a new ui so that is where i have started thinking i should use i am studying the various ways of architecting a ui form which contains a master list of parent and then showing the related children records in a second grid on the page when you click on a even the child records are parents to other so need to deal with that customers with open orders open orders for selected customer line items on selected open like this screen where i built the same thing in of techniques seen simply creates a plain table of href links for the with some method call to query the children based on the selected while some techniques seen use the data controls to work all this are the data controls do real developers use these box or do they output their own html so they can have more it seems like mvc is all the rage right so i though i should consider when i looked at a few about it seems to take a step back in time as it looks like you have to manually create much the html to present lists and rather than being able to use the kinda lost as to where to spend my practice for parent child ui design in

from the world of and learning been wondering about get and set functions in in usage of these are quite and tools like visual studio promote usage by making them very easy and quick to this seem to be the case in the the class private string public string get return set bar in class foo people will well whats the point in why not just create a public field and then make it a property later if you need actually not i just do it out of good practice because seen it done so many because so used to doing i feel like i should carry over the habit to my but is this really i see it done as often as with the from what i thanks for the tip void return i always wonder if using is good to me that seems like a whole lot of leg considering using visual tools the implementation would take literally seconds to and the took me a lot longer to type i feel its not worth the especially when the alternative is 5 lines what i these are the can change implementation details for the get and set so instead of returning a private field you can return something more can remove a later on and make it only for a public facing this not the ages to is this worth the generally in some the advantages make it worth the but i speaking in terms of is did i choose answer with less i was actually very close to choosing however my personal opinion is apparently is that the answer over egged the answer i on the other seems to argue both i think getters and setters evil if used excessively that i when not necessary and would break the business but why we have a function called this would be far more versatile than what if i wanted to show it to the user in another way than as the class wanted me in some sense may not be relevant enough to argue that and setters are because it have an accompanying and speaking of a function called could be bad my because it would imply to the implementer of the function that the account must be manipulated out side of the which is not a good get and set functions popular with

general answer is you are not guaranteed that for the same numeric the long objects you get are the same if you restrict yourself to using it is possible that you would get a performance improvement by first trying to test the equality of references and if trying it all hinges on the comparative costs of the additional test and the method your mileage may but it is worth trying a simple loop test to see which is	
general rule of thumb here is that server roundtrips are expensive to how long a typical query so the guiding principle is that you want to minimize basically each join will potentially multiply your result set so the way i approach this is to keep joining until the result set gets too large or the query execution time gets too long seconds on your platform you may or may not be able to execute queries in this is a key determinant in what you should do because if you can only execute one query at a time the barrier to breaking up a query is that much worth keeping certain relatively constant data in memory for or doing them as a separately query but this in my reasonably more common is having to fix up systems with awful performance due in large part to doing separate queries correlated instead of

going to try to explain the best i can arrays in their fundamental so an array is basically a way to store for instance if you want a list of shopping we would use a one dimensional index holds a specific the data as you can see are represented as now i use something like this will put an integer as index the compiler will tell you that no good and you need to fix that on to matrices or take a piece of squared paper like the ones you use for math and draw a cartesian system and some put the coordinates on different piece of paper and next to them put a for this means is that at index i have a representation would be like system in form of a matrices 1 1 0 0 0 0 used just simple arrays to illustrate what are for example if you want to go 3d the data structure for that would be a array of matrices aka a list which holds each cartesian location at a specific we had as height and the same dots as above it would be something you want a way to grab a simple list of problems and try to implement them using arrays of any there is no quick way to do just have patience and

good would only add data this might even be easier in because if is with oop is trying to encourage you to take every noun verb in your head and turn it into a class that can be very suppose you have an array of temperature readings at points in and you want to display them as a in windows has a paint and when you receive you can loop through the array doing lineto scaling the data as you go to convert it to pixel i have seen entirely too many times since the chart consists of points and people will build up a data structure consisting of point objects and line each capable of and then make that on the theory that that is somehow or that they just have to be able to mouse over parts of the chart and display the data so they build methods into the objects to deal with and of involves creating and deleting even more you end up with a huge amount of code that is and merely spends of time managing of this gets done in the name of programming and least in c the efficient way will be more and the temptation to build pyramids less

gstring concept in groovy is pretty powerful let you do things hello program trying to figure out if using groovy can introduce security problems in your code similar to sql injection the example above the code was written by the author of the so the execution of the command cannot be seen as a security flaw as it was the stated intent of the say writing a grails where user input is taken from form fields and database tables assume that an attacker controls both sent as requests to the server and in the code in my app looks like str1 str2 here is some and there any way an attacker can execute code in the above why my initial hypothesis is that gstring usage is always please feel free to prove me please be as concrete as to keep the discussion please disregard any problems in the code since this question is about on the not on the some people have pointed out that it is a good idea to filter out unwanted while filtering out bad might certainly save you from some classes of security it would be even better to write code that would be safe even without you can compare it with usage of preparedstatements in the java jdbc api correct usage of preparedstatements is to save you from certain classes of injection filtering your sql input will probably give you the same but using preparedstatements strictly dominates the filtering approach use of in	
guard against infinite you can observe the instruction count as the script runs works only with interpreted not with compiled is this in the rhino to prevent a script from running for more than ten protected void int mycontext mcx long currenttime if more then 10 seconds from context creation it is time to stop the throw error instance to ensure that script will get control back through catch or throw new	
gues something better that waits for the nib to be loaded but and application specific things like global is the right uiview specific you typically use the method in a uiviewcontroller it is pretty much the only place you are guaranteed that the nib file is the iboutlets are initialized and the ibactions are is difference from the mac os x where was the place to do	
guess depend on the hardware and toolchain port for that specific have the for most embedded i have seen people chucking out two things handling does make use of both in most so there is a tendency to throw it out as those cases where we really want to get close to the are that this the best solution possible very but then what can run simple tests on your desktop with two versions of a benchmarking suite exception handling and get the data that you can rely on thing about embedded templates are avoided like the plague they cause too much exceptions tag along templates and rtti as explained by johann gerell in the comments assumed this was well this is just what we what is it with all the	
guess if checking the availability on every page compute how many free rooms by grabbing how many bookings are in effect at the current from reservations will give you your current rooms that are then simply subtract this value from a might help to normalize the database by having a customer and individual room table with a linking table to the booking however i am unaware of your

guess the answer depends on where you want the red as part of the navigation bar or just under that would be only 1 pixel but designers are demanding these days you want it below the navigation bar you definitely have to put it in all of the views where the line is a surprisingly simple way to alter the look of the navigation i used it for skinning the entire navbar look but it will probably work for even only some parts of the navbar if you make the image partially we want to skin the of a in your navigation a 320x44 image containing your custom navbar a to the where the the property of the to the almost except that the title view will be resized in wierd to fix that i have a subclass that keeps the image properly 0 instead of using a above use this

guess this is more a question about coding style than you have a straightforward with no there is little reason to mark the termination of the program by anything is not going to return anything that anybody can since your program ends is just going to exit with status which would happen naturally if the structure is more i would advise to the termination point by something to signal to someone who reads your code for that defined set of there is nothing to take into account there would use rather than for the simple reason that return can be mistaken for the end of a whereas exit very specifically states that the program at this

guess you are using i am having the same sporadically i would find this exception in my event and the requested path is always fixed validationkey and decryptionkey in machinekey did not fix the problem for on what i was able to i tend to believe that this error has nothing to do with the viewstate my theory is that for some certain uas somehow mess up the parameter of the the problem is easily replicable by requesting the offending path this gives an even though viewstate even apply through my i found for request is served ok slightly different request is also served ok request fails with a 500 response and the invalid viewstate you look the first few characters on all three request are the but the last few characters of the last request clearly is control id have a controls named products and i know how this id got but in my case this is what is causing all these invalid viewstate not sure whether this is the same case as the op or but i notice request url ends in which is a bit of a coincidence for a parameter that is supposed to be a already have a headache thanks to this and so the most insightful post i came across is this one

guessing its while hashset implements isreadonly has no meaning for in if you reflect the property always returns implementing it explicitly hides this method from the public reason is because the icollection interface may be implemented because of incidental reasons to support xaml rather than because its necessary to the primary use of the so implementing it explicitly can keep the clutter out of the	
guessing the problem is that the in your code is a ui updates are not but must run through the message queue in windows and then be painted to the the queue is pumped and painting takes place in the same thread as your a any tasks need to be moved to a different more than your line line of code needs to called after that thread otherwise you set the progress bar and then immediately turn it off way to do that is with a backgroundworker	
guessing you already know if the you really should look at which lets you easily use managed code from the code shown above really very should completely avoid	
guessing you have control over the other two if you this be too could just have them listen to a socket and see if the socket is available when you come next solution may actually be language you could manage the whole system through batch file write a batch file that creates a file when it starts up and deletes it when it unix systems use this technique a call the file a lock file more often than only your app will ever start these other then you could simply track if started it or so guessing this possible or you be so assuming that the user may have launched these programs through some other you have no control over the launching of the other apps and even write a batch file to launch then you just do what you want to do the apps would have to always use the batch even if the user started them by just a ditch effort might be to get a process status and parse but have to know exactly what the other apps were called in the this really all java apps tend to have the same exact signature in most process status printouts which could make this problem is that if one of these programs were started outside your you have virtually no way to identify that fact unless you happen to know exact process status and even then

had an issue similar to this where a code bug was silent in msvc2k5 but if you had the msvc2k5 sp2 runtime installed it caused an error which point at valid of the problem when you start executing data as code you could be doing anything and so the crash location becomes useless as you cannot even get back to a valid stack had this happen to us when the new runtime install installed a newer version of the msvc runtime in the sxs the end our method to resolve the issue was to make the crash happen frequently and add as much logging as necessary to localize

had several positions where had complete ownership of the this involved me doing all and also supervised the use case writing to make sure it was all this is by far the best approach to ensure but it might not always be the most practical would be to write but this is not really the same thing as having a good gui design at least it can teach developers to use custom that your company might must is a dictionary that contains the domain language your ase using and how it should be used in the this is one of the most important things that a lead gui developer needs to the very least you should make sure that you review anything that is done by other developers unlessy you know and trust them to do the right gui design is often a vastly under estimated skill and it is important to remember that not everyone can do it without proper

had the same issue and it was absolutely what the docs say on the mysql website the driver try to stale dead enabled the driver will throw an exception for a queries issued on a stale or dead which belong to the current but will attempt reconnect before the next query issued on the connection in a new the use of this feature is not because it has side effects related to session state and data consistency when applications do not handle sqlexceptions and is only designed to be used when you are unable to configure your application to handle sqlexceptions resulting from dead and stale connections investigate setting the mysql server variable to some high value rather than the default of 8 my it seem like the on the next functionality worked but i was using mysql which may have been the reason for ended up writing a that catches the checks for that specific and attempts to reconnect and retry the query if provides a bit more and indicates that autoreconnect will probably be removed in the future

have an interesting problem which been looking into and would appreciate some trying to create a tool which mimics the basic capabilities of a requirements management tool as part of a company basic design is a windows setting of folders and documents can be opened in a and document itself contains a hierarchical spreadsheet of excel with if that makes any each chapter contains which are really just some requirements text some other values which complement when the requirement text and attribute values show up as independent columns like with filtering the for this type of program is pretty but where i get hung up on is the document content biggest concern is size and how it relates to as part of this i not only intended to store the current state of each but also the entire list of changes that have been made since day 1 like and then provide fast access to the history of i expect documents in the each document will probably have active over the course of a not unreasonable to assume edits each document itself will acquire an additional rows and by the number of that amounts to nearly rows an additional the next and the next and so old histories can be but it would only be performed by an admin not preferable that do i see there are two ways for me to handle this can try to represent a list all rows of all documents in a single table like how phpbb stores all posts of all forums in a single can try to store the rows of each document in a uniquely named table each document has own the table would have to be given a unique and a master table would contain the list of all documents and the table names that correspond to my which really is are neither really good can anyone offer advice on which approach you would find more given the sql tables on the fly as new content is uploaded a bad

have been dropping hints at a version of office with an integrated vsto in the same way as the vb6 ide is integrated for so the vs ide would be integrated for ever since was first just how much coding is involved and given that this would not produce any features that would be visible to users i very much doubt that this is high on the microsoft priority i can imagine that they layer a managed code set of objects over the top of the existing codebase as joel spolsky layered a set of com objects over the existing c codebase when putting vba into excel in the first and bung a new ide in as the while hiding the old even that would be a major exercise writing the macro of this would make a for which the office team will only accept at will never actually remove vba from the of course excel still supports excel 4 and word still has the wordbasic automation object to support word 6 and no sign of either of those being since there is too much legacy code to support and has used either of those coding models in a microsoft do ever put a environment into office i doubt will ever then they might stop adding vba support for new office the closest get to discontinuing

have implemented so far 3 variants for the sweep algorithm for detecting the intersection of a planar closed i have big data that represent the graph 200 edges or the vertices are pairs of points in 2d the edges are a pair of two one being the source the other being the which is read from another function implemented in a library for some other problem is that the 3 implementation work fine on integers or doubles data that are not as but when i tried anyone of these 3 implementations on my datas representing the graph i got different result each time and not even the good i have all the intersections that i want but some other points from the graph are not i have some points from the graph as result but some intersections that i need are missing from the computed i have just the intersections all depends on the sort function that i had i saw and maybe on something else but i cannot figure it the sort function orders the edges of the graph as two edges as and or and and thought this sort function is good for monoticity and other cases but apparently it is working only for some cases when besides the regular intersections it detects some other intersections for some cases it does work at all in that it does not computes all the intersections but just some point from the you in

have to understand three related windows stations and but because a relationships between sessions and we can broadly ignore stations for this a session contains a station being the only interactive and stations contain one or more session architecture differs according to windows for nt 5 and everything before services execute in session 0 along with the interactive this is why you can configure services to interact with the desktop in these windows nt versions they are in the same for nt 6 server 2008 going services exists in session 0 but the interactive desktop is in another this is known as and is basically a security since session 0 apps cannot get at the interactive it makes no sense for them to attempt to display a user interface of any to make this more vista has a temporary kludge to cater for this if an app in session 0 tries to create a windows will trap this and present a warning to the user so they switch to a presume desktop where they can interact with the however this measure is explicitly temporary and you cannot rely upon it being in future windows seen this working in native but i suspect you are in managed code and the runtime is being smart enough to catch your behaviour and deliver a metaphorical slap to the hindquarters

have used the database testing that is built into visual studio 2008 database edition on a project it works but feels more like a third party to visual studio than a native some of the pains i felt with it sql code lives in the res files and a single code file can include multiple it is not as easy to search for tests based on multiple tests live in the same code you have some annoying variable name collisions if you have two tests in a single code all of the assertions for those tests have to have unique that means your assertion names will probably look like which really be your tests is not easy for if you want to move a test from one code file to the easiest way is to create the test from scratch in the new file because there are bits and pieces of the test scattered about the res file and the code of that as i started with it does work we have not added these tests to our continuous integration server so i comment on how easy it is to automate the running of these we are using tfs for and i am assuming that automation of the tests would work very similar to automation of standard unit in other it seems like there should be an mstest command line that would run the this is only an option if you are licensed to run visual studio 2008 db edition i understand is now included in the vs 2008 pro

hbase documentation makes it clear that you should group similar columns into column because the physical storage is done by column what does it mean to put two column families into the same as opposed to having separate tables per column are there specific cases when tables this way makes more and cases when one table works tables should result in separate which could be beneficial when some column families a are very when would it be advantageous to have columns families bunched spreading column families across tables or

headers is the origin server sending back with your in order to be cacheable by i believe you generally have to specify either a or etag in the response web servers will typically do this automatically for static but if your content is being dynamically served if from a static then you have to ensure they are and handle request headers such as and since i got pointed to this question by your subsequent question about is there a header coming out in the for tells caches that the content can vary according to the cookie header in the so static content wants to have that but your web server might be adding that to all requests if there is a regardless of the nature of the data being my some experimentation with the http headers to see what the effects are on caching is of great i remember finding that the solutions were not always

honestly surprised at those a computationally intensive product i would place a large wager on c to perform you might write code that leaks memory like a and has interesting threading related but it should be only reason i could think that java or would be faster is due to a short run length on the if little or no gc avoid the overhead of actually deallocating if the process is iterative or try sticking a wherever you think done a bunch of setting things to null or otherwise removing if dealing with terabytes of my opinion is going to be much better off with deterministic memory allocation that you get with if you deallocate roughly close to when you allocate your heap will stay largely with a gc environment you may very well end up with your program using far more memory after a decent run length than you would just because of me this sounds like the sort of project where c would be the appropriate but would require a bit of extra attention to memory my bet is that or java will fail if run on a full data

how would you tackle the described simple flat queries will be made on specific retrieve rows describing have partition based on entity each file of data is can then read all of the files in a given part of the directory to return samples for someone wants a relational then load files for a given into a database for their on day uniqueness rule is something that has to be trivially imposed on the file names and irrelevant for mean anything no so no need to rename the should simply grow without bound from the epoch if you want to purge old then delete the old no query relies on nothing ever needs to be done with it can be the file name for all that it include the in the result write it in the file with the other four attributes that are in each row of the on you have to leave the you do periodic flushes to assure that stuff really is going to have two choices for the architecture of your a single process that consolidates the data from the various this is helpful if queries are relatively you pay for merging the data at write several files open concurrently for when merge these files into a single this is helpful is queries are relatively you pay for merging the data at query

i believe the misinformation strings being immutable have nothing with if someone already has access to the objects in a running application would have to be assumed if you are trying to guard against someone a string in your they would certainly be a plenty of other opportunities available for a quite novel idea that the immutability of string is addressing threading hmmm i have an object that is being changed by two different how do i resolve synchronize access to the naawww not let anyone change the object at all fix all of our messy concurrency in make all objects and then we can removed the synchonized contruct from the java real reason out by others is memory it is quite common in any application for the same string literal to be used it is so in that decades many compilers made the optimization of storing only a single instance of a string the drawback of this optimization is that runtime code that modifies a string literal introduces a problem because it is modifying the instance for all other code that shares for it would be not good for a function somewhere in an application to change the string literal to a would result in being written to for that there needed to be a way of guarding against code that attempts to change string literals make them some compilers support from the would accomplish this by placing string literal into a special readonly memory segment that would cause a memory fault if a write attempt was java this is known as the java compiler here is just following an standard memory optimization done by compilers for and to address the same issue of these string literals being modified at java simply makes the string class immutable gives you no setters that would allow you to change the string strings would not have to be immutable if interning of string literals did not

i expect that any pointer in user space programs lies in a safe distance from the addresses 0 and so that i can safely add a small offset to the pointer without checking for an what is the largest positive n for which i can safely assume that p n overflow when p is a char pointer into a constant character buffer or a dynamically allocated string a modern operating avoid talking about not about bounds for if you have a pointer p to the beginning of a string with m chars and you want to access the char at the positive offset then you either need to check that i m or you can check indirectly p i p in the latter case you also have to make sure that p i you have to make sure that p i p i is not valid standard c if i regardless of whether p i is actually dereferenced or whether it the question really interested in is whether there is a small n for which p n overflow answering this question obviously requires some knowledge about how modern operating systems organize the address it would already be very interesting to hear about any one particular even if not preferably not some obscure embedded x86 or linux and mac would be most is smallest offset for which i can safely omit overflow checking when i add it to a

i finally figured out a working the for updating this is mainly because must run within a you can try running it within the existing but that is probably tied to the same persistence context of the entity what this means is that after you update you have to find a way to the the easy way is to call but this results in all sorts of side effects about it in the jpa the better solution is to get the underlying delegate my a hibernate and call this will probably work on simple domain but mine were very i was never able to get to work correctly with my existing jpa like i also tried manually passing my domain graph a and having each parent entity evict its this also work for unknown was left in a situation where only would but i accept the side i then tried creating a separate persistence unit specifically for entity i figured i could localize the operation to only that pc in charge of i set up a new a new corresponding a new transaction manager for and manually injecting this transaction manager into the repository for manual wrapping of the in a transaction corresponding to the proper here i have to say that i know enough about container managed because it ended up being a nightmare trying to get the transaction for to play nicely with the container managed transaction getting pulled in from the service this point i threw out everything and created this class jdbcuserconversionrepository implements userconversionrepository userservice jdbctemplate user user final class update the user set where new before we try to load our converted user back into the we need to remove them from the pc so the try to load the cached one in the keep in mind that of the child entities of this user will remain in the this normally cause a problem when the pc is throwing a entity in this specific we return a new reference which replaces the old this means if we just evict then remove all references to the pc will not be able drill down into the children and try to persist reload the converted user into the persistence return public void datasource new are two important parts of this method which i believe make it marked it with should suspend the container managed transaction coming in from the service layer and allow the conversion to take place external of the trying to reload the converted entity back into the i evict the old copy currently stored in the pc with the code for this is simply getting a instance and calling see the comments in code for more but basically if we do this any calls to will try to return the cached entity still in the except that it will throw an error about the type being my initial tests have gone this solution may still have some i will keep this updated as they are

i first posted this question i had strong coupling between my web service and application controller where the controller needed to open multiple threads to the service and as it received back data it had to do a lot of processing on the returned data and merge it into one i did not like the fact that the client had to so much processing and merge the returned data before it was ready to be used and wanted to move that layer to the service and let the service open the asynchronous threads to the suppliers and merge the results before returning them to the challenge i had was that i could not wait till all threads were complete and results were i had to start receiving data as it was that called me to implement an observer pattern on the service so that it would notify my application when new set of results are merged and ready to be used and send them to the was looking for how to do this using either on asmx webservices or wcf and so far i have found implementing it using wcf but this thread is always open for suggestions and observer pattern using

i misread the and thought that it was a duplicate of but the 100mbps makes it completely very modest hardware should be able to saturate a 100mbps connection with no problems particularly if using 1440 byte udp suggested by the figures do look suspiciously like a 10mbps rather than i would check all of the links from end to end to make sure that they are at the 100mbps that you believe them to any 10mbps link in that chain is going to be a on the equipment that using you may find that there have been issues with link some equipment is notoriously so you may find better results by turning autonegotiation and forcing the link speeds to as you have a pcap file that i would suggest trying to do some speed there are several options that tcpreplay provides to replay files at the highest possible look at wiki that gives you different results than seeing at the moment it could point to a problem with the pcap for the pcap files do contain timing information that can be used when replaying the if the timing in your pcap file was taken from a 10mbps network then replaying it in real time will give you the result that

i recently wrote a review of using several major ides with eclipse and visual studio and ironpython not a big fan of ironpython studio not really production quality in my the designers target ironpython 1 and the generated code require changes to run them on their own with having to modify generated code is never use the designers with visual studio to generate and then subclass in ironpython to actually implement the working with ironpython any of the python ides will be i like wing because the autocomplete is the best seen in a python you can also teach it to do autocomplete for libraries generating pi working with wing personal is free but the professional version is set your interpreter in the project settings to be though because you lose the interactive shell inside wing which is very useful for trying things means that you need external tools to run your launch your but using the wing scripting api or the os tools to integrate these tools into wing is emacs are all editors ides with python integration and will all work very well which you prefer depends on your tastes and you have any other requirements for an general ironpython development i use msbuild to provide build wix for building pyc compiler to compile to binary and a custom executable for the project that is very thin wrapper around the ironpython hosting api written in an editor ide is only one of the tools used and a general python ide should serve you i recently wrote a review of using several major ides with ironpython

i take into web to mean that just learning web programming in if if you have the time you might consider setting java aside temporarily and giving a closer look as eddie personally use perl instead of php is sexier resume fodder and lets you do some very cool things on the front but in my when it comes to writing code perl simply blows doors and heard that the extension puts perl on pretty even footing with but i used it made a living writing writing web apps in java and web apps in fond of both but as a learning put perl well ahead of as finding a bulky part of that as others have a function of java being a mature language with a variety of extensions that are unlikely to apply to your immediate but even stripped still need to deal with quite a bit of overhead before you can even get your first web app to get rolling much quicker with java tends to be pretty verbose in general compared with other not necessarily a bad my one big complaint with perl is you often encounter code that leverages various shortcuts and side effects to do an unholy ton of work in just a few this code is often and utterly bloody unintelligible to a terseness is not a virtue for the poor idiot who has to modify code six months after it was written especially when you wind up being the poor idiot in as a way of learning web sophistication can actually work against as a glad tools automagically take care of a lot of grunt work for like session but i completely what it was doing until i was thrown into a environment and had to deal with all that stuff guess it depends on why doing this and how much time you can devote to if time is limited and looking for something that will appeal to prospective then an excellent and gotten some solid advice in this thread about how to get started using if you do have the i highly recommend giving programming a it a particularly marketable skillset but learn things worth

i think i think this is very subjective but also i agree with your you i compared a pattern against one big function cascading the latter is but it is many times easier to parameters to the recursive calls is only a problem if need that degree of i find i do in i think you could make the go away with an application of for say the cascading ifs is more if i understand you i they be more i doubt flexible is is spaghetti code really easy to modify without invoking fears of i broken i rarely worry about whether another implementation of an interface will break existing code as much as i worry about breaking spaghetti code with minor the point of all this the point is not just just use all these patterns and polymorphism because it is the idea is to be more flexible and i think clarity is a side effect of that as there might be some amount of cases where just adding an extra is but i say that is we might be using different defintion of	
i think probably not considering the use of messaging an mom instance or any other mom on a case really make sense best to think of your mom broker as a router of that you would have one activemq broker instance might be sharded or otherwise scaled if you have scaling or replicated if you have ha which all producers and all consumers connect then all xml goes to the same broker and all consumers read from the same broker in that the broker will determine which consumer the message should go to based on any heuristics it also means that you can add and remove producers and consumers and nothing ever they all connect to the same so you can add and remove producers and consumers as your load changes or as systems

i think you are approaching this pun not intended with an unnecessary degree of i think this unnecessary level of abstraction is what is causing the you are perhaps approaching this from a mathematical theoretical where many of us are approaching this from a trying to solve i believe this difference in approach is causing the programmers look at practicalities and how to actually there are a number of times when you need some totally arbitrary object whose actual instance is totally it just cannot be the example i gave in a comment to another post is the implementation of or or type of which is commonly done by using a backing and using the keys as the you often cannot use as the so what is commonly done is to use a static instance as the which will be ignored and never some placeholder is common use is with the keyword where is needed to synchronize and you want to ensure that your synchronizing item is totally private to avoid deadlock where different classes are unintentionally synchronizing on the same a very common idiom is to allocate a final to use in a class as the to be as of java 5 and and related this idiom is measurably less it has been quite useful in java to have be you could make a good point that with small changes in design or with small api this would no longer be probably correct in the api could have provided a class that extends without adding anything at to be used as a placeholder for the purposes described but if extending but adding what is the value in the class other than allowing to be perhaps one could find a but what value would it add to do are times in programming where you need an concrete object that is not something that you can compare via but you just need any other feature to this it exists only to serve as a unique identifier and otherwise does absolutely satisfies this role perfectly and very would guess that is part of the reason why was not declared it is directly useful for it not to

i understand a video file is a collection of static image you can use this api from which essentially shows you the mechanism of capturing the so what you may have to do automatically capture images in a loop according to a set frame rate and then export it to a not sure of how to create a media but you have the library to do the screen

i understand it this is a problem you wish to load images from an internet url instead of a local this means that you have to have some way of listing the files available at the remote if you look at the problem you will realize that the only difference between retrieving images from a remote location and from your local system is that the files are easily enumerable using the directoryinfo the method here returns an array of and you can get the actual filename for each using the filename so you need a list of strings that map to the location of the enumerating the files from a remote location alone depends on many factors such as the protocol you are using to retrieve that if using and we can assume that you have some control over the server at that then the url would need to primarily support directory you will then need to parse that served directory list is and server and load all the available image as you can then populate your repeater with that see for a possible the server supports then you work becomes easier because you can enumerate the images using the or if you want to create thumbnails for the you will have to write code to download each save it in a temporary location and then perform dimensional manipulations upon if the list of images available at the internet location is static and you already have that you can simply load that list as a list of strings and set each image src property to that the thumbnails will however remain a unless you can upload your thumbnail creator http at that url so that files are retrieved locally for manipulation and thumbnails are served to you

i understand the question mark wants to see an overview of all the last results for each means for every result he only wants to see only one and that is the result which has last been added for that think the easiest way to achieve would be to create an additional which we can call for class public int resultid public int resulttypeid public datetime resultdate class should not be but nhibernate should be aware that this class have to import we can create an icriteria which will populate instances of myresultoverview which will also generate the most efficient sql query in order to get this should look something like criteria results should give you a list of myresultoverview instances which represent the myresults that looking in order to retrieve the myresult you can simply do this by retrieving the myresult instance for that particalur resultid that retrieved as tested nor did i compile but this is the path that i would follow to achieve

i was talking with a friend of mine who had started a class a couple months ago first exposure to we got onto the topic of and and he made the point to me that he felt it was for all of the issues breakable i agreed with him on all those but i held back in saying it was only because i felt in languages like could instead become native code microsoft so chose to change the implementation of from a jit runtime environemnent to one which compiles directly to native code like your program question am i out to lunch i it may take a lot of work may break too many but there some type of magical barrier which prevents code from being compiled natively one wanted to do there was a time where was considered a very language it still but not as much as in the yet now the bedrock with for native the idea that could one day be on the same level as in that respect seems only to be a matter of time and effort to not some fundamental flaw in the design of the i should add that if native compilation of is why does microsoft choose not to go that why have they chosen the jit bytecode managed code ever become

i was too late on the answer for this but i was working a little test scenario that seems to have worked very well for i used a but and regular expression to locate all the words for the expression is as here with line breaks for formatting my method was to execute this regex with a library like and then read back the named and it worked on all of the different examples listed in this minus the as i add them but as you can it be hard to do this addresses a lot of for it addresses the following items in the original question and other or and spelling that it does not explicitly address that would be something want to do before you passed the string to this this parser sees this example as 2100 one and also thousand and one hundred fifty but also or and also is not totally as what is this code finds this number as simply rather than store this monster of a regular expression in your i was considering building this regex at using something like the so easy part here is we are only storing the words that in the case of notice that there an entry for because just normal number with th tacked but ones like twelve need different so now we have the code to build our now we just execute it on our number thing i would is to or eat the word not and only leads to other what you are going to want to do is setup a function that passes the named matches for into a function that looks at all the possible magnitude and multiplies your current result by that value of you create a function that looks at the named and returns an int whatever you are based on the value discovered value matches are added to your while magnitutde matches multiply the result by the mag two hundred fifty thousand becomes then then then ending up with for i wrote a vbscript version of this and it worked great with all the examples it support named so i had to work a little harder getting the correct but i got bottom line if a add it your if a magnitude multiply your accumulator by this will provide you with some pretty amazing and all you have to do to adjust for things like is add them to your put in a code marker for and handle i hope this post helps someone out if anyone i can post by vbscript pseudo code that i used to test this not pretty and not production i what is the final language this will be written or something like a scripted greg source will go a long way in helping understand how all of this comes me know if i can be of any other i only know so i help you with the other

idea of types is to let the compiler rather than your client find suppose you add to your language two type specifiers be and using the java annotation you define a you annotate its for the following code will foo if return return though foo may be null at the the flow of control guarantees when you call foo is if you remove the check for you will get a following will compile too because foo is nonnull at the foo return you be able to call g with a nullable foo compiler compiler does flow analysis for every so it can detect when becomes inside an if statement that checks for it will also accept a veriable definition provided it is immediately foo foo new much more on this topic in	
identified yourself as unfamiliar with the subtleties of floating point refer you to this fine paper by david every computer scientist should know about at been scared by the reality is that of the time floating point is a huge boon to getting calculations and modern compilers and languages handle conversions sensibly so that you have to worry about unless you points raised about precision are certainly an effectively has only 24 bits of which is less than a use of for intermediate calculations will push all rounding and precision loss out to the conversion back to or

if this is obvious or covered but been googling all day and found a solution that actually problem is as i am currently drawing an image in a full screen for examples sake say the image is in the bottom right corner of the like to do a rotation at the center of that by default the rotation command rotates around the center of the uiview it as a my image moves around the screen when i rotate instead of it staying in place and rotating around its own what i need to translate my context so that the of the is at the center of my and then restore the context by translating back to the original following is the closest thing gotten to but the problem is that while the image is it moves downward while i think this is caused by animation tweening the 1st step translate and 3rd step translate instead of just realizing that the beginning and end point on the translates would be the before this make a call to a function that draws a path to a passed in inversetranslation transy translation rot final rot translation then i apply the transformation animation like normal using final etc also tried stuff like cgcontexttranslatectm and but these seem to have little been fighting with this for days and my current solution seems but i have no clue how to get rid of that translating does anyone have a solution for this or a better way to go about the time being drawing my image centered at the center and then setting the property to the origin like to rotate and then doing the rotate seems like a bit of a but until i can get the real translates working my only i move the origin when doing a rotation transform in quartz 2d for the

in many i am designing a database that should keep record of previous versions of the rows changed in each standard solution to this problem is to keep a history table for each data whenever a row needs to be updated in the data a copy of the current row gets inserted to the history table and than the row in the data table gets disadvantages of this solution for of 2 tables instead of case the structure of the table needs application needs to know both of the tables instead of of the tables might need to be short to keep a convention of the table name and the history table name for am considering a different solution and would like to know if each we add the column a row gets inserted to the it will get inserted with a row gets a copy of the original row will be duplicated to the same table with the change of and the original row will get updated as needed keeping that in my rows are updated at an average of 10 assume that at least of the actions performed by the application happens only on the recent version of the database is an oracle 10g so to keep the table we can split the table to 2 the and the partitioning a good way of solving the history data keeping this solution limits other partition potential to these rows management in

in only works for the immediate you access a looks someone else beat me to the punch with the answer about it being possible to do in i think the way i did the code gen has some so post it thing i did differently is to use expression which enable you to use the compiler to do overload resolution and generic argument stuff is and you want to have to replicate it your self if you can help your the code would work like del would probably want to store the delegate in a readonly static so that you only have to compile it need to specify 3 generic owner type this is the class that you would have invoked the code from if you were not using base class this is the class you want to make the non virtual call delegate this should represent the signature of the method being called with an extra parameter for the possible to eliminate but it requires more work in the code gen method takes a single a lambda representing the it has to be a and only a if you want to extend the code gen you can support more complex the lambda body is restricted to only being able to access lambda and can only pass them in directly to the you can remove this restriction if you extend the code gen in the method body to support all expression that would take some work you can do anything you want with the delegate that comes so the restriction too big of a important to note that this code is not it could use a lot more and it work with or parameters because of expression tree did test it in sample cases with void methods returning and generic and it you can find some edge cases that any the il gen static tdelegate where tdelegate if throw new must be a delegate var body as if body throw new a call foreach arg in if support non lambda parameter you need to add support for compiling all expression throw new a constant or parameter if null support a non constant you have to implement support for compiling all expression throw new a constant base var parammap new int index foreach item in parametertypes var m new var builder var calltarget if var paramindex foreach item in var param if var obj return obj as

in templates and generics are compared to java generics which are but they have also large like in there is runtime support by using getting an object describing the types used to instantiate a have and all it does with types is done at compile biggest difference between generics and templates indeed are that generics are better type they are always in the sense that they allow operations that are not stated valid at the time of defining the chief designer raised as a reason of that the added complexity it would have taken to have implied not well versed with so i talk further talk about about how matters are in and how they are going to be so that people think stuff is all templates are not if you do an at template definition time it is implied that the operation will succeed at instantiation not even required to a compiler that the template is syntactically checked for if it contains a syntax then that error has to be diagnosed at any diagnose before that is a pure goody of the implied constraint have shown to be easy for the template designer in the short because they have to care about stating the valid operations in their template they put the burden on the user of their template so the user has to make sure he fulfills all those often it happens that the user tries seemingly valid operations but with the compiler giving the user hundreds of lines of error messages about some invalid syntax or not found because the compiler know constraint in particular was violated in the first it lists all parts of code paths ever involved around the faulty place and all not even important and the user will have to crawl through the horrible error message is a fundamental which can be solved by just stating at the interface for a template or generics what properties a type parameter has to as far as i know can constraint the parameter to implement an interface or inherit a it solves that on a committee has long seen there is need to fix these soon will have a way to state such explicit constraints note as in the following requires t return a compiler signals an error at that because the expression as written is not marked valid by the this first helps the designer of the template to write more because the code is already to some degree to what is possible the programmer can now state that requires t return a it will the by seeing appearing as the return automatically implied that is because that use of appears in the rather than in the templates the other requirements were stated using requirement the user will get a appropriate error message if he uses a type that have an decouples the requirements from the the above works for primitive types aswell as for in this they are more but quite a bit the rules that state when and when requirements are satisfied are you can with the new rules say the requires call with an that would work by just writing a concept map for that teaches the compiler how an int can be it will get quite handy in loops like the programmer can tell the compiler how an int can satisfy the concept of an you could actually write such code in if you only write the appropriate concept which really all that enough with i hope i could show you that having templates constrained is not all that but in fact because the relationship betweens types and the operations on them within the templates are now known by the and i even written about which are another nice thing in remember that is future not yet but it will approximately at then we will have to wait for some compiler to implement that all from concepts were accepted into the draft but have been voted out at late of too but perhaps we will see it again in the next all

in there is a need for some code to be run before is if only to transform the command line into the c calling in the standard library needs some and the exact needs can vary from compile to true program entry point is set at link and is usually in a module named something like for historical as the source to that module is available in the crt support initializations that are discovered at link a special segment is its structure is a list of function pointers of fixed which will be iterated early in and each function this same array one very much like of function pointers is used in a link to hold pointers to constructors of global array is filled in by the linker by allowing every module linked to include data in which are all concatenated together to form the segment in the finished only significance to the variable is that it is declared the to be located in that and is initialized to the address of a function to be called during the c the details of this are extremely for general you are probably better served by wrapping your initialization and your current main inside a new char other return special modifying the module itself or doing tricks to get additional early initialization functions called can be the best for when building embedded systems that run from rom without an operating system it is common to need to customize the behavior of the module in order to have a stack at all on which to push the parameters to in that there may be no better solution than to modify to initialize the memory hardware to suit your

interface definition language is used to set up communications between clients and servers in remote procedure calls there have been many variations of this such and sun onc dce rpc and so you use idl to specify the interface between client and server so that the rpc mechanism can create the code stubs required to call functions across the needs to create stub functions for the client and a using the idl very similar to a function prototype in c but the end result is slightly such client main server function this instead of calling in the same calls a client stub function the same prototype as which is responsible for packaging up the information and getting it across the wire to another this can be the same machine or a different it really matter one of the advantages of rpc is to be able to move servers around at the a process that will receive that information and pass it to the the stub receives the unpacks it and passes it to the real real function then does what it needs to and returns to the server stub which can package up the return information return code and any or and pass it back to the client client stub then unpacks that and passes it back to actual details may differ a little but that explanation should be good enough for a conceptual actual idl may look void int int that stuff at the top is basically networking the meat of it is inside the interface section where the prototypes are this allows the idl compiler to build the x stub and x server functions for compiling and linking with your client and server code to get rpc does use idl think they have a midl for com also used third party products with ms operating both dce and onc

interfaces lend themselves to readability as long as the method names are chosen that in like to nominate this particular api as a member of and takes an and returns true if the object is an instance of the you naturally tend to read it from left to right like actually the other but not all methods could possibly be named positioned in the to anticipate how they might appear in so this really a just pointing out another aspect of fluent interfaces the choosing of method names in order to cause the least many of the examples given the only reason a fluent interface is being used is so that several properties of a newly allocated object can be initialized within a single has a language feature that very often makes this unnecessary object initializer myobj new someproperty another complain str perhaps would explain why expert users are less familiar with the term for chaining calls on the same object it needed quite so often in properties can have this is an opportunity to call several methods on the newly constructed without having to make each method return the same limitations property setter can only accept one property setter cannot be would like it if we could call methods and enlist in as well as assign to inside an object initializer myobj new someproperty another complain str click why should such a block of modifications only be applicable immediately after we could someproperty another complain str click would be a new keyword that operates on an object of some type and produces the same object and type note that this would be an not a so it would exactly capture the idea of chaining in a you could use syntax regardless of whether got the object from a expression or from an ioc or factory fact you could use after a complete and it would be equivalent to the current style of object myobj new someproperty another complain str click as charlie points out in the static t t if return above wrapper simply forces a action to return and hey presto anything can be in that of but with event myobj new on a factory method instead of a myobj resist giving it the check for null as so if you have something that might return you can still apply to it and then check it for	
internal separate from my has stated that they prefer to do incoming authentication based on client which sounds good to except that i messed with them before and quite sure where to start researching went straight into a lot of detail that not sure is pertinent to what i need to find if i have an iis6 server with a web app that runs under an ad user what steps should i take to eventually fire off a request from that web app to a remote via guessing i do see that we have an internal trusted certificate authority and remote server is running apache on linux essentially in learning not necessarily looking for a list of what needs to happen if i could learn how it works while learning how to do be nice too you have any resources i could start looking into in order to figure out how to successfully authenticate securely via ssl with this remote server and communicate with it via client probably from creation of the client cert on though like to more fully understand how it all works in the first and client

is a classic example of trying to use a sledge hammer when a hammer is you want to extract some crazy reporting data out of a table but to do so is going to kill your sql what you need to do to track changes is to create a tracking table specifically for this then use a trigger that records a change in value in a product into this so on my products when i change the price it goes into the price tracking you are using this to track stock prices or something similar then again you use the same approach except you do a comparison of the price table and if a change occurs you save so the comparison only happens with new all the old comparisons are still housed in one location so you need to rerun the querry which is going to kill your sql servers

is a quite common situation in our applications that some entity have to be represented by an for example and things like there are conditions or flows in the code that use the values to decide between one action or so the values have to be in some way for the application it has to be able to refer to a specific instance to decide instead of referencing the class in a that is why we use enums instead of just a regular problem is that these entities also need to be stored at least in the as fields of other we usually create a table for each to be capable of having referencial integrity checks in these and also that the data have a in the database alone without the need to refer to the enum to find out what each id the data for these entities should be populated from the data in the but nowadays we have the values duplicated in the db initialization becomes a bit more complicated when an orm like hibernate is like to know how other people handles this kind of not fully comfortable with the idea of having a duplication between an enum and a database but i found a better solution to handle duplication between java enum and database

is a you can iterate this collection casting each member to check and get the name of the control from use to get a reference to the control returns a control perform whatever type checking and casting you need to and then if you can cast the control to textbox or some other control that contains the backcolor cast it and set the a simplified private void control textbox foreach v in if c check the make sure you can cast t or however else you want to handle reason i include code for the type checking stuff is because you may want to handle the different control types if not using the tooltip fields on your you can use this field to store additional info of like the tag that might be considered ugly but there for you if you need be used as a hint of what to do with

is an acronym for resource acquisition is technique is very much unique to because of their support for both constructors destructors almost automatically the constructors that are matching that arguments being passed in or the worst case the default constructor is called destructors if explicity provided is called otherwise the default one that is added by the compiler is called if you write an destructor explicitly for a this happens only for objects that are meaning that are not using the free store using technique makes use of this object feature to handle the objects that are created on the by explcitly asking for more memory using which should be explicitly destroyed by calling the class will wrap this another object that is created on the hence when constructor is the wrapped object is created on the memory when the handle goes out of destructor of that object is called automatically in which the wrapped object is destroyed using with oop if you wrap such objects inside another class in private you have access to the wrapped classes members methods this is the reason why smart pointers handle are designed these smart pointers expose the wrapped object as typed object to external world there by allowing to invoke any that the exposed memory object is made up note that smart pointers have various flavors based on different you should refer to modern programming by andrei alexandrescu or boost to learn more about hope this helps you to understand

is an interesting question about scaling in a serious are essentially do i establish n connections to an internet where n is only way to do this effectively and efficiently is to you cannot do this on a single so you will need to be able to fragment and partition your client base into a number of different so that each is only handling a idea would be for a single server to hold open as few connections as possible out the connectivity while holding enough connections to make whatever service hosting viable by keeping communication to a minimum this will mean that any two connections that are related as two accounts that talk to each other a will have to be on the same will need servers and network infrastructure that can handle you will need a subnet of ip each server will have to have stateless communication with the internet your router will not be doing any nat in order to not have to track will have to talk to there is no way that aol will be able to handle this level of connectivity without considering cutting your connection any service of this scale would have to be negotiated with aol so both you and they would be able to handle the are multiplexing technologies that you should kqueue and epoll come to order to write this massively concurrent and teleco grade i would recommend investigating erlang is designed for situations such as these telecommunications grade it is currently used for running ericsson telephone

is another way of saying your algorithm is linear in the number of digits in the size of the perhaps you have a new algorithm to factor a large that you can show to be linear in the number of a 20 digit number thereby takes twice as long to factor as a 10 digit number using your this would have log it would be worth something for the has the same it takes roughly 10 bisection steps to cut the interval length by a factor of 1024 but only 20 steps will cut the interval by a factor of complexity does not always mean an algorithm is fast on all the linear factor in front of the may be so your algorithm may be terrible on small not becoming useful until the problem size is appreciably large that other algorithms die an exponential

is fairly just had a quick read on design from what i can by effectively branching the files individually into an arbitrary going to be heading for a world of pain when you start to merge things back to their original location the merge probably be done in a single commit across all the i think you can do a similar thing to design parts in subversion with a bit of a design part can be simulated using externals allows externals to point to files as well as do you could setup your project heirarchy like parts folder would only contain an property which brings in the appropriate files for that part into the appropriate then checkout the rather than and you get a working copy that contains just the files you want in the structure that the part and when you going straight into trunk no merging required can also baseline your parts by first branching the entirety of trunk and and then changing your part externals to point to the branch instead of the main this increase the size of the and your working copy keeps exactly the same just sourcing all your files from the branch rather than any updates to that part also goes against the branch merging the changes of the part is just a bog standard merge of the branch back into which is standard svn the definition of parts gets more since in the scheme each part is defined manually and not need some form of script that knows the parts hierarchy and given a part can build the appropriate externals definitions which can then be applied to a parts while subversion explicitly provide the abstraction layer of it can be modeled manually fairly accurately only limited by the capabilities of and the scripts which you use to manage

is how i do using for form in endfor a javascript var newelement var total type var name total var id var newfor total type it accepts as the first and the of formset as the 2nd what the should do is pass it what it should in this i pass it so that jquery looks for the last table with a class of the part of it is important because the is also used to determine what the new form will be inserted more than likely want it at the end of the rest of the the argument is so that we can update the notably as well as the actual form if you have a formset full the management fields will have ids of and while the form fields will be in a format of with being the form starting with so with the argument the function looks at how many forms there currently and goes through every input and label inside the new form replacing all the field from something like to and so after it is it updates the field to reflect the new form and adds it to the end of the function is particularly helpful to me because the way it is setup it allows me to use it throughout the app when i want to provide more forms in a and make me need to have a hidden form to duplicate as long as i pass it the formset name and the format in which the forms are laid hope it

is important to remember that haskell is a functional this means that functions are not allowed to have any side effects at including printing debug messages to your is however possible to break this purity and it can be useful in take a look at the module there you will find a function string a you can use it in your code like integer integer bool x y x y integer integer counter num let quotient div num then trace show else num then findfactors findfactors the comments is also a an expression is not evaluated before the result is actually using the trace function can be a bit confusing in a lazy setting because it is not always easy to understand when the trace message is printed to screen it is printed at haskell is a very different kind of language it is perhaps best to try and develop programs in a equally different try to reason about your functions instead of using and similar learn to take advantage of haskells powerful type system and use to test your function once it passed the type

is not a solution is more efficient in terms of where the array may be sparse you can use null pointer to represent a matrix line of all this would be each would be allocated 2d array is not necessarily an array of will generally be faster in terms of since it works out memory locations with without having to memory talking of the 1d array of the unlikely to be any faster than the equivalent 2d version since you still have to do the calculations at some point to find the correct cell in your code rather than letting the compiler do edit where java was added as a believe java 2d arrays are of the array of arrays variety will require two memory accesses as opposed to the one required for a 1d so the 1d array with manual index calculation may well be instead of declaring and may get more speed just need to be careful that you get the formula mixed up anywhere swap 4 and 7 speed difference is based on how i think java is coded under the covers so i could be wrong i doubt it my advice as always for optimisation

is nothing about its a vital part of the web and most sites use it in some you really have two main either store the object in the database between pages means saving an incomplete or put it in both have advantages and session you have to save a partial object to the but if the user leaves or the session times out you lose all that it can also lead to a larger memory footprint per user and when you get to scaling it causes some other of which can be solved using on a load balancer or central session database way is better in lots of ways but usually you want to save incomplete object to the one compromise is to create another table and to save the object serialized to that its not going through your real tables and so you have to compromise on your database can also store session data in the database which is basically doing the same the end its a judgment call between the two i have used both over the

is one of those poorly documented aspects of dynamic compilation that cropped up when web sites were first actual answer for your specific question though will require that you tell us more about what exactly you are trying to do with the class from most of the time you just have to worry about the namespace or assembly name to use those classes in your you just use the class name and the compiler will figure it out and hook everything up for biggest exceptions run into with this are when using web controls that put into for those you need a directive in the aspx and for that you need an assembly name and a files in are compiled into an assembly named that this has two not what you can use when you need the assembly name for register directives or in or what as far as i you will not be unable to use a class in register directives or some settings that require a namespace unless you have explicitly wrapped that class in a namespace

is quite easy to know the web method is called asmx of the file 4guysfromrolla about they have a technology makes you expose methods as a web service so you can connect it the from everywhere and use it the data between server and you can send big files in a clear you can protect the access to the web service using but it is a pain and quite normally in asmx we use username passsword to give access to a method in plain you are in the different world about web and this is the best technology in to expose services you see the not wcf does not need iis to it can run as a system service on the using a console ambient command in so we say that wcf is a not a web remember asmx need iis to run and will only run hosted in a web wcf you can use ssl to encrypt the communication do that in asmx you need to use web services and it is quite easy to implement you can send big files and securely do that in asmx you need to use message transmission optimization can set the transmission preferences just changing one line of or if you change the xml configuration the security is much etc you get a better general overview with but there is much to expose web services that you do not need to you can use no problem at but if you need to protect the communication do it in can read here some performance comparative between the 2

is similar to a method using reflection on a singleton but it has a much deeper first i want to say this is for a project i was just playing around with ideas this is in no way production and the project has taken a very different but this problem still haunts me so here it have a singleton that only contains object instances although are essentially singletons as but referenced by the base static kernel new devices new interfaces new interoperability new environment new data new this would be all fine and dandy but these are themselves often container for i might want to do the an error username i am doing this from a user command which is another discussion for a later so question the primary question here how do you write a recursive reflection function to break apart a class path string like this to execute a a that the call has already been broken down into a structure containing an ordered string array for the path a string for the and an object array for the methods on a singleton object via reflection in an object

java many classes are prefixed with eg abstractlist the end why does it matter that one needs to know whether a class is abstract just from reading only so much detail one can cram into a class name before they become quite personally find the prefix thing for interfaces quite ugly as i believe one should not try and encode such details in a class i believe by combining implementation details with the interface name one comes up with truely meaningful yet short a perfect example is hashmap etc all very discriptive and

joel is way off in his and his conclusions and recommendations are not based on any fundamentally he says that you should be able to schedule your work down to units of time of hours or less before you even but the reality is you know what those units of work are all going to be before you get in to the so you come up with an breakdown of what going to do before you even pop the hood and have that breakdown reflect what actually happens with any a project estimate is very difficult if you want that estimate to be of any coming up with accurate estimates is difficult for programmers because very often you discover all the complexities of the project until you get under the the solution to this is to get under the hood when coming up with for smaller projects bug fixes this is fairly the bug on your the code that is causing the out how to write the code that will fix the how long it will take you to write that finding the code you have to write you necessarily must discover most or all the complexities that would have thrown off your interesting thing about this method is that the time it takes to generate the estimate is very often of the total time to actually do the you practically have to do the work in order to come up with an with bug fixes the solution is often on the order of one line of so your estimate will end up being 5 fine because deadlines can be set around estimates like you get practice with this you will get better and better at how long things will at first only be able to how long the smallest projects will but over time you will be able to estimate larger larger

joel spolsky give a programmer a rest and they can start playing with the service right figuring it if the service had a well machine readable then the programmer have to waste any time figuring it that is necessarily an example of good implementation of a well specified but that was the point of soap was a simple protocol which allowed you to add a header to a and had a standardized mapping of object instances to xml putting the handling metadata in the message simplified the client and meant you could very simply persist and queue never needed the header processing details when i built soap services back in this was and it was then normal to use get for getting information and queries different to most applications which claim to be rest has more in terms of using hyperlinks for service and post with a soap payload to perform those actions which created resources would return the url of the created resource to the and the client could then get the i think the fact that wsdl made it easy to think only in terms of rpc rather than actions which create resources which made soap lose the

just thought add my two cents to the i am currently developing daily in i was hired here new england about years ago as a web with little programming experience a former i was a web i knew css and html like the back of my but only some very limited in i even heard of the lasso programming language before i started they were pretty confident that pick it up as skeptical as i they were the lasso syntax is quick and easy to once you wrap your head around the syntax and the the rest falls into place in a short time i was able to build some really database web far as clearly is nowhere near the size of that of php or but what found is that developers are die hard fans of the language and thus are very active and i find a small devoted community more easily approachable and less most of the really juicy lasso conversations take place on oh i went to the lasso developers conference last year and was blown away by the dedication of the lassosoft company and the developer to mention all of the exciting stuff coming up in lasso later this downsides to first and no two ways about it if just looking to build something for demo or for a very small you might be able to get away with the lack of mature hosting take a look at the vast amount of stuff you can get in any random php hosting plan and compare that to anything you can find for pretty rough out there guys are not much to look but are pretty guess that most lasso users are hosting their own solutions you decide to keep going with here a few resources that found to be a puplic exchange for lasso custom of the worth a lasso environment for eclipse as well as a support in coda i enthusiastically mean for this to be so be happy to answer some specifics for good luck with whatever direction you choose to go

justification is you implement validation on the server side of things as otherwise abusing your code will be very easy by just disabling making it to submit any data without javascript will not solve personal experience i think most internet users hava js enabled the portion of users who may have problems with site is so unless you need to reach it probably should not be a big easiest way to determine js with just a single redirect would be to set a cookie with javascript code and then use the aforementioned to after that the server should be able to read the cookie set by assuming while quite difficult to share validation rules and other logic automatically on both server and the client using tech like i would suggest checking out aptana jaxer is a javascript based framework amongst other will allow you to share the very same javascript code on both client and very nice if you want to validate on the but want to write your validation rules

key with migration is to do several do not do anything without a current if the keys will be you need to store both the old and new in the new structure at least temporarily if the key field is exposed to the users because they may be searching by it to get old you need to have a thorough understanding of the relationships to child if you change the key field all related tables must change as this is where having both old and new key stored comes in if you forget to change any of the data will no longer be correct and will be so this is a critical out some test cases of particularly complex data making sure to include one or more test cases for each related store the existing values in work start the migration you insert into the new table using a select from the old depending on the amount of you may want to loop through batches one record at a to improve if the new key is an you simply put the value of the old key in its field and let the database create the new do the same with the related then use the old key value in the table to update the foreign key fields with something fkfield table2 table1 t1 on your migration by running the test cases and comparing the data with what you stored from before the it is utterly critical to thoroughly test migration data or you be sure the data is consistent with the old migration is a very complex it pays to take your time and do it very methodically and

kinda agree with david on regex matches should not be used as an exclusive criterion to decide if the passed date in the usual procedure in javascript validation involves a few steps the first step is to ensure that the passed string matches date formats by matching it against a the following may be a stricter regex assuming that the only allowed separator is a forward expected the second step is to parse the string into a date object which returns the of milliseconds since use this number as a parameter for the date since js automatically rolls over the passed date to the nearest valid you still cannot be certain if the date object created matches that which was to determine if this the best way is to split the passed string according to the separator and compare individual date d is the created date object as explained arrdateparts return return

languages might permit but neither community condones the monkeypatching condoned in either but you hear about it more often in ruby because the form of open class it uses makes it very easy to monkeypatch a class and because of more acceptable in the ruby but still frowned monkeypatching simply as prevalent or as easy in which is why you hear the same arguments against it in that python does nothing that ruby do to prevent the reason you about it more often in ruby is that this in def puts def puts give you a class that contains two and whereas this in def print def print leave you with a class that only contains the method as redefinition of a class clobbers the previous definition to monkeypatch in you actually have to write def print print is harder than the ruby that alone makes ruby code much easier to monkeypatch than python

law of do second do it unless you actually have measured and know for a fact that you need to optimize and if objects are really expensive to and if they can actually be reused can reset the state with only public operations to something that can be it can be two gains you mention are not really memory allocation in java is cost was close to 10 cpu which is so reducing the creation of objects only saves you the time spent in the this can be a gain with really heavy objects that can be reused without you reuse the the same time is not in fact it can be with moving generational gcs or was up to the cost of a gc run is determined by the number of alive not by the released alive objects will be moved to another space in memory is what makes memory allocation so free memory is contiguous inside each gc a couple of times before being marked as and moved into the older generation memory languages and as were designed keeping in mind the common if you steer away from the common usage in many cases you may end up with harder to read code that is less

let me say there are no hard and fast rules this is my understanding of ddd and repository but a fairly subjective from a ddd perspective what you might want to do when adding an answer to an existing question is something like the following style new var question you are using an orm that handles change tracking and that is configured to cascade child objects back to the database that is all you would need to do thinking of nhibernate but other orms can work in a similar by adding the answer to the question you have told the orm that you want the answer to be persisted in the database when the unit of work you typically call not a very way of approaching things where answer is in the same aggregate as question and question is the aggregate getting the objects out of the typically you would ask the repository for a question object id and then navigate to the answer from there an answers collection on the question answer in or do something useful this seems like a strange way to save or retrieve the answer object then you might want to whether answer does actually belong in the same or whether it would be better to break it out of the question aggregate	
let you parameterize code over types in the same way that arguments let you parameterize it over that probably explain a whole so lets go through it a step at a you want a program to print like you write void like well and but you also like so now you void like like notice that your two functions are almost you want to reuse the but provide different for what you void like is what function arguments are they let you reuse the same code with different are like but instead of passing in different you pass in lets say got code that needs to bundle two strings into an void s string return new b and later you realize you also need to bundle ints into an void s i string return new b int return new b like we can see a bunch of redundancy what we need is a function that returns a pair of and a way to the type of what we want a pair this is what generics are void s i t return new b angle brackets let you pass in a type to a function in the same way parentheses let you pass in here is the name of a type argument just like was the value argument any place t appears in the function will be replaced with the actual type you pass in and int in the a bunch of stuff you can do with generics beyond but the basic generics let you pass types into functions in the same way arguments let you pass in

like i do spend a crazy amount of time in java and crafting custom data structures that are just free in and crafting specialized functions to process these custom data in stl is really generics in java are they help create custom data structures much however they still require a lot of thought and there is a more fundamental reason why dynamic languages are easier to work it is a deep idea which is called duck some comments above refer to duck but please take time to reflect on what duck typing it is a fundamentally different way to view the a view that is incompatible with languages like java and typing means that you waste not time in defining what a duck by not having to formally define your objects you save a lot of time and getting definitions right is have a look at this blog post of mine where i give definitions are less useful than you typing has proven extremely the principle in is what has made xml so significant and useful on the but just an instance of duck way to express duck typing is by the web mantra strict in what you generous in what you that is also a very fundamental you may want to back to a long blog post of mine where i explain duck typing and how it relates to things like ai and artificial intelligence and

lot of people seem to struggle with the concept of arrays at particularly arrays of a little too getting past that initial block just requires a concrete exploration of the an example used a lot that shows the basic mechanics in a say building a role playing game and you want to keep track of your you could use an array of integers like could be strength could be dexterity could be so add a level of maybe we want to introduce a potion of strength that increases strength by 5 for 10 we could represent the stat side of that by making this into a this is my current this is my normal this is the number of turns until the strength potion wears this is my current so you get the added a 2nd dimension to hold details about the 1st what if i wanted our stats array to handle statistics for more than one i could represent that by making this into a character current character current would be even better to create some constants or enums to eliminate magic numbers from the strength dexterity intelligence currentvalue 0 normalvalue potionturns i could 5 character set the normalvalue of dex to few more thoughts about at least in the world where i most of us have to use them in our lives too often because slowly being relegated to underpinnings for more elaborate data structures like if i were to implement character realistically i would not use still important to get your head around them because they are and there are definitely cases where

lots of people have made the point that you tile the sphere with hexagonal tiles maybe you are wondering euler stated there are lots of interesting and diffenernt proofs and even a whole that given a tile of the sphere in x polygons with y edges total and z vertices total examble a cube has 6 polygons with 12 egdes and 8 the formula y z always hold the a topological statement so a cube and a sphere or to be precise only their border is really the same you want to use only hexagons to tile a sphere you end up with x having edges but one edge is shared by two hexagons so we only want to count of and vertieces but again each of them is shared by 3 hexagons so you end up with using the you end up with the false statement so you really use only why the classical soccer ball looks like he does of course modern ones are more fancy but the basic fact

makes more sense to ask about a particular aspect of a bit like asking windows key parts of linq are for from a these are representations of code as for an expression tree could represent the notion of a string call the length property on and return the the fact that these exist as rather than as compiled code means that linq providers such as linq to sql can analyze them and convert them into these are expressions like x int x expressions are converted either into or these are expressions like are still statically just the compiler generates an immutable type for you with properties and these are usually used with which allows the type of a local variable to be inferred from its initialization these are expressions like person in are translated by the compiler into a form which use query overload resolution etc is applied which is absolutely key to being able to use the same query syntax with multiple data without the compiler having any knowledge of types such as the above expression would be translated these are static methods which can be used as if they were instance methods of the type of the first for an extension method like static int string return letter letter then be used like foo count that the implementation of uses another extension most of the relevant then there are the implementations of the standard query in linq providers such as linq to objects and linq to sql i have a presentation about how reasonably simple to implement linq to objects on the page of the in depth web way providers such as linq to sql work is generally via the at their they translate expression trees into other query and then construct appropriate objects with the results of executing those that cover everything you were interested if anything in particular you still want to know just edit your question and have a

martin gives you a good dissection and explanation of what went wrong with your specific but address the general question should you use the read answer to that is when you want to read successive lines from some file possibly the standard output of some previous sequence of commands in a possibly splitting the lines into several separate the splitting is done using the current value of which normally means on blanks and tabs count in this they separate if there are multiple variables in the read then the first word goes into the first the second into the and the residue of the line into the last if only one the whole line goes into that are many this is one of the simpler scripts i have that uses the split jleffler exp create basic set of with log mode with buffered with buffered read dbs if then else sqlcmd database resource to command with a has its output sent to a so the output goes into the read dbs the first word goes into and is the name of the database i want to the remainder of the line is placed into the body of the loop deals with unlogged databases and do not then run a program separate from the microsoft of the same been around since about to create a database and populate it with some standard tables and data a simulation of the oracle and a set of tables related to the of scripts that use the command are bigger but generally read lines containing one or more file names and some other attributes of and then apply an appropriate transform to the files using the file grep sed xargs wgrep version while read read x read x while read file type link owner group read x while read file type link owner group while read size while read read dist read dbs read msdfile read gfile sfile version read name type read name type is my command line i ran this in my is a variant of grep that only matches entire words avoid words like this gives some indication of how used x lines are for an interactive script that reads a response from standard but exits if the command gets eof if standard input comes from

me if i am wrong but tagged classes and are two different concepts though not necessarely mutally one has the urge of using tags in a class to define the type then one revise their class hiearchy as it is a clear sing of conceptual bleed where an abstract class needs to know the the implementation details that the class parenthood tries to are you using the correct pattern in other words are you trying to coerce behaviour in a pattern that does not naturally support it as is the ability to loosely define a type where a method can accept any types just so long as the necessary methods in the parameter instance are the method will then use the parameter and call the necessary methods without too much bother on the parenthood of the the smelly hint as charlie pointed the use of much like static or other smelly whenever they appear one must ask i doing the right thing here not that they are inhertitly wrong but they are oftenly used to hack through a bad or ill fitted oo	
me if this has been asked i did a search but find anything that specifically answered this but be happy to be taking a peek at both the entity framework and linq to and while i like the systems of course the linq a little skeptical on the taken query results and inspected and they appear to implement the standard interfaces and more importantly leading me to believe that binding them to a grid anything is going to use reflection to my entity this seems like a comparatively expensive especially when all of the code is generated anyway and could implement the anyone have any insight into is reflection used to the value of the if does this have a performance impact and does anyone have any idea why they went this actually concentrating on whether or not is implemented somewhere along the as what has the capability to provide an explicit mechanism for defining and interacting with properties without resorting to while i have a linq to sql project i did inspect a simple entity framework entity query and it did not appear to implement does anyone know if just looking at something or if not why this is the accepting i thought it might be helpful for others if i posted some simple code i used to seamlessly implement his i put the following in the static constructor for my static type in if new this is for linq to sure an equivalent version could be written for the entity this will scan the assembly for any types with the attribute and add a custom provider for each of entity to sql data binding use

mention your if not sql the specifics of how to get the data might be but the advice is fundamentally the at for but the first thing to do is to follow advice and scan for execution plans using management studio if you are running sql guessing see is that for small date the optimizer picks a reasonable query but that when the date range is it picks something completely likely involving either table scans or index and possibly joins that lead to very large temporary the execution plan analyzer will reveal all of scan means that the optimizer thinks that grinding over the whole table or the whole index is cheaper for what you are trying to do than seeking specific you eventually want to do is get indexes and the syntax of your query set up such that you keep index seeks in the query plan for your query regardless of the date failing that the scans you require are filtered as well as you can manage to minimize temporary recordset size and thereby avoid excessive reads and

most bugs you find them after the and you fix them by trying to the simple bug simple key to your issue is being able to recreate the with a complex environment like thinking the only way you can do this is to take every interface point that could and implement logging for that ie dump to file of course you want this turned on all the but you have to code it in at the then setup a test environment that can then be driven from log in this way you can run and circumstances until you the and then of the way to solving	
most common solution is to have an activity you can assume that an active user will make at least one request within amount of time say 5 minutes or can enforce this by putting an async request triggered off a timer that starts when the page for if assuming that all active users will make at least 1 request every then each page will request an empty page every that as long as they have the browser window always have activity from that this is handled by asynchronous not by any sort of reload this makes it absolutely transparent to the an added see if you can make that ajax request pull down some useful rather than just enforcing licensing

most effective data structure for a cache is an caches work if your data structure is laid out sequentially as cpus read entire cache lines 32 bytes or at once from main algorithm which accesses memory in random order trashes the caches because it always needs new cache lines to accomodate the randomly accessed on the other hand an which runs sequentially through an array is best gives the cpu a chance to speculatively put more memory into the which will be accessed this gives a huge performance a tight loop over a large array also allows the cpu to cache the code executing in the loop and in most cases allows you to execute an algorithm entirely from cache memory without having to block for external memory	
most important part of your html is that it makes semantic if you want to display an inline element as a block level element perfectly provided the html behind it makes this is an important part of being able to separate content from if you can describe something as a list then it be an html either a or not a strict but a good if you want to follow that guideline then ok to use as long as you put block level elements inside inline the markup as simple as possible i would say it should look as more about product some additional information on styling lists misused or has a list of different styles that might be

my comments on your is a bad name for what essentially is a layer assigned to abstract i would probably call it or or dao access instead of which is ambiguous and could absolutely mean you really want to decouple your business layer from your your logic layer should only accept interfaces to the and not concrete dal are two schools of thought as to where validation should some are completely fine with validation sitting at the ui others would rather throw exceptions or pass messages from the business whichever way you just be duplicate validations in multiple and be ahead and try coding would probably be the best piece of advice i could give well and fine thinking it but at one point need to see it while coding it and only then will subtle quirks and pitfalls reveal whatever prototypes you can come up with will definitely be valuable to the direction your development and design takes your within the same namespace or calls to concrete classes are definitely i think it will be overly convoluted for you to need to put up interfaces for business logic i mean is there more than one set of rules you should a believer of keeping things simple and following make an interface until there are more than two classes that are going to implementing that interface dal is always an exception to this

my current mvc app found that enough to test the interaction between the repositories and the more than this is to iron out any wrinkles in the nhibernate everything exaggerating when i say above that layer is unit tested in i did have some integration tests from the controllers all the way down the stack to the database and these used an ioc container to build the controllers and the but i found these tests were really not adding anything and they were quite an overhead to so removed them from the tests for now i may find a reason to put them in but so far i the test process i use works like build process for the data access layer test assembly creates the test database via a fluentnhibernate configuration the build process then runs some nhibernate repository level code to populate reference tables in the integration test that runs is then wrapped in a statement and the transactionscope never has so each test can run in isolation and the results can be setup and verified within the scope by an isession without altering the state of any other test using var session this is an nhibernate isession setup any dependencies for the repository tests var testrepository new repository test code goes here the repository is using a different validate the results here directly with the at this point the transaction is rolled back and we changed the test means that i have to modify the unitofwork implementation using the transaction is rolled back at a higher

my experience going 2000 items per container indexed is not the end of the what is is if you start to use multiple lists that are linked to each other through then it becomes a big pain when you want to filter a child based on a value in its parent that is not part of the reporting on this data can be very slow if you have a lot of records involved in the inclination in the past has been to use 3rd normal but that work to well with sharepoint lists so i would consider a fairly flat if you have relationships mostly want to use separate	
my experience static variables should only be used for singleton everything else can be either more cleanly contained by a singleton as a or made final as a logger however i believe in hard and fast so i would take my advice with a grain of that said i would suggest carefully examining any case where you consider declaring a static variable aside from a singleton instance and see if it can be refactored or implemented differently moved into a singleton container or use a final reference to a mutable

my opinion better to create a file for every where the file is named after the i use a slightly different notation than chad namely a class autoloading is a nice but i use it very often under certain like where classes of the same type are added or removed object start creating classes for identify the actors in your a method of doing this is to write down what your application is supposed to then scan it for nouns and modelling your classes after because a class represents a single class namens are singular most of the if there are multiple you should name it objectcollection or something like this try want to create a little book library app to keep track of my book it should track the books i the the and the friends i lent them for every friend the phone number should be so i can call all the information is stored in a represents a book represents a collection of already covered by property of a you build the which objects contain other how does the relation between them look contains 1 or more books book belongs to exactly one book is written by 1 or more can lend a book to 0 or 1 friend and only to one friend at a friend has a phone will also tell you a thing or two about how your database should look everything is do you really need a phone number only a in this you should make it a additionally phone numbers are not really shared between friend objects would make sense if several friends living together having the same number and it often but for now that would be a bit if the noun can be represent by a scalar value and there are no other values connected to it may be overkill to make over time you extend your you decided to store not only the phone but also the address and phone number are quite similar types of so you add other variables for post code and so at a certain point get frustrated because the friend class grew with lots of and some of whom are prefixed to group them together and so so you might decide to relocate those to an own called address you leave the phone number to or just to keep the code clean wrong with but be about class hierarchy and object confuse they are entirely different a class hierarchy arises if similar classes share some properties but are different in so you create one class with the properties and methods they share and child classes which inherit the properties and methods of the parent and also add their own to handle the our library what could that to be i think of anything besides one thing thats a bit but go for it and authors are both both have phone numbers and an but they also because authors write books and friends authors normally borrow your so you might define the name and in the person but clearly belongs to friend while belongs to really make sense because never going to process authors and friends in the same but lets say you needed a list of all the adresses stored in your you could loop over your collection of persons and call to be even php is a bad example for because you can store whatever types you want together in an array and access them in every way you but in stronly typed languages not in java you have to define a datatype for an and possible to store different types if they have a common inheritance restricted to the methods the original class enough of that class inheritance object hierarchy simply states which objects should contain other a library contains book a book contains an author additional to be use names like name it because book objects is what you a good idea to name methods after the data type going to common if they return good naming conventions may be or as in or that are always the same for all objects of a certain class may be class lets if a person can be male or female and storing that as or in the it makes sense define the class constants and so you have and scattered in your all over the that only generate a single instance could be modelled as a good example for this may be the database class highly unlikley you ever need to open more than one transaction at read more about singletons at wikipedia but it may be a bit early for some people think singletons are a bad because more or less in once you implement them this so if you model your database class as a but later decide you need more than one database connection but you have a if you take the singletons may be

my opinion the code repository should only contain source code as well as third party libraries required to compile this source code the third party libraries might be retrieved with some dependency management tool during the build the resulting binaries should not get checked in along with the source think the problem in your case is that you have proper build scripts in why building a binary from the sources involves some work like starting up importing the adjusting there are build scripts in getting the binaries can be done with a command ant think the most important reason not to checkin the binaries along with the source is the resulting size of your this will repository and maybe too few space on versioning system of traffic between versioning system server and the update times you do an svn update from the reason might code is easily so lots of the features of a versioning system do make but you easily compare your approach as described above introduces a lot of overhead in my what if a developer forgets to update a corresponding jar

need to track anonymous users with enabled they will go through the interact with and i would like to give them the best possible experience without requiring actual later if they they can register and their site activity will be tied to their new like stackoverflow but with the difference that i expect that majority of my users actually register but occasionally just i want to create a bunch of dummy records in the users and since i need it just for one i was thinking about something like trackingtoken 100 100 101 102 trackingtoken 100 would increment a lasttrackingtoken integer field and simply add that value to the users cookie and track his voting activity with if he decides to i would simply add his cookie trackingtoken value to his users i was thinking about a but since the voting table will be very large and i will need to query worried about indexing the uniqueidentifier the questions are for 3 but they are so related and i think the context is so i want to duplicate the question and context integer field better when it comes to performance and have in mind that trackingtoken is not a primary key you have some other idea how i could accomplish the scenario i i decide to go with the manual generation of integer what would be the best way to reliably a new assume a lot of concurrent users will hit the anonymous user

no technical reason why it be but we are really more talking about a set of constants within a common if an the numerical value is generally the fruit are only describing a set of named we are saying that a variable of type fruit can take one of these four what the integer value of each one is really not as long as i only refer to them by it matter if the value representing apple is or languages do allow you to specify the value that should represent but really sometimes but not part of the core purpose with they are simply there to give you a set of related named constants without having to specify an integer id for enums are often used to specify optional flags that can be combined with bitwise that is trivial to implement if each value is represented by an integer you just have to pick an integer that uses the bit pattern you values be useful in this operations make much sense on

not entirely sure what you are asking for but thought comment on a few things that seen arise in cots versus custom development choices over the is going to take time to properly analyse any cots systems for both from a requirements perspective and a technical how much custom dev could have been done instead of the the cots sales pitch the promises the moon on a plenty of flashy presentations from who will offer to meet any requirement to get the the most dangerous trap to fall into is being promised functionality that in the cots at present but they will add for you more often than not the salesman has said yes to you without even finding out if possible for their product to do for unit tests in the cots and also what development practices they good indicators of a cowboy development lack of tests and documentation are maintainability headaches in the wary if the cots vendor giving much info about technical aspects of their your desired system is fairly simple then your cots choice will also be fairly but if a complex system you would presumably offer it out for rfp for and to do that you are going to have to have a thorough and correct requirements will the time taken to produce requirements for the rfp out weigh a custom dev agile you are going to have to nail those requirements down super tight to make sure the cots system delivers and that will take a lot of time and i would never consider cots source code is available and i have had programmers assess seen and tried a working demo and not just glitzy sales time or personnel to do it i agree with if a core business function do it no matter	
not even just locking that is the you really want thread two to always print then you need a condition reason is that there is a race regardless of whether or not you create thread 1 before thread it is possible that thread code can execute before thread and so the map will not be initialized to ensure that no one reads from the map until it has been initialized you need to use a condition variable that thread 1 also should use a lock with the as others have because you want threads to access the map as though they are the only ones using and the map needs to be in a consistent is a conceptual example to help you think about you have a linked list that 2 threads are in thread you ask to remove the first element from the list the head of the in thread you try to read the second element of the that the delete method is implemented in the following make a temporary ptr to point at the second element in the make the head point at then make the head the temporary if the following sequence of events removes the heads next ptr to the second t2 tries to read the second but there is no second element because the next ptr was completes removing the head and sets the 2nd element as the read by t2 failed because t1 use a lock to make the delete from the linked list is a contrived and necessarily how you would even implement the delete it shows why locking is it is necessary so that operations performed on data are you do not want other threads using something that is in an inconsistent this

not putting anything called into session iterating over a dataset and storing each title prefixed by an as the property in a single news each write to overwrites the previous so only the last title gets stored at the end in any session is a troublesome place to be storing session is for data that persists over multiple page and can interfere if the user is loading two pages at a string without it on the way which is bad news for security on a if the title of the news might have a character in and not quite sure why taking the converting it to converting it to string converting it to string again then finally parsing it back to an general this seems like an uncomfortable mix of and codebehind it seems to me it should be possible to write this a whole lot simpler using something newstitle from news where never actually written a line of in my so this may not work edits from more users

not sure if this assists with your but one thing i learned rather recently and took to heart is to have your data unique identifier implementation not propagate directly outside of the data but to be wrapped in an for here is an interface which wraps a interface where t class a string representation of the domain the model originated string origin the model instance identifier for the model object that this refers this is a database file or some other unique expected data type of the keydatatype performs an equality check on the two model identifiers and returns if they are otherwise is all implementations must also override the equal identifier to compare if the identifiers are otherwise is bool business logic which may have in the past passed around as unique identifiers from a identity column in your database is now passed as public iperson retrieval logic data layer will then have a class which implements and populates its internal data type with the physical unique this insulates your business layer from any changes you may have at the data such as replacing your key identifiers with

note that i already know of and understand the this question is about the behavior of the memory model with regard to his discussion of the lifo inside out column from may 2007 msdn joe duffy incur an object allocation for each saving us from having to worry about aba then goes on to very briefly describe the aba problem and mentions that this can occur in native because the memory allocator can reuse an address as soon as well and but what makes programs immune to the aba is he implying that because nodes be reused immediately there is some delay between when a node goes out of scope and when the gc collects no possibility of the aba problem if is that a safe assertion to be the first to admit that i know all the intricacies of the memory allocator or garbage but my limited understanding leads me to believe that a reference and if a possibility that a reference can be then that make the aba problem if indeed highly the aba problem in

noticed a few regarding stress testing but more interested in knowing a good way to establish a bench mark of what my physical web server can working on a production system right now that seems to be slowing to a near halt on a daily and no one can seem to figure out what is causing the this is your standard set up web db i have created some simple pages that can do a few simple things that using to establish a benchmark for stress testing that i can later user when comparing with the production system that is already in have already built a sample aspx page that simply returns back some web server statistics about the box nothing maybe a few lines of also created a simple web service that will test a db connection given the correct again nothing heavy just opening a db connection and a sample query that really do i would like to know is a good stress level that the following tests should operate in using web application stress and curious what most people would expect the and the ranges should i already know at what point the web server starts its around 20 stress level and 10 stress multiplier give or which results in about page requests trying to find out if that number is way too and if some sort of indication that an issue between the client and the web server or a hardware issue of some or if more of an indication that nothing wrong and that the system is just too since i originally wrote this post the code has been moved to a server running windows 2003 utilizing iis like to know now is if i set up a relatively simple such as a basic file that just serves up a small what would you expect the page requests sec i could achieve from a stress is a good benchmark test for load testing a production system running

nov 2011 a of what i say below is still true however i have now got serious reservations about recommending realbasic for anyone trying to release to save me remembering to edit this post see if realsoftware have managed to release a robust version of their ide using the cocoa version of their if be very with a heavy heart that i write this because i still really like the language and think the framework and ide are the problem is apparently one of and possibly a software development culture inside the company that consistently fails to deal with a bug regression many bugs are fixed each release but there appears to be a huge tax on the developers in the number of introduced they have a very small team for the complexity of the especially considering the newly released web edition which is effectively an entirely new still theoretically a great product but take advantage of the trial test it thoroughly on each of the platforms you plan to target and decide if you can live with any bugs you find because they may be there for a language is a modern oo language that be hard for you to adapt to from your vaguely remembered pascal or current it has most of the power of without the dangerous bits that make debugging a you will also find the ide simpler and easier to deal with than say visual ide makes it very easy to throw together a gui and have it just work on multiple the pro version has one of the best debuggers used and it is easy to just work on a mac and develop for windows and compiling and testing with one is also a thriving community including many people at your level of expertise so you be mocked for being a am a professional software developer with over 25 years experience and currently mainly working in and a bit of for apps such as you realbasic is my tool of i believe someone downvoted this but have the guts to add a comment explaining heard about prejudice against realbasic but this is the first time encountered in what way was my answer inappropriate for this to add to my used by systems deployed to tens of thousands of end users i have the experience to applaud someone else doing a good job and the realbasic frameworks are very

now i find myself creating a constructor for accountservice an instance of this feel right at like this should not be a huge what you want to look out for are huge methods within your if you have methods that are 100s of lines long then it might be time to look at refactoring and breaking accountservice up into a few smaller to avoid instantiating services everywhere i need created a static class which has i call methods around the seems ok but i shake the that this is can use an of control to remove the need for these your objects are very large or are loading data during construction they typically should not be then constructing new instances of a class takes an infinitesimal amount of time and should not be something to worry

number of pages required is integer pagesize is the number of labels to print and is the number of labels per starting index is irrelevant for the number of pages as long as you know how many labels you are going to if you print 25 labels it matter if the starting index is 4 or still 25 you want to use the index to optionally leave labels blank on the first print 19 labels from index 14 to index 14 15 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 31 32 you first calculate how many labels to leave blank before the first is the modulus you add these empty items to the number of labels to calculate the actual number of items to for the example above it would be 3 19 this would then be used in the calculation above to get the number of

of good recommendations above that would work in most in my i ultimately wanted to load strings from a and keep the string resources as close to as i so i rolled my after looking at some of the implementations above for the resulting implementation was quite short and is a class which in my case derives from but it could derive from about any string there is also a class stringarg job is to take any parameter type and turn it into a string it mimics tostring in if a new object needs to be you just add another the constructor allows a format specifier for string class then accepts a string table id for the source a number of stringarg and finally an optional hinstance use lots of any of which could host the string so this allowed me to pass it or use a hinstance by to it it only takes a string id for an but it would be trivial to add an input string instead of a string s you are years old in for the stringarg class which does the equivalent of tostring on lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec cstring cstring hinstance dll implements this for getting own hinstance scenarios with a single resource dll need the string there are a bunch of member functions and constructors that take up to 10 these ultimately call centralformat which does the real string public hinstance hinst const hinstance hinst const const hinstance hinst const const const hinstance hinst const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const const const hinstance hinst hinstance hinst const hinstance hinst const const hinstance hinst const const const hinstance hinst const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const const const hinstance hinst void hinstance the implementation ok to post this much on although the bulk of it is very lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec return hinstance argscount below assumes a single character position cstring hinstance hold bool b string or more likely a bad stringid was used tell cstring could not be hinst ghcommonhinst was passed was not passed error inform for the degenerate lpcwstr pstr bool bskip this an incoming string only support 10 so the next char must be a closing bskip is a index positional cstring pstr past the two extra characters that we skipped ahead and peeked hinstance return const hinstance return const const hinstance return const const const hinstance return const const const const hinstance return const const const const const hinstance return const const const const const const hinstance return const const const const const const const hinstance return const const const const const const const const hinstance return const const const const const const const const const hinstance return

of most software developers i talk to have at least heard of d and have it mentally connected to basically those properties that you mentioned in your question fast the way should have been implemented in the first this for itself is a level of success that 99 percent of all programming languages created will never are some reasons though why not in the same league with language itself is a nicely done and sane but not different enough from other languages to really catch enough for a friendly really but not for i to use is no killer application that requires you to learn something that an average joe programmer wants to work with so badly that he goes through the hassle of picking up a new programming languages such as ruby and python have taken over some big chunks of the language making it harder for to find an corporate world is to a large extent java might get replaced as an application development language anytime soon but its successor will most probably run on the jvm because a pretty mature and stable piece of software with a large community and huge library most new such as are compatible with java one last but very subjective under the impression that the classical have fallen a little out of fashion in the part of the developer community that likes to check out new all that d looks really nice and seems to solve the problems it promises to solve in a solid and fast no reason why it find its

of these questions are things that you need to try different options to see what works that is the problem with there is no way to do almost you need to find out what works for your specific i will give my advice for your i prefer incremental i think it is important for the network weights to be updated after each this is a tough it really depends on the complexity of your how many input output and training patterns that there for your i might start with 100 and try ranges up and down from 100 to see if there is i usually calculate the total error of the network when applied to the test set the training after each if that error increases for about 5 i will stop training and then use the network that was created before the increase it is important not to use the error of the training set when deciding to stop this is what will cause you could also try a probabilistic neural network if you are representing your output as 26 each representing a letter of the this network architecture is good for classification it may be a good idea just to try a few different architectures to see what works best for your

one is fairly hopefully i can make this clear enough for somebody to help me i have an object lets call it a the manager has a collection of people that he the people all implement but different types of people have different i want to display this manager in a and under the manager node i want to show all the projects he is managing which can be determined from the people he the plan is to use a converter to convert a person into a list of here is the person class implements and the list holding the people implements code works great when i set the treeview the managers are displayed with their list of when i add a new person to the list of the treeview is not when i i can see that the collectionchanged is firing with the add action and the added also the collectionchanged event is not null so i know the ui is watching but the converter does not execute when the item is is the add method for the list holding the iperson void i somehow breaking the other things can i check converter just looks at each item in the people list and figures out what projects they are working on and adds the project name to an output converter treeview wont

one test case for each scenario is in some cases it is more convenient from implementation effort point of to test more than one scenario in one test if you use a framework that stop on first but tries to execute as much as possible in a test that framework is appropriate for multiple scenarios per test prefer to spend as less time as possible on unit and still get as most coverage as possible in that the it matters less how you implement the unit but more the correctness of those

one thing is bugging me about the idea of a as mentioned is that you still have a valid variable containing an but the type is being this seems allowable since we can still work with the address data the type is somewhat superfluous less in this dereferencing it is because to try and a make sense we know what class to refer and thus the memory to jump the vtable pointers to then seem to make sense that on its own would be ok since only refer to the but none of its no class information is needed to do just the i understand absolutely no use for but important in defining when things break allowing this a reference dereferenced but not accessing ref also makes and thus would allow void not saying anyone should take it up with those in but from a point of seem luc touraille pointed out above this is my it could be but the issue is a semantic the reasonable explanation i could come to was that since an object variable is a for a sequence of the type is of important semantic the being thought of as a variable with an address treats the type as somewhat superfluous not key to defining anyone agree with

packing is so perhaps your failure to understand it is because you imagine it is more complicated than it is either vertical a pile of or horizontal a queue of each element in that layout can expand or it can not for a horizontal layout with two which the code would since the default for packing is to have both those buttons added to the box will expand and they will each occupy half the no matter what the size of the container i think of this as widget widget if you want one of the buttons to not you will pack it like widget the button will only occupy the space it needs to draw text borders shadows images and the other button will expand to fill the remaining buttons need to be so a more situation is a textarea which you would want to expand to fill the other parameter that can be passed to is the fill and normally this can be it is enough here to say that if then the parameter is entirely ignored it make sense in that other thing you mentioned is i would generally say that this is not a good i say because there are situations where you will need to use but for someone beginning out with packing a user i would strongly recommend not using in let the boxes and other containers handle your layout for the does not do exactly what you would expect it to it does not change the size of a but merely how much space it will it may use and may even stretch to fill larger it will rarely become smaller than the but again because it is just a there is no guarantee theat the request will be

personal preference is to focus on making it visible that the type is for instance i would call it immutablelayer or if for some reason immutable is not a good word to prefix the name with i will add an attribute to the class indicating immutable is added in both has ups and the up is it gives a central place to check for just take a quick peek and the type and in there is no need to learn new method names or the downside to the approach is that you tell in certain type infererence scenarios that the value is for this code works just as well for an immutablecollection and a normal col i do not like to change method names to accomidate the reason being that it is a problem you will have to solve naming things should be but incredibly difficult some think of all of the types ever wanted to make imagine having to find new names or conventions for every mutating method on those a task and you will spend a lot of time educating users on those new dream scenario though is to find a way to increase the visiblity of immutable because the real problem not knowing the type is currently there is no good way to do this for all but hopeful for the next version of the languages

php version is out of php has been in the area for awhile and while there are not massive there are enough changes that i would say to test anything older is an unfair is on the verge of becomming final and you should include that in your benchmarks as there are massive improvements to php as well as being the last version of if you really want to split hairs php 6 is also in and a heavy overhaul totally different languages can be interesting but forget you are comparing apples to and the biggest bottleneck in any app is waiting on so the biggest factor is your database comparing php vs python vs purely on speed is pointless as all 3 of them will execute in less than 1 second but yet you can easily wait seconds on your database depending on your hardware and what you are you are worried what is taking the absolute wrong approach to choosing a there are more important such as in how easily can i find skilled devs in that how much do those skilled devs how much roi does the language how feature rich is the

prefer to divide my js files based on their function for i could have a single js file for all ajax based one for all validations and a common js library for all functions that are common to the entire web having a single file that combines the entire js scripts into one would definitely slow down the application because each page would load the entire even though only a small portion might be css i prefer to have a single common stylesheet that would contain the general styles available to the entire i might also create individual css files for pages that have a very specific layout know of any tools that could handle this dependency but when you divide your files according to this becomes unnecessary in most

pretty much as while the employeeid in employee will be unique update will not add a new just modify the existing the audit table will have multiple rows with the same employeeid for the initial one for each subsequent of that the entities in employee are but the entities in audit are audit they shoulld have their own want this if ever something goes wrong and you need to actually update or delete an audit if an employee is then one value is then updated again to be the original you now have two identical records in which would have to be deleted or updated together you used a limit clause in your update or also points up the usefulness of adding a timestamp to the audit table but think you should use that and employeeid as a composite composite keys entirely possible a granularity is less than the time it would take your system to perform two updates updates of the same as a batch sybase datetime has a three millisecond an intel core 2 extreme can do nearly 200 instructions in that

process has its own memory it makes it more difficult to share but also makes the program safer need for explicit that being processes can share the same memory in thread is cheaper to create or but the main difference is that it shares memory with other threads in the same this is sometimes and in addition crashing the process would kill all advantage of using multiple processes over multiple threads is that it would be easier to scale your program to work with multiple machines that communicate via network you could potentially run 16 processes on 8 but would not have a benefit from more than 4 threads on a if the amount of information you need to communicate is multiprocessing may make more for the i would say that suggests if you follow mvc your gui should not also contain the model with you can then communicate to a work manager that can report what data is already

proposal would be to have sqlexpress installed on your you can then have all the data available on the create a publication on your main and have your local machine suscribe to this replication you need to the data changes done on your you can stick to a basic then just have to change your connection string from your network mssqlserver to your localhost sqlexpress server instance to have your app for any you have to make changes to the database model while being you will then have to unsubscribe from the main server before making the changes on the local when back to the make sure that the same changes are done on the main my advice is to write your changes in save them in a and launch the file against the main server once back to work too much on or make sure your client is being billed for

providing more insight on the suggestions already reference to on codeproject makes use of web service for inferring location from a cell tower id in addition to the gps hardware in the phone if it is assumed that google has wide coverage on cell tower ids making the method perceivably the downside of this method is that it clear what view is on some one making use of the possible dispositions could include against this functionality being used by other programs encouraging developers to use the functionality or apathy not retricting use of it but not supporting use of it the danger of the apathy disposition is that at some point in the far future google could change the interface to the service without if you intend to make a program for commercial reasons then you will really want to get clarity on skyhook wireless service is extremely apple uses skyhook wireless for their wifi location in the iphone and as of a couple of months ago skyhook expanded upon the service so that instead of only doing wifi based location on windows mobile phones it will now use and cell tower the downside of this service is if you plan on using it commercially you will need to consider using this sdk from a managed application was initially a pain because of limitations in the interop abilities of the compact i managed to make a wrapper and posted it to the skyhook wireless discussion based few months ago there was an msdn article on location based for more information see the article and example code at noise was an msdn magazine code example from a few years ago that demonstrated how to automatically adjust your volume based on the ambient noise for more details see

python is compiled to bytecode and then interpreted in a if the python compiler is able to write out the bytecode into a it will do the other no explicit compilation step in python as there is with java or from the point of view of the it looks like python is just interpreting the file python offers an interactive prompt where you can type python statements and have them executed so the workflow in python is much more similar to that of an interpreted language than that of a compiled to me a lot of other i that distinction of workflow is more important than whether an intermediate bytecode step or

question boils down to not use exception for that handling for regular program avoid all i could have googled i will provide an example you all can attack at and java too many have with plenty of types some of behaviour i like at for example 1 seen my vicious add some insult to this injury and even expand this behaviour say datetime know datetime is sealed in but for the sake of this using a pseudo language is exactly like except for the fact that datetime sealed overridden add method increments this date with a but loops the maximum value for datetime is timespan to incremented with the given if is the sum wil and continue from public datetime override return catch calculate how much the maxvalue is regular program timespan saldo ts return exception course an if could solve this just as but the fact remains that i just fail to see why you use exceptions that i can see that when performance is an issue that in certain cases exceptions should be think in many cases they are more clear than and break any contract the method is the use them for regular program everybody seems to have is not that well underbuild as the of that reaction can am i read other dealing with all kind of special but my point is if you are clear and hounour the contract of your nothing wrong with shoot not use exceptions as regular flow of

question for today thanks for your input on the previous already searched the forum on this and nothing quite answers this use some 3rd party libraries which pop work onto the threadpool and we want to shutdown while there are outstanding shutting down an the application will shutdown even if there is work outstanding in the because these threads are back ground than doing some form of reference counting enforcing every item queued into the pool to use this which we have control is there some way to stop the application shutting down while there is outstanding work to be looked at using the vs but these can be the same because we may have caught the threadpool as a thread was freed up but not allocated a queued help there any way to stop an application shutting down with work still in the system

question is poorly phrased at least the title because it implies this difference is endemic and holds true for all instances of the body of the question is better phrased because it presents a reasonably detailed explanation of the sort of thing your code is it state what versions of runtimes you are nor does it state the target architecture or machine the code will run these things make big have done some this is some as to why you see the results you as good at writing performant code as you are at is not a or even likely but it is a real possibility you should versions of the jvm have some serious optimizations to make uncontended locks extremely this may skew things in your favour especially the comparison with the c implementation threading primitives you are the java code seems to run well compared to the c code it is likely that you are not terribly dependent on the heap allocation strategy would tell you the code runs less well than the java one assuming the code is then several possible reasons are using virtual functions which the jvm will inline but the clr will latest jvm does which may make some code paths considerably more efficient those involving string manipulation whose lifetime is stack the very latest 32 bit clr will inline methods involving non primitive jvm jit compilers use hotspot style mechanisms which attempt to detect the of the code and spend more effort an understanding of what your code spends most of its time doing it is impossible to make specific i can quite easily write code which performs much better under the clr due to use of structs over objects or by targeting runtime specific features of the clr like non boxed this is hardly instructive as a general

rather a lot of good literature on implementing malloc and similar but i notice that you include here are you aware that you can write your own implementation of and in that might be useful as a way to do it any the characteristics you want are going to depend pretty heavily on your that on the pattern of usage over if you have only mallocs and new if you have only mallocs of or a few block also other you get some leverage by having the ability to chain memory but c that basic implementation of malloc simply allocates a header that contains the data an use and the malloced malloc then constructs a new header at the end of its allocates the and returns a when you it just resets the in use trick is that when you do a lot of mallooc and you can quickly get a lot of small blobs that in but are hard to so you need some kind of bumpo gc to merge blocks of could do a more complicated but remember that takes you want a free to take up a lot of a paper on solaris malloc implementations you might find another building an alternative again in but the basics are the and you should read the on garbage and follow it to some of the more formal you really should have a look at generational garbage the basic idea is that the longer something remains the more likely is it to this is an extension of the gc you you allocate new stuff in one part of your memory call it when you reach a high water mark on you look through the allocated blocks and copy the ones that are still in use to another section of call it then you can just clear the g0 space and start allocating eventually g1 gets to its high water mark and you fix that by clearing and clean up g1 moving stuff to and when you rename the old g1 as g0 and vice versa and trick is that in c the handles you hand out to memory are straight raw you really move things around without some heap big asks moving stuff around just be a and indeed it but consider this this is not and just for for entertainment no warranty express or basic environment for mymemoryhdl char this will be your memory mallocate some if we get past it succeded your implementation of you create the memory and return a pointer to the char nextunusued partitionsize hwm so g0 will be the bottom half and g1 the top half to start char g0 char g1 void rtn memory completely exhausted return otherwise add header at nextunused includes some pointers for and a field with values used or set to used nextunused headerlen this could be niftier rtn nextunused nextunused size of the things are free set the flag in the using an now you do all the stuff and you get to your high water each block in your memory pool block header is still marked used block into other partition clear the partition go back to the original handle you saved in what does it point you just set it to 0x00 with where the magic comes in c at the pointer you returned from your malloc is no longer under your control you move it around after the in with you can fix

read before posting am aware of the multiply and add solution but since these are arbitrary length the multiply and add operations are not free so like to avoid if at all challenge is i want to be able to as a character pointer to a number in base 2 through 16 and as a second what base the number is in and then convert that to representation in base the integer can be of arbitrary my solution now does what the function but i was curious purely out of academic interest if a lookup table solution is have found that this is simple for and i can simply use a lookup table for each digit to get a series of for my problem is that i want to do this look up table method for odd like base i know that i could write the algorithm like atoi does and do a bunch of multiplies and but for this specific problem trying to see if i can do it with a look up definitely not so obvious with base i was curious if anyone had any clever way to figure out how to generate a generic look up table for base x base i know that for base you just give it one digit at a so the solution would likely have to lookup a group of digits at a ideas are greatly string to integer

read the and you quoted the part of it you so have to people dislike properties because they can make your code do surprising i type people reading it will normally expect that this is simply accessing a member field of the foo a almost and i can call it over and and get the same result every with it might actually be a function it might be an infinite it might open a database it might return different values every time i access is a similar argument to why linus hates your code can act surprising to the he hates operator necessarily mean simple it may mean some hugely complicated just like it may have side it may do i think this is a weak both languages are full of things like we avoid operator overloading in as after the same argument can be used allow we can that something is a regular and use it as if it was and not have to worry about what goes on behind the usually considered a good but it obviously relies on the programmer writing meaningful your properties behave like they have side they perform expensive or unsafe we want to be able to of as i have another reason to find them less than they can not be passed by reference to other can be passed as allowing a called function to access it functions can be passed as allowing a called function to access it that mean properties are evil or be for many

realize there have already been a number of posts on design and this could possibly be me over thinking things and going round in but i have myself all confused now and would like to get some clarity from the community am trying to separate a project i design architecturally very well to start out into different layers in their own should only call the logic layer to get its should not call or have references to anything just be a way of storing the layer should hold all of the methods to delete objects in the system and would have references to both the bo and the it would apply the business logic to the operations then delegate the actual crud to the would just do the crud operations on the it would have a reference to the as it would return them for the gets question is should the logic classes only call their equivalent dal class and just call logic classes in other class should only call so if it wanted to get a client object by id it would call rather than the reason i thought it maybe should stay on the its own layer was would seem to loosen the coupling between about the if getting a client object had some logic validation in it not the best but hope it gets the point am not sure if it is bad design by me but at the moment the business layer has a number of classes including clientbull and both classes have a call to one i use an interface for each class and have a factory to build the objects to try and reduce any coupling but they can not exist without each other now due to calling methods in both is this a bad architecture design seperation of

really depends on the context in which you ask that any experienced java or developer knows that technically almost impossible to have a general and therefore would not expect in a complex so most developers probably also expect a dependable deep the d programming on the other have a of transitive so a d programmer would probably expect it wherever it makes sense is quite	
really depends on the ha system if your system uses a shared ip and the traffic is managed by some hardware then it can be hard to determine if a certain box is a master or that will depend on a specific solution as long as you can add a custom script to the you should be ok for example the controller can ping a daemon on the master server every in the alerting simply check if the time of the last ping 2 your system have a supervisor controller but each node tries to determine the state you can have more if a split brain you can end up with both slaves or both so your alerting software will be wrong in both gadgets that can ensure only one live node and could the other in the second if the ha software works on both hosts you should be able to obtain the information straight from it has to know its own state at any because one of its main in most ha solutions you should be able to either get the current or add some code to run when the state heartbeat offers worry about the edge cases like a split brain almost any situation when you lose connection between the clustered nodes will be more important than the stuff that happens on the separate nodes the thing you care about is really logging alerting then ideally you could have a separate logger box which gets all the information about the current network cluster external box will probably have better idea how to deal with the if your cluster gets disconnected from the network loses you get any a redundant pair of independent monitors can save you from not sure why you mentioned dns due to its refresh time it be a source of any cluster

really depends on who the design document is targeted if for a boss who is then you are good with what you for then you are using the tool to help so you i create method level design docs when i am creating a but at a high level so i can figure out what the features of the various classes should found that across the primary functionalities of a class have little to do with the programming language we are working some of the internal details and functions required vary due to the chosen but those are implementation details that i bother with during the design certainly helps me to know that for instance an authorization class might have an authenticate function that takes a user object as a i really care during design that i might need an internal string md5 function wrapper to accomplish some specific i find out about that while goal of initial design is to get organized so you can make progress with clarity and forethought rather than tearing out and reimplementing the same function 4 times because you forgot some scenario due to not i work in php a and i actually use phpdoc to do some of the design by simply writing the method signature with no then putting a detailed description of what the method should do in the method header this helps anyone that is using my class in the because the design is the i can also change the documentation if i do need to make some alterations while work in php4 a so i get to use in i create the then implement it

reason for the separate i think is due to the fact that you cannot have two msi installations running at the same therefore if your application requires prerequisites installed by the msi your installation will run into regards to setting up the framework you could in the project settings include the framework as a prerequisite of your application and will this get installed if not already present on the target you can further choose to package the installation or download it from the

reason this particular exception gets thrown is that the content of the element gets applied to the items so the xaml initialises the listview with a single in its items but when using an itemscontrol you must use either the items property or the itemssource you use both at the same hence when the itemssource attribute gets processed an exception is can find out which property the content of an element will get applied to by looking for the contentpropertyattribute on the in this case higher in the class on the intention here was that the view be set to a so the fix is to explicitly indicate the property to be the xaml and the exception goes was missing that	
reason you are warned away from static methods is that using them forfeits one of the advantages of objects are intended for data this prevents unexpected side effects from happening which avoids static methods have no encapsulated and so garner this if you have no use of internal they are fine to use and slightly faster to make sure you touching global data in them languages also have variables which would allow for encapsulation of data and static	
reason you probably want to do that is because these calculations are sql server is usually licensed by the cpu socket for for so dbas are very sensitive to any applications that want to burn a lot of cpu power on the sql server if you started doing statistics calculations and suddenly the server needs another an expensive licensing it makes sense to do these statistical calculations on a separate application query the data over the wire to your app do the and then send the results back via an update statement or stored more but as your application you be facing an expensive licensing

recommendation is to keep the database schema definition under source using the scm repository and as the rest of the code in the that way easier to keep the database in sync with the application that uses it would be embarrassing for the application to query a table that development typically is going on in different branches of source control version version and version early you need database instance per this allows you to modify the database design for version and as without interfering with the stability of maintenance work on version definitely need a separate database instance for versus i worked on an app that sent notification emails to i want users to be confused by spurious emails sent by my test in my test i changed all the email addresses to mock addresses at my own so i could verify they were being sent as many times as i needed without bothering i do that if i were using the same database for test and on your team should have their own including all components of the system as the that way each developer can work able to make changes and invoke debuggers and without interfering with the work of anyone else on the the other this may not be setting up a complete duplicate system for each developer may be too compare the cost of this setup work to the potential for gains in since developers have to coordinate testing with each other as

remember that you are creating a model of game that does not depend on the details of any operating your game depends on state management and algorithms which depend on the the key is to write your game logic without dependencies to specific libraries which means a lot of call directly you should write an or macro that can be changed based on the use dword when you can use a class or typedef that can be tailored to different instance if you where making a football then algorithms for throwing the positions of the players could be done completely in standard without platform if your encapsulation was good you could dump the state of you game to a file and display it separately with a rendering

say functional programming lends itself particularly well to flight in functional languages be very useful for writing scientific though this is a slightly specialised probably be better off with a standard imperative language like as they would tend to have the better physics libraries as well as graphics both of which you would need to use very the oop approach might make it easier to represent your another point to consider is that far as i the popular flight simulators on the market today are written pretty much entirely in my philosophy is that if no particularly good reason that you should need to use functional then use a functional language nothing to stop you using functional constructs in i suspect going to have a lot less painful of a development process using the apis for and languages more commonly associated with game development has many commonalities with flight if you want to add some complex ai to the lisp might seem like a rather more obvious though even then i at all jump for and if really keen on using a functional i would recommend you go with one of the more general purpose ones like python or even mixed languages as opposed to which could end up getting rather ugly for such a	
say i am tasked with coding some kind of an this means for want to track a and stats like damage bonuses or positively scared that by the end of the project i may end up with handling with very a high number of fields and for each i would have to make sure they follow a very similar set of constraint and behaviours i want them to be bounded between a min and a i want to be able to distinguish between a and a i want to be able to increment and decrement both without going through a setters and for every field i would need one getter and four setters and maybe a couple resetters even for 10 fields that means a lot of methods all dryness i have started encapsulating the logic of messing with those stats in so that i could write code such as or takes care the value returned is in i have even gone to such a length to create classes to group those fields but not the point right i hit in this problem while into most java textbooks say that each class should have private fields with public getters and that sounds good in and already built a whole class around an the idea sound as solid when you find yourself calling a getter to a much rather access the field maybe my but for me it is clearer and more problem with public fields is that giving up all control on for example at some other point in the by the following might like a subtle i should i really worry about i for one never plan to assign the directly i have documented in the javadoc that this is not something that should be but still i am new here so a bit i would like to hear what your take on this are the advantages of encapsulation so massive that i should go ahead and have getter getters and setter getters and so or should i take encapsulation in healthy measures and leave the as a i been trying to but just recently seen also a bit of and properties oh except in and a getter save me from a faulty how to handle a lot of fields and their encapsulation

seem to be two major ways of mapping to relational all the attributes from the parent class and all the child classes and put them in the together with a class is each object is serialized as one row in one one table for the parent class and one table for each child the table for the parent class table contains the class is the child class table contains a foreign key pointing to the parent class each object is serialized as one row in the parent class table and one row in the child class one really scale it quickly winds up with lots of nullable almost always and scary but it is fairly simple for small class two scales much but is more it also results in many more tables in your suggest taking a look at method two for your tables to they sound like child tables of a or you will then have a very clear and easy place to attach to the

seems like there are actually a few different issues here that should be the fundamental problem is trying to come up with a mechanism that allows an arbitrary object to be inserted in to an existing list at some point in the middle of that describe what the imetadataprovider interface actually looks but it should have some way to uniquely identify a provider option would be to use a the benefit over using the class name is that it allows you to rename the classes as needed during without affecting custom providers as long as you keep the guid the than using a simple list you should probably derive your own providerlist exposes a way for a custom provider to itself from that these mechanisms need to be smart enough to know how to insert the new provider in to the middle of the chain but also smart enough to know how to handle multiple custom providers which have been the removal process needs to be smart as well to deal with similar concerns and also ensure that someone try to remove one of your good approach here would probably be to pass the guid of the provider you want to be inserted after as a parameter to the the method would likewise take the guid of the provider to be say i insert a new provider after then another 3rd party also installs a new provider after what should the new chain order does the second provider always insert immediately after movieproviderfromxml or does it start there and then skip past any custom providers and insert after the last custom provider installed just before the next to that question is the idea that you need to have some way to distinguish between your providers and a custom you need to make sure there is a way to handle failures in the particularly when a custom provider is inserted in the wrong do want to always maintain a base list of your default when a new provider is installed in the middle of that a new chain should be created but you want to loose the base this gives you the ability to reset the chain back to the default based on priority is problematic in that you then have to determine how to handle priority as far as a attribute would you allow both on the same probably so it might make more sense to create a providerchainattribute that has a chaininsert enum where chaininsert defines before and after as enum this allows you to force the custom provider to make a decision as to whether it installs before after the specified i would still use a guid rather than the this gives you some other ideas on how to approach this

seems to be a popular question so provide an overview of what we did in our seems that services built in are following an older standard and axis2 only understands the newer standard the file provided is in a form that the axis2 rampart module the steps we had to in a the and try to understand then rewrite it into a policy that rampart could rampart with this the keys that were provided in the file and convert them to a java key there is a utility that comes with jetty that can do rampart with that key a custom axis2 handler that the newer stuff that comes out of axis2 into the older stuff expected by the axis2 to use the handler on outgoing the end it was a lot of configuration and code for something that is supposed to be an open standard supported by the not sure what the alternative you wait for the vendors in this the one to make sure that everything will a postscript add that i end up doing the it was someone else on my but i think i got the salient details the other option that i was considering my teammate took was to call the wss4j api directly to construct the soap envelope as the service expected i think that would have worked

short and simple answer if you adjust the base testclass no way you can modify the class to replace a method by once we started doing stuff like be in a completely different kind of like longer answer it depends on who is calling the replaced other see if you implement a in between them and the unmodifiable concrete whether this is doable depends on whether that class implements or is its own the class then your only option is to decompile and modify the at design time using equivalent or at runtime using have to be hurting pretty badly to go this as sure to be painful and you still explained what you are trying do and replacing methods on the go is powerful stuff in the languages that permit it there might be mocking libraries that can be twisted sufficiently far to do the reflection but then be skating on thin	
short answer is used subversion for a relatively large game development i will say it handled binaries surprisingly the downside is for now you will only get text information for texture to fit updated main character but even this little bit of information can save you when looking for performance issues and simply making sure that every one is using the same binary files for as far as i would require the full

short answer to your question the program variables are allocated at the very beginning of your before the function they will be released at the very end of your shortly after this memory management is handled by the and it all happens behind the you are trying to monitor this you probably have much for if you did the following in a custom and then used that class as a static member of another am being would never see this message appear in the there are a couple of reasons for the variables that requires may already have been deallocated as part of the normal shutdown and because the runtime system may simply release all of the remaining memory in a single without bothering to call the can be problematic if your custom class does something important in its if this is the consider writing a custom method which you call for these objects just before the program

should avoid all optimizations if the only belief that the code you are optimizing will be the only code you should optimize is when you know it is slow through a you write easy to understand code then odds are be fast and if it then when you go to speed it up it should be easier to being common sense should apply should you read a file over and over again or should you cache the probably cache the so from a high level architecture point of view you should be thinking of part of optimization is the that are committed in the name of making something faster those sins generally result in the code being very hard to i am not sure this is one of but look at question this may or may not be an example of optimization be the way the person thought to do but there are more obvious ways to solve the problem than what was thing you can which i recently did is when you are writing the code and you need to decide how to do something write it both ways and run it through a then pick the clearest way to code it unless there is a large difference in on what you are that way you are not guessing at what is and you can document why you did it that way so that someone change it case that i was doing was using memory mapped files stream the memory mapped file was significantly faster than the other so i concerned if the code was harder to follow because the speed up was case i had was deciding to string in java or doing so should save but at a cost of in my case the space savings and the time was so i do the documenting it lets someone else know not to bother interning it if they want to see if a newer version of java makes it faster then they can

simple way is that the player can update your via and that javascript function can be called every seconds by the flash function a video with id sets a cookie with a value of the var cookiedata videoid time the flash actionscript can invoke the javascript frequently to get a fairly accurate update of where the player was the last time the cookie was each time it overwrites the cookie with updated flash video player variables for video id and current player 5 will invoke a js function on the host page named pass in the provided you revisit the the first thing the server does is check to see if you have a cookie called of and if the value of that cookie is the position set last time you were viewing stated in the this is a very simple way to accomplish what i find the best way to learn is to go with a simple implementation and then add complexity once the simpler case is hulu likely makes periodic updates behind the scenes using if you watch the net traffic while watching a video using something like see occasional calls to

simply create the application context from multiple xml config files based on for testing without a the context is created by using all the config files in each service we access the services via spring and thus the client uses an application context that is initialized via an xml config which defines the proxy beans that enable meanwhile the services are confgured by the same xml files as used by the test but the application context is now loaded by either the dispatcherservlet or an ejb or setup allows us to tailor the application context for each scenario without having to duplicate any information in configuration which keeps maintenance much there is no hard dependency between config files via since that is handled at the layer above that actually creates the comment on the ide support since we are not using it

single eclipse workbench can create multiple each window is laid out using a so different windows could be set to different or the same and you can switch perspectives in each window independently of the other can also set input for each this is useful if each window is working on different data each window could be connected to a different server or could be showing data from different databases that all have the same schema but different may be that you are using windows only so that you can see different perspectives of the same data on different in that case you do not need to programatically create the windows but need only add the action supplied by the this can be done by modifying your actionbaradvisor to the field iworkbenchaction to the code where you make the actions a method called newwindowaction to the code where you create the menu is typically the window if you have a window menu already in your application and would like to create the following line will menumanager menu new will give you a menu item that will create a new window in the same way as the window menu item in the eclipse on the other you want each window to show different data then you will need to open the new windows this allows you to set different input for each you will need a line of code something newpage inputobject contains information that identifies the data shown in the if you want to set the initial perspective this can be done by calling setperspective on the will want to set the title in each windowtitle is a string describing the input to the can fetch the input for a window as can then cast this to whatever class you are using as your window	
single time you program in a language you allow the compiler to do work for and over time you come to rely on things that you have little or no knowledge of the inner workings a managed language like c or you have to spend time thinking about where a pointer will point to at the end of a whether to pass by reference or return a and other things that make you think about the code writing in a far more objective thing the ability to know things like whether using a vector or an arraylist in java is the right way to go can never be learnt until you understand the fundamental concepts behind many of the data structures you use on a learning to use c or will make you a better but whether you choose to take this knowledge and use it to make you a better is your

slow and tests when you but get dismayed when you spaghetti code is rarely testable that everybody who edited the code before you had a good reason to do what they assume the best of and you will likely be the code before you attempt to change the notes as you and keep them up to date as you keep and share them on a wiki if you a revision control make each change as small and focused as and check in as frequently as bite off more than you can as you are making one you will no doubt find something else that ought to be cleaned add it to your to do list and remain focused on your original the project like a leave it in better condition than you found and remember that is you fix everything at	
small improvement over brett code	
smells like a is right say your 3 points are and you get three linear a b c and similarly for the other two rows using and in place of this system of 3 equations will give you a solution for and	
smells like so let me suggest how to and then you can come back with how far you need to be able to iterate over the or at least to jump forward characters along its can you think of a construct that allows you to either iterate each character until iterated or that allows you to split the string into substrings characters	
so after some investigation it appears that clearing the cache with in ie7 does not the xml file that the flash object reads appears to check if the file exists and if it will use that file instead regardless if a newer way to get around this was to make the browser treat each request as if it is requesting a new file and so i had to generate a random number and append it xmlpath if there are flash component you can also do the same by appending a random number to the flash swf file that is being	
so first the answer to your assuming you have some structure like public class public string the original type type currtype node thisnode string while methodinfo mi if propertyvalue new propertykey if return currtype to its base currtype return public class othernode new public string return says public class testnode implementation of getintrinsicproperty above will do what but i would suggest that forcing a child class to exactly replicate your signature and a developer to understand what you this is what virtual methods are if understanding you correctly the proper way to do what you want is public class public virtual string case return call on return public class othernode public override string switch case return the and i know call on return public class testnode static void node node new var prop1 var prop2 var prop3 node new prop1 prop2 prop3 idea of virtual methods is that the type of your variable determine which implementation is but rather the run time type of the object determines far as i can the situation describing is one where you are trying do your own dispatch to the implementation of a method on the runtime type of the pretty much the definition of a virtual i get the question please

so i got datacontractserializer working with my object see my previous questions for more one of my is defined as shown it defines a list of custom properties that this user can add to objects in the data the string is a unique key to identify the and type is the type of the property which is always a primative type like string etc object has a corresponding object collection to store the values it has set for any of the object graph serializes fine when this property is an empty yet once i add a custom property to this collection i get the following exception when trying to serialize with with contract is not add any types known statically to the list of types for by using knowntypeattribute attribute or adding them to the list of known passed to i remove the datamember attribute for this field the i can with out getting an but of course i loose the settings created in this is not	
so if you get a native compiler and toolset up and running on more power to realize will not be able to use a language that compiles to bytecode and the apple will most likely not allow any sort of interpreter through the app are your tools will not contain an interface builder equivalent or an iphone simulator going to be writing a lot of code and spending a lot more time have local either have to use website or rely on documentation which may mix app and methods without indicating which are have which is highly specialized for have to type a lot be able to get help as easily since not using the same tools as will never know when a bug is in your your or your people using the official sdk can file bug reports on the tools just as easily as the tech support incidents are because violating your apple ever find likely to be kicked out of the app store and all your work will be for unless an this thought will worry a these may be acceptable to avoid paying for a used mac but if not a is no way to run a pick up a used mac and think of all the money spending on a a or employees during your setup	
so is just the way of specifying the with the abbreviated attribute syntax you just specify the query	
so it turns out that the default implementation of the function works differently depending on whether the referenced script file is on the same domain or external references such cause jquery to create an external script which can be debugged with no if you reference a local script file such as any of the jquery will download the script content asynchronously and then add it as inline script latter approach does work with any debugger that i tested ie8 workaround is to override the function so that it always creates an external reference rather than inline here is the script to do i have tested this in and ie replace the normal jquery getscript function with one that debugging and which references the script files as external rather than var head var script handle script var done attach handlers for all if done if handle memory leak in we handle everything using the script element return	
so much duck typing as it is just proper being able to subclass class a and call the same method on class b and have it do something else is the entire point of inheritance in constantly checking the type of an then either being too clever i suppose this cleverness that duck typing aficionados except in a less brittle or not embracing the basics of	
so often i now found been looking at this for the last 20 hours or only to find it 5 minutes after posting the question the solution i found and which helps me for now is to use the loaded event of the in the i have the following for i i scatterviewitem svitem new all came to me after reading this helps anybody	
so often i see a question on so which forces me to spend half an hour editing a really bad wikipedia the article is now only moderately in the part that bears on your i wrote as computer a function or expression is said to have a in addition to producing a it also modifies some state or has an interaction with calling functions or the outside for a function might modify a global or a static modify one of its raise an write data to a display or read call other or launch in the presence of side a behavior depends on past that the order of evaluation because understanding an effectful program requires thinking about all possible side effects often make a program harder to effects are essential to enable a program to interact with the outside world other computers on but the degree to which side effects are used depends on the programming imperative programming is known for promiscuous use of side in functional side effects are rarely functional languages such as standard ml and scheme do not restrict side but it is customary for programmers to avoid the functional language haskell restricts side effects with a static type only a function that produces a result of io type can have side

so something i wrote for an except for the closeevent instead of the minimize is an overridden qt so it must be put in the class that implements the window you want to is a function you might consider implementing a boolean flag you might want to since sometimes you actually want to exit the application instead of minimizing to is also an example of how to your window traysignal if asked for if reason	
so spent the afternoon looking into this and it seems i have two both of which i have mocked and both of which just unsure which is best if i outline my maybe someone can tell me which is better the methods in different grouped logically dependent on the class they came it is possible to include multiple soap in the same wsdl file so they can still be discovered by clients by visiting only one the methods into different on the same soap confused about which to use since according to the spec a port is abstract set of operations supported by one or more whereas a service is collection of related this suggests that the correct way to group together operations is by using can someone relieve me of my in	
so that for your cpu you only use this type of assembly to to your languages eventually convert to instructions that are executed on real whether that is done fairly directly as with an assembler or through a high level of abstraction as with the tricky bit is actually getting the machine instructions to manipulate the hardware in ways that you want since one point of higher level languages is to shield you from the hardware like are designed with the intent to manipulate hardware directly and so they include keywords like volatile to prevent the compiler from otherwise optimizing away references to device these may be written and not read back so that the compiler thinks the value saved is never used or it may be necessary to read a device register though the value is never there are also miscellaneous instructions for such operations as enabling and disabling interrupts that an ordinary program will not may also require linker support so that memory locations memory mapped can be located at the correct addresses for device however some processors use distinct instructions for and there must be some facility for inserting them in the code so in many cases it may not be possible to access unless there is explicit language with most modern operating systems like windows and applications are run in virtual memory where program addresses do not match physical address and the programs are usually denied access to the code that tries to access hardware when the os has not granted it specific permissions will generate an return to the os and no longer

solution by while noble and well has a few so i thought provide my own problems with the tilde in expand to your homedirectory inside and neither when read by the statement or quoted in the which means get such file or off and such for basic operations is especially when using a crappy shell to avoid the weight of also noticed a few quoting for instance around a parameter expansion in his the solution cannot cope with filenames that contain no solution in can cope with them which is why i almost always prefer far more bulletproof harder to exploit when used using for your hashbang means you must avoid at all you can use all the you even on ubunutu or whatnot when honest and put at the a solution more probably and more echo exit the quotes around in the check will also fail if is so two checks in avoided regular expressions for a if you must use in you should be putting the regular expression in a in any globs like mine are always preferable and supported in far more bash

solution makes your system dependent on javascript to a more robust solution is to build something that is at least without and then on load use javascript to modify the behavior of the buttons to do something more requires more code to do it that way and as but if looking for the you may want to weigh in and determine whether handling the is a priority or ever route you you should at least consciously make a decision one way or another instead of letting it surprise you later

solution with examples in python as a good substitute for pseudo a grid 20 x that the tetrominoes fall are made up of which have attributes of coordinate and for the tetrominoe looks like 4 5 6 7 8 19 20 the is a collection of blocks with the coords the shape is a matter of applying a simple transformation to all the coords in the to move the shape down add left or right to all coords in the collection that make the also lets you use some simple trig to rotate the shape by the rule is that when rotating relative to an then becomes equal to is an example to explain taking the from use the as the centre block to rotate for make this the first coordinate in the here is a simple function to rotate that collection of coordinates by shape for selecting the x and y get the middle middle work out the coordinates of the other blocks relative to middle rel for coords in now rotate for coords in return if you apply this function to our collection of coordinate for the this out in the coordinate system and it looks like 4 5 6 7 8 18 19 20 was the hardest bit for hope this helps

solution would work for your but having done some more research my preferred solution is a using interfaces and extension has several i have to fiddle about with the autogeneration mechanism of the linq classes in vs2008 to support the new base not enforcing an inheritance hierarchy on my linq i just add an interface to the partial class declaration and suddenly all this shared functionality arrives at the if i could put the extension methods in their own namespace and clients could swap them out for other appreciated on this	
solution you go with also is dependent on how compliant you choose are to be with the java ee jpa is for data access in java ee so if particular about adhering to you should use it some is a standardization of mapping as it does not provide an it simply defines a standardized hibernate entity manager is one such jpa is a standard across multiple vendors and since it is still fairly it lacks some more esoteric functionality that is valuable in some use cases a criteria api for generating dynamic if you go with jpa plan on situations where nee to use hibernate or even jdbc for situations such as a generic dao pattern is very you can modify this data access for use in jpa jdbc quite has some difficult restrictions if used to and imposes certain approaches on you that are difficult for developers who are more used to writing straight if you are championing this as an be sure to do your homework about the pros cons of orm you go with once reached the learning curve it will pay off in terms of simple development if you properly implement the abovementioned dao but also in getting caching of query if done properly big i i have seen this provide handsome if you have a legacy data model that you have little flexibility hibernate will give you more headaches than maybe for the database does not have candidate primary keys effective hashcode equals you will need to do upfront analysis on which columns define a row uniquely maybe maybe complex depending on the complexity of your unable to add version or timestamp you lose ability to do optimistic and end up having to query before in response to first if lucky enough to your two very considerations if going to using an a version number column to all relevant tables to support optimistic your data decide on that developers should use for use pk columns in those

sounds thing you might want to throw into your authentication algorithm is the ip address of where the user is coming might not be so great for current user authentication but in the event a session is a different ip would be a huge flag but you can use that information to add to an ip tables rule for blocking potential malicious other thought is to track the referring in regards to malicious seeing where someone is coming from for any consistencies may shed light of holes in the program

source control providers have the ability to particular check ins of code as you check them several even have the ability to take these and turn them into an rss i find this kind of thing useful everyone gets a view of the kinds of things people are working which leads to a better awareness of been up to what and might know why it makes people who comment properly stick and the peer pressure results in better

source of a hint to distinguish among vc versions is the specific c runtime library since the default case is least in the modern to link to the this is fairly easy to the utility is almost indispensible for verifying that you know what dlls are really being and it will tell you which c runtime dll is in although dependency walker is included in the microsoft platform it has been extended independently and the site i linked is the home of its current and mingw both link to by so this distinguish between with some mingw can be made to link to the later c runtime versions as so you will need to independently rule out vc vc8 vc9 runtime dlls would be good clues references to runtime probably indicate the exe was actually built from and not a c toolchain at symbols been stripped from the then you might find some clues from which internal symbols are for a reference to something like probably indicates that a mingw gcc configured for exception handling was involved at some

spent most of last week at a university library studying debugging of concurrent the central problem is concurrent code is academic debugging has fallen into one of three camps this requires an event monitor and then reviewing the events that were in a ut this would involve manually sending the events as part of a and then doing this is where you interact with the running code with a set of x this could be interpreted into a ut framework where you have a system triggering a given test on a certain this obviously work in an automatic testing as above commentators have you can design your concurrent system into a more deterministic if you do that just back to designing a sequential system suggestion would be to focus on having a very strict design protocol about what gets threaded and what get if you constrain your interface so that there is minimal dependancies between it is much and keep working on the

stop custom formatter might only be slightly more efficient than the but you can add more features to your own implementation that would make it more did a similar thing in and here are some of the features i added just format the method accepts either a varargs array or a map be a so my format strings can look like f quick brown jumped over the if i already have my objects in a map is pretty i can call the format method like s i have a special syntax for performing regular expression replacements on strings during the formatting after calling all space characters in the object string are converted to f blah blah blah blah i have a special syntax that allows the formatted to check the argument for applying a different formatter depending on whether the object is null or f blah blah blah blah are a zillion other things you can one of the tasks on my todo list is to add a new syntax where you can automatically format and other collections by specifying a formatter to apply to each element as well as a string to insert between all something like wraps each elements in adjacent elements with a f blah blah blah blah the syntax is a little awkward and not in love with it the point is that your existing class might not be much more efficient than the framework but if you extend it to satisfy all of your personal you might end up with a very convenient library in the i use my own version of this library for dynamically constructing all sql error and localization enormously

sudden changes is part of agile and this may mean that some people have to go off and learn new course this is more within the general agile philosophy than anything there may be some extreme cases where the customer or business decides to change the world by bringing in something new and thus has to handle the subsequent pain of those people ramping up but if this is what they want and the developers are then there are only a couple of your lumps and try to handle the major or and get out of there can be some cases where someone that has specialized in something may be able to do things this necessarily mean much if that is just one person on the team that is an expert and there is enough work in that area for 10 people for the whole should those not an expert simply not do that work and let that one person attempt to get through as much as he or she i think so but there should be something to be said for those that the best at something still trying to get done what they can get

take this as a criticism of your the choice to require javascript is certainly yours to make though as others have mentioned you may need to be concerned about accessibility you might find it to develop a web site that is friendly using mvc rather than new ajaxhelper extensions make it almost trivial to include code that relies on ajax for most but work in the absence of javascript in the obviously the experience is degraded for people who have it more if you use jquery plugins for etc but it is still the framework provides a pretty easy mechanism on the server side to determine whether the request is an ajax request or not so you can respond appropriately by rendering a new view or sending back as know that found it much easier to write accessible web sites using mvc than i did with

talk to a very wide variety of the potential clients and find out their what they are currently using and what they wish their current could spend 10 times as long at this as you think you need to right draw out a potential guis on paper and have the people you interview look at the drawings and make if at all hire some people in the industry as business analysts to help with this ask about legal some industries have a lot of legal complicance issues and others do anything related in any way to the medical world and you will need to research and fully understand hippa for the database structure and a gui then get some real users to play with refactor based on what they say amazing how many things users leave out in requirements gathering that they think of until faced with an actual about what needs to common through all the potential customers and where you might need customization your interviews should guide you decide how to handle or even if you will allow this may depend a great deal on the industry and how standard their practices this is box often the design includes a table with customizable fields that can be added to forms and reports by the a often each user wanting customization may have their own database where the custom information is stored a central standrad database for the noncustomizable and the programmers make the changes based on requests from the if you take this the second time you do a simliar customization for a second consider if you need to refactor to make this a new feature of the software available to no need to write 17 custom attendance reports that vary only by one or two fields when the client can for less money have a standard the web you can also create a bunch of modules and have the clients pick and choose which to add to their custom they would pay based on the number and complexity of the modules they so the client that wants only three of the standard reports would pay less than the client that wants all when a new customization is the client pays for development if the suggestion seem to immdeiately apply to but the module is done so that others can buy it as if others buy the orginal client who asked for the change might get part of the money until their development costs is they could also require that something remain as a custom module and pay a much higher price for this we have some clients who even want their data on the same servers in the same location as other needless to we charge a huge premium for doing something like is expensive and can lead to many more programmers consider very strongly before you go the customization it can really be the thing which sells your software but it scale it bad when you have ten cutomers but when you have a couple of hundred it can get out of control very it is a lot harder to back off of customization once you offer than to add customization later from a standard often the need for customization is more in the organization of corporate if you can create a reporting interface where people can pick and choose what information they want and save their own custom you might handle most of the customization needs in your industry without customization

that particular post i was refering to shrinking the dictionary in order to be a more appropriate size for the number of the hood most hashtables are backed by a large array which usually points to another structure such as a linked the array starts out at an initialize when the number of elements added to the hashtable exceeds a certain threshold of the number of elements in the the hashtable will this usually involves creating a new array at twice the size and the values into the new of the problems features of a weak reference hashtable is that over time the elements are over time this can lead to a bit of wasted imagine that you added enough elements to go through this array doubling over time some of these were collected and now the remaining elements could fit into the previous array is not necessarily a bad thing but it is wasted compaction is the process where you essentially shrink the underlying data structure for the hashtable to be a more appropriate size for the

that this is for a you probably care about a lookup table is definitely the fastest but you trade accuracy for speed with this so how accurate must you be to meet only you can answer before you trade determine first if you have a speed all of the trigonometric functions are calculated using numerical methods numerical analysis to learn some trig functions are have more expensive methods than others because they rely on series that converge more slowly and who your computer may have different implementations for these functions than another at any you can find out for yourself how expensive these functions are by writing some small programs that loop through as many iterations as you with increments of your all the while timing the then you can pick the fastest

the general the most efficient implementation for any algorithm is the one which has the least amount of this is for many code less time to write lines of code means less bugs bugs per kloc is pretty constant for a given which are easier to find they hide well in a few lines of your algorithm fit for the easier to replace when 10 lines instead of compact implementation usually leads to clean interface which makes the code which the library clean the effect this can also lead to a more complex library implementation if that makes the client code more efficient you concentrate the effort in a single place to make everything else more also depends a lot on the access do you always walk the whole is it do you prefer to process rows or the extreme case with a billion rows and columns with only 10 cells a can be more efficient than any array for other it can be more efficient to mix the approaches depending on the problem a of arrays of when cells in a gigantic empty your problems asks to locate a and then process those it might be more efficient to use a 2d so the first access returns an array which you can then process without bothering about

the guy who was here a while back about controlling windows media player via made but hit a vexing so back looking for followed the advice i got last time and installed i execute these lines out of a test wmp new and wmp pops playing i got this one that when i interact with this object after its it seem to have anything to do with the wmp instance when i execute this wmpsettings i get an output seems innocuous except volume of has nothing to where the player volume set volume of the player change after tried other properties as but the same the value of the properties seem to be related to what the player is actually and while changing them seems to alter the state of the being it has no affect on the actual get the exact same output each time i run the so whatever it is altering when i twiddle it have any persistence outside of the doing something but fumbling around blindly trying to figure out can anybody offer me any insight into going or what i ought to be trying not even certain is the right input i experimented with entries in in the registry until i found this thanks in advance for any help anybody can i found a package in the offerings from a company called ez it failed in ways so identical to what i was seeing before that either just a wrapper for or the wmp interface is plain why did i say chatted with customer and they wound up demonstrating how you can be helpful without actually being they helped me correct the sample code they provided as an example of their wmp code in but when i pestered them for some insight into how the volume methods are supposed to i got but there is no wmp expertise available here ez jcom is just a bridge builder between java and other programs like in mind the package of theirs i was evaluating is actually called had i gotten it to i would have had to talk my boss into for the one wonders what charge if they actually had some expertise on their own no real just thought still poking at my current operating theory is that in order to get at the volume need to access wmp seen mention of the iwmpremotemediaservices and iserviceprovider with the queryservice method of the latter providing a pointer to the not having any luck figuring out how to get a hold of seen mention that accessible from the windows but i figure out how to get a hold of that since the word figures pretty heavily into google is giving me a hellacious if anybody has any advice on how i lay hands on the com object representing love to hear this is on an xp my research is suggesting that merely talking to the wmp object is you need to wrap it more tightly than that so it can talk a wmp sdk with a lot of but it appears to rely on microsoft visual extensions to the code that i have and not giving away for i done in twelve i know possible with but if going outside of need the solution to be a standalone executable and installed on the relevant per answer i dug the constants out of and tried the following which makes use of the int int findwindow new wmphandle media window sendmessage new playresult 0 catch pauseresult 0 gives me a result window but actually affect the media also tried it with which gives different return values but do anything i really need to get the individual commands to work for this to be a viable simply toggling the state blindly help me since i know what state the player is in when i anybody have any advice on what doing wrong or what else i might media player ignoring

the intel software developers manual it says that interrupt vectors are usually user defined for external io in my systems programming class i must develop a simple device my question is how can i define a specific interrupt vector to be used for a specific is this done with the we are developing a simple operating system so my situation is quite in the end i need to understand how this all happens on an x86 currently our system is set up so that a few interrupt vectors above 32 are assigned to devices like a serial port and in reading the datasheet for the intel 82801eb ich5 io specifically the section concerning the 8259 it says that irq15 is the secondary ide how would that eventually be put on the stack as a interrupt may just be so confused that this question make so i apologize in so our systems programming class has a very simple which has kernel routines for installing isrs to handle specific interrupts given the vector in our class last quarter the professor gave us a header file that defined the keyboard as vector number 0x2c or something i am trying to find out how to map the primary secondary ide channel interrupts to various isrs using our kernel for all of the unused interrupt vectors have a default handler that would print messages if an interrupt so ide interrupts even on at the however that is another do i identify device specific interrupts on	
the interface you are looking for may be called user according to paper of the same by andries van the reasons why we need other paradigms is that wimp is not good especially for some specific applications such as 3d model those who think that ui research builds only but first was bulky and it took decades to be also douglas the thought people would use both mouse and short form keyboard at the same this shows that even a pioneer of the field had a wrong vision about the we are still in wimp there are diverse comments on how the future will be most of them must be please search for these keywords in google for more by in this users show what they want to do and computer will learn new user guess everybody knows and has seen many examples of this interface despite a lot of hot debates on its a part of 3d interface ongoing research has been implemented into many leading operating the state of the art could be see user this interface may use the same hardware setup like wimp instead of users command through strokes which are user is ike surface or but it have to be on the interactive surface can be say or not user has already been mentioned in another this can work well with touch a set of computer vision or augmented user user by jakob nielsen is another seminal paper on the

the kicker is that the numbers are technically generated inside the so anything you do to the will affect the from the elements in css generate one principal block in this we discuss two css mechanisms that cause an element to generate two one principal block box the and one separate marker box decoration such as a or that both the marker box and the principal box belong to the element in this the list we should all styling to apply to both the marker and the is also not surprising if you think about it as though the list itself is generating the numbering content effectively it doing in css this is confirmed later on when the spec list properties allow basic visual formatting of as with more general a element with generates a principal box for the content and an optional marker the other list properties allow authors to specify the marker type or and its position with respect to the principal box it or within it before they do not allow authors to specify distinct style for the list marker or adjust its position with respect to the principal because the marker belongs to the it is affected by the styling and adjustable the only way to achieve a different styling for the marker is to insert a inside the list and style the span with the properties you want to be different from the

the library that generated the xml used a relative url for the dtd rather than a fully qualified as such the xmldocument is using an class to convert the relative path to a fully qualified by default it uses an is a concrete this will try to map the location of the dtd to a location it thinks is relative to the xml trouble where is the probably in memory which is not relative to anything and the xmlurlresolver is using the process location instead which in your case is visual studio which is located at visual studio what can you well i suppose you have to crate you own xmlresolver that inherits from xmlurlresolver an overrides the resolveuri method and does something having done that you will have an xmlreadersettings class and set the xmlreolver property to the class you just an xmlreader using passing in your document and the xmlsettings an xmldocument and call load passing in the xmlreader and the xmldocument property of your xmlcontrol to the that is all a bit of a so if it where me i would just use to remove the dtd declaration from the document before processing it into you are feeling really brave you can create a resolver that inherits directly from once you have done that you can override the method and then you can get the dtd document from wherever you i wrote one once that got dtds from files embedded as resource but i have the code any more

the original answer below is really dealing in terms of if the sequences are short all the calls through building a etc will actually be more expensive than using in that case both calls will be really pretty quick other definitely scales better as the two sequences get but for if absolutely that the sequences are the nested loop solution will be will be faster than the solution but as casperone will be faster than because it will exit as soon as it sees an sequences of length n and intersect will be whereas the solution is builds up a from the sequence takes and then loops through the outer sequence takes yielding any element which is in the these results are streamed the inner sequence will be evaluated when the first element is requested from but this only goes as far as finding the first match using have an if there are any so we need to take the overall number of matches into consideration when working out the results from linq rocks well worth getting your head round well as deferred

the perspective of a cross java accessibility how would you link to a package but only optionally execute an action based on of a package already at think what interested in here is a way to resolve the identity but rather than the issue being beetween 2 apps sharing being a service loaded at a higher level of the class seems like reflection is the way to but i am not sure how or if i can implement a derived class this i need to add a specific listener derived from the specific optional i can load the listener using the applet class loader but the internals still say you wanted to add an but swing guaranteed to be using reflection you can find the method to add the but how can you create and have the frame listener work if it cannot find any of the related classes because they be found in the base do i need to create a thread and use setcontextclassloader to the classloader that knows about swing so that i can get the class to be loaded simply trying to set the class loader on my existing thread seem to description of not quite sure what to ask or how to make this so it rambles on a a class uses some feature of but the other class may not always be available say finding the website from jnlp if this is a jnlp one stage i thought that simply compiling against jnlp would mean that my class would not load unless jnlp was and so to identify this optional section i simply wrapped a noclassdeffounderror around something changed changing jdk or i and it seemed that i should also use a classnotfoundexception i wanted to extend this idea to other optional but it seem to work i wanted to add some feature to do something more advanced in a runtime using the same jar and classes as i run in a or say i want to handle some controls in a specific gui toolkit which may not always be used like swt or there some way of doing this more it just seems wrong to cause an exception and catch it to ignore it all the current issue comes down to being able to compile against but then the accessibility component installed in ext is unable to access the classes even though objects from the package have been if i throw the into the ext directory to test then the accessibility component works up to the point that the whole lot gets flakey because of the different versions of the same seem to be caught up on an issue with the class loader not being the right one or something how do i find the right answers so far are kindof interesting but not quite getting me where i want to the case of the gui components i currently compile in the form of a factory something public icomponentnode inode component component component instanceof formdesktopcontainer does stuff here like return new component catch noclassdeffounderror a it prints out and then throws and exception on the instanceof call with noclassdeffound thus printing out how can it have an instance of a class yet not be able to find to link to a package but only optionaly execute an action based on of package at

the polygons are always first calculate the angle of a line drawn from center to center of the you can then eliminate needing to test edge segments in the half of the 180 degrees away from the other eliminate the start with the polygon on the take the line segment from the center of the polygon that is perpendicular to the line segment from the previous and touches both sides of the call this line segment with vertexes p1 and for all vertexes if the x coordinate is less than and that vertex can go in the it you have to check to make sure it is on the side of the line check the y coordinates a line segment in the polygon has all vertexes in the you can ignore the polarity so you are for the second

the previous answer below for it depends on the implementation of the but under the current ms this actually only creates a single instance which is reused for every able to do that because delegates are immutable and that delegate require any information from the know whether this was the case with you can decompile your code and see whether the il actually uses a cached field or using the answer below is a safe way to only create one instance it creates an instance of a that will take some you could reduce that static class public static readonly eventhandler empty delegate sealed class public event eventhandler loggingin that point just be the one and you can refer to it from the downside is that other classes could then unsubscribe using the same if you trust the rest of your codebase not to do this is probably the best bet from a memory point of

the reason for the this is extremely any given method should achieve exactly one thing creating different functionality for refresh and order within the method suggests to me that you really have two methods which should be broken into two perhaps both call a common third but then again struggling to imagine why you would want to refresh the form posting if you really need this you can introduce a timer with preferably into the newly divided method but if you continue with the existing implementation then i guess in the onclick attribute though now it gets write something like though that settimeout is asynchronous if you want a real method need to write one yourself these are processor but expensive and again i doubt you really need the return false is also deeply likewise with the mouseouts and is this

the rigidity of clear interfaces mean that flexible code must be use java and perl as respective not that code being messy makes it but that code being flexible makes it almost has a different meaning in exploratory code vs older perhaps talking about thanks to mario pays much attention to the content of the language and standard libraries are steeped in oo and it even has the extensively used keyword the jvm and language themselves have specifications of external has a history of clear and open specifications a clear interface that works well is very difficult to do but when done the result can be very a specification an oo is by its nature rigid any flexibility it has is rigidly circumscribed by the result is that if you correctly predicted the the degrees of freedom the design has great clarity and precision it will actually act as a towards the right questions to and give you useful terms with which to think about the spirit of perl is more than one way to do and the language syntax itself has evolved considerably over the years incompatible like this attitude carries on into programs written in the one can write perl to clear it and often this can result is code but if you understand you can change it in arbitrary that it is ugly but flexible perhaps my definition of ugly needs to mjd said of order that he have written it with because it would lack the flexibility he i hope not putting words in his mouth but i think the same would apply to interfaces and specifications that is something that tdd seems to me that java code tends be neat but and perl code to be messy but java upfront and perl favors my code i keep facing a choice between neat for i compared a visitor pattern against one big function of cascading latter is but it is many times easier to add parameters to the recursive method calls is only a problem if you need that degree of flexibility i find i do in exploratory the visitor pattern refactors the as method at the cost of defining and calling those one class per so that an added argument must be added to all those methods and all the calls of in all those i coded these designs and counted how many places needed arguments 9 places for visitor different 3 places for in one the solution is much easier to even though question about java and perl just using them as illustrative examples to make the question more concrete and and hopefully easier to arbitrarily flexible code necessarily being arbitrarily flexible make code

the thing it is about or or at some place in your writing a method to do say a public it should not assume much or anything about the caller it should merely do the job it is supposed to regardless of who is calling it and what context the caller is for some it cannot complete its then it needs to tell the caller i do and exceptions are an excellent mechanism to let it tell the caller that the only but the best mechanism ever seen for most when you throw the you have no idea whether it will be caught or not because exposing a public method and you have no idea who might choose to call it and catching of the exception is the job of the for say writing a library with public methods that might throw say using that library from a windows forms the windows forms app might catch exceptions and show a message box to the you might use the same library from a windows the service would be more likely to catch the log return an error to the original but keep running so it can process further the exception is like a contractual agreement between the caller and the the provider either do the job or tell you why i what you do from there is your own and the caller if you do the just tell me and decide what to do in that

there are a ton of resources out best advice to start is to find a pattern that you feel comfortable with and stick to it for the there is nothing worse then changing your mind the way that i have found and like to use is the repository or provider the repository pattern just makes sure you have standard access to like your store catalog or cms you create an interface that in my case expose sets of iqueryable the object or the data model are just standard classes with now extra fluff poco old clr interface icmsrepository void just implement the interface for your different like a linq to sql making sure to return the poco objects as the nice thing about this is that you can then make extension methods off of the iqueryable to get what you need static int return from c in qry select you to chain repository and filter to delay sql new sec nice thing about using the interface approach is the ability to test and mock it up or dependency inject your preferred storage at run method i have used and is used in the framework a lot is the provider this is similar except instead of an interface you create a singleton abstract your implementations on top of the abstract class will then define the storage access means flat the base abstract class will be also be resonsible for creating singleton based on take a look at this for on the provider you can look at similar

they find any strong business case or advantage i think a company will agree to spend time on what is the also internet explorer 6 is little faster than the new versions and business users care about the version as long as it does the may you are a developer then you have the reason to have browsers thought mine was the only one to use internet explorer 6	
they have been using they might not be familiar with the mvc architecture to begin with and you might have to talk about that a little they are all developers and you have only 15 i would suggest you show them file new for mvc project and briefly talk about the a big sell for mvc in that it works off the go and you are already set up for iterative that you could switch to a working demo of a simple for this i would step through the application with a debugger from routing in to controller action to model and eventually back up to the this will bring up interesting questions and explain the new application life cycle including this will also implicitly highlight the differences between mvc and you have wfetch fiddler or live http then i would show the client side request as well and highlight the absence of view states and highligh the verbs if you are using maybe mention the usefulness of this in ajax questions on how to migrate the current app and what the value proposition is for your current	
thing check is the colour material as mentioned by then check your texture file to ensure a reasonable size something like and an rgb if the file has even a slight problem it will not render no matter how you stop trying to just debug that code and instead see what you have different to the on the nehe is always a good place to check if trying to do stuff in textures are probably the hardest thing to get and they only get more difficult as the rest of your gl skills

thing i like about postgresql over mysql is that it has a slightly more open licensing	
thing to be aware of is that a dicom is not necessarily just image the dicom file format contains much more than raw image this may be where getting hung consider checking out the dicom file standard which you should be able to find linked on the wikipedia article for this should help you figure out how to parse out the information actually interested	
thing to keep in mind is that the string itself might be static string where result new if typeconverter conv result catch return	
thing to remember about gae is that it works differently than a standard python install and apps you have may not work well at in that the biggest difference is the while there are advantages to the database available with you need to treat it differently and there are many things that your code may be expecting your database to be able to do that it you are starting from scratch on an either platform would work if you have an existing python getting it to work on gae will take considerable	
thing you can do is to trap for the esc only your main screen is in the screen stack the esc key is you can then clean up your you can register a systemlistener to listen for callbacks to kill threads or clean up is also a good place to clean stuff when your app is	
thing you could do is change so it makes better use of enum sortdirection descending void sortdirection if list list you can specify the field to sort when calling the e	
thing you could instead of sending the send back an html page with the the not sure if it would fix your it really depends on how the browser the value of comes from the request header which the browser is free to send or not at its else you could do send the referer url as a query string then you can access it as this is probably more reliable than relying on the browser to send a referer	
thing you want is prolly its direct port from unix	
things being and in the most simple which is a call to a web service method a call to a assume that you have a simple web service that just returns an integer that is calculated in x you also have a database when queried in th right also takes x time to calculate the the time is the same in both in both assume the amount of data both directions is the a single for the calculation times of both the web service and the database are exactly the environment is 1 application where the app and 1 other server that is holding both the web service and the there is nothing else going on in the environment other than the application calling either the web service or database all within one single so any network latency is an which will be the call to the or the call to the web i am trying to i is which is more does the set tear down of a database connection end up slower than that for a web or is it the if there are other such as parsing the result from a web how do they affect the is the speed difference between database and web service

think as long as the contained class is only used as i use this sort of construct for example to define complex return types for private	
think both are good languages with coherent and concise design and both would be a great choice as a first language to learn some other commonly suggested being i feel that either of these make for a great web development language they both have several drawbacks for that will probably use inside which is a mess that will not allow you to learn neither good general programming skills nor good web programming skills i do believe the skill sets do not overlap all that as a web development platform is also bound tightly to microsoft technologies and i have my issues with ruby you will probably use ruby on rails which is a great mvc framework for web development but it has its own issues and is also very unlike current web development techniques as they are used in it is also rather you want to learn general programming and design some desktop or server either would be a great choice though i will recommend you want to learn web then i suggest going with a more industry standard and also not a really bad language which is java using if you only plan on ever using one tool and be done with then either are good choices and i would recommend ruby on my answer above is relevant if you want to be a good programmer and use this experience as a base for learning other	
think but there are a few that prevent you from clearly expressing those ideas i nominate

think have to split manually unless you are interested in doing it a that does though it mention the max size of handled xml when doing it the first problem that arises is how to open the file would recommend a very simple text editor something like when handling such large it is always useful to turn off all forms of syntax highlighting options worth never tried it with anything this but if anything like other jgsoft it should work like a remember to turn off syntax used this with files of 1gb in works as if it were nothing at

think hurt later if you want to add a language later if you normalize the database a word table where the word is in the default it has an a language table with an id and a translation table that has the word the language and finally the actual word in that this is the linked a view for your but for inserts and depending on your you may need hard is just assuming trying to provide and thus are likely to add more languages doing it this way is easier than having to modify your database to add columns every time you add a you really only need one translation and highly doubt ever need then just adding the one column would be	
think i figured it out some code elsewhere in the app uses xml functions such functions are likely executing in another thread at the same time i am executing the code fragment i nsxmlparser obviously uses the same functions under the added a synchronized block to the other code using the same lock object as the one i use for my nsxmlparser and the crashes seem to have gone so i guess the lesson here is that these xml functions are totally not use with

think i read the question a little so hopefully this response too off can get a good overview of how much memory your application is consuming by using windows task or even sysinternals this is a quick way to review your processes at their peaks to see how they are of the an x86 process will only be able to address 2gb of this means any single process on your machine can only consume up to in your likely to be able to consume only before getting out of memory much ram your copy of windows can actually address will depend on the windows version and cpu your example of 4gb the os is going to give your applications up to 2gb of ram to play in all processes and it will reserve 2gb for on the operating system your you can tweak using the switch in the will adjust that ratio to 3gb for applications and 1gb for the this has some impact to the so review that impact first and see if you can live with tradeoff a single application to be able to address greater than your going to need to set a particular bit in the pe image this has good info on this subject game changes under x64 good reference limits for windows address	
think i understand what you want to but if let me you can make your abstract base class partial and pull the implementation you want up into that you could take your abstract class and encapsulate the functionality you want your child classes to have access

think it is because getsearch is implemented in so it uses the fields from if you use shadows not in legacy you should ask yourself what you are doing it is this design has a both cases of inheritance b from a and searchb from searcha are kind of misusing kind of inheriting a cat from a dog because the as jamie ide already you should use abstract base a abstract baseclass and inherit a and a interface isearch implemented by searcha and searchb that by the base a classical strategy generics if you need a typed references to searcha or need factories to put things

think it very much depends upon your if already familiar with something like mvc makes much more if you have been doing websites in html and css for a long mvc is much better as you have full control over your html comfortable with just keep using not going away	
think it would be best to separate pages into gwt if you will use to check if specific slot or other exists your module will hold all of your so client will load whole only accessing one page which well be unnecessary can place common code in some module which all of your pages modules will inherit is better for you to have sets of widgets panels in your ui main and you can place them in proper slots on structure in your app would look like question in common widgets common images images css expenses entry point reports entry point that you can use one service in all as well in common module you might have to create entry point not in some old project i had to create empty entry but remember exact reason worked for certainly would like to hear different	
think its because the two machines usually would need to be optimized in different other than that i have no we run all our applications with the on the same machine granted not public facing but had no imagine that too many people care about one machine being compromised over both since the web application will usually have nearly unrestricted access to at the very least the data if not the schema inside the in what others might

think know how to do this in but having syntax trouble in because i need to take advantage of the event have different events that i somehow need stored in a property of an attribute just add an attribute to a property linking to the corresponding readonly property as return end need to be events so that other programmers can use the handles keyword on delegate sub sender as byval e as event e as sub handles properties are already raising a general which i am determining the related property and thus getting the related attribute i want to then raise the event i just use a delegate tied to the particular event that raise other handlers will also want to avoid having to write a sub for each property that just uses raise event on the event type if possible as this seems event e as sub sender as byval e as raiseevent readonly property as return end and invoke an event	
think largely a design i think a although i guess if you were sticking to the letter of the pattern then you would go for the started to put together a small prototype blog system to try out mvc a little while ago a and one design decision i ended up making was to subsume the comment controller into the post i only decided this after having tried separate i think this worked because the two concepts are so tightly you have a comment without a blog	
think leaning toward and as a concentration language for learning web i would like to learn good programming fundamentals and looked at pretty much everything the four narrowed it down to have been ruby and is there a reason to stay away from i think the cost issue would really apply to my situation but i could be totally any realize that these are all great languages so not trying to ask which is the best would ruby be a viable alternative for a first language or does it have too much under the coupled with and unorthodox i do like what seen with the there a reason i should not start with

think part of includes knowing malicious but at the same you necessarily need to know all of the techniques in order to defend against them knowing about attacks the reason to try and protect your buffers from you protect them from overflowing because if they it could wreak havoc in your program regardless of whether a bug or an you write very thoroughly checked and well architected then the malicious attacks will be unable to because good architecture should automatically lock out and unauthorized that last paragraph assumes that we have a perfect job where we are given incredible amounts of time to make our code since such a job then knowing the malicious techniques is a good because it means that although your code you can create for those exploits to make sure that they do not get those make the code and they make the application knowing malicious exploits is something that is good to be aware but of them will be covered by simply making sure you adhere to best	
think pretty much summed up the pros and seaside hard to set up installed it twice for various but using it will definitely affect how you addition to the language probably have to adjust lots of assumptions about your work also depends on two other other people will eventually be maintaining have better luck finding python you are doing a highly stateful seaside is going to beat the pants off any other framework

think that a good way to answer this question would to approach it from the other what practices make xslt and of the things that seen that result in ineffective of said saying it i find that is often a sign of the developer trying to employ traditional programming techniques in a declarative a lot of bad xslt seen exists purely because the developer understand axis and and so he implemented logic using xslt constructs you can sometimes eliminate an amount of xslt by providing your transform with for an xml document contains data that has to be parsed using xslt string often much simpler to do all of the parsing outside of xslt and either add the parsed results to the xml or pass the parsed results as an argument to the seen some remarkably unmaintainable xslt implementing business logic that would be trivial to implement in or biggest problem that running into in my own xslt world have several line transforms that is dead certain that there are templates in my transforms that will never be used because the conditions testing for will never arise no way to determine programmatically if something like is alive or because contingent on something that metadata tell	
think that also think sort of answered your own because you point out how silly it would be to use them everywhere everything is a regular or to avoid using them at the have to make an intelligent decision about when regular expressions will help the code or hurt when faced with such a two important things to keep in mind are maintainability implies and those that are particularly averse to my guess is that never learned to use them i think most people who spend just a few hours with a decent tutorial will figure them out and become fluent very my suggestion for where to get that page talks about regular expressions in the context of found the information is very applicable there are a few things that are but i believe they are clearly and easy to

think the ideal solution would be to have the data layer throw a specific exception in this perhaps a subclass of sqlexception for or something you want to be able to treat different exceptions then you have to throw different exception types to begin think this is an area where the spring framework gets things really they provide very rich hierarchy of all of which extend with of types for integrity etc this leaves your client code free to catch any of the exception types which it can handle or care exceptions that indicate an error that may not be repeatable if you the a fatal or you can simply catch the root	
think the important thing to remember here is that each table in your might have multiple these are the wikipedia entry for candidate all candidate keys are created they are each unique identifiers for the table in job then is to select the best candidate from the pool of candidate keys to serve as the the primary key will be used by other tables to establish the relational but you are free to continue using candidate keys to query the primary keys are referenced by other and therefore used in join the criteria for primary key selection boils down to the following for me order of primary key values should not if they you run the risk of introducing update most dbms platforms require that the primary key are not simple datatypes and values for physical storage and integer values work well and this is the datatype of choice for most identified the candidate the criteria above can be used to select the primary if there is not a candidate key meets the then a surrogate key that does meet the criteria can be created and used as mentioned in other

think the most important thing with your backing beans is to seperate their if you have a front page for a cms system i would see it as bad practice to put every piece of code into one bean bean would turn very large easier for other people to find what their looking for if they are troubleshooting the login if they then can easily just look up the you have small pieces of functionality that is clearly distinct from the rest of your by separating this i would imagine you would make it easier on yourself to this code into something when you already have a nice bean with good 1 big to do it will make it more memory dependant you have to do declarations like this mybigbean bigbean new instead of using the funksjonality you actually needed by doing loginbean loginbean new me if im wrong my separating your beans is like separating your you dont want 1 big method which runs over of but rather split it up with new methods that handles their specific most likely someone other than you will have to work on your jsf projects for the i dont see it as a troublesome issue to allow your jsf pages access too the properties in objects in your this is support which is built into and really just makes it easier to read and build your allready separating the mvc logic by doing this your saving yourself tons of lines with getters and setters in your for example i have a really huge object given to me by the web where i need to use some properties in my if i were to make a for each property my bean would expand with atleast 100 more lines of variables and methods for getting the by using the built in jsf functionality my time and precious code lines are my 2 cents regarding this even with the question already marked as

think the question has more to do with the concepts involved than the answers to the and internalize keeping unrelated pieces separate its important to get real reuse on different related technologies help you on its you that separate the app in appropriate which you can appropriately reuse for different endpoint for communication based on known protocols allows implementing different pieces with different the operations flow like independent actions based on different gives you a lot of places where you can add is a particular of the overall process using lots of resources and the server take it just move to a separate load kept and that server taking it add an additional server and load you also have more opportunity to use caching and connection a critical that needs to be available all the add a server so you can have a fail have an overall process that needs to be all the use queues for pieces that can be processed you really need to support that type of set appropriate targets that relate to the specific if you really need to support that type of i recommend you get someone on board who has dealt with it is something for a load that might eventually identify the bounded contexts and design the interaction between those with a soa keeping the code clean is all you have to do for the use loose focused integration etc in your code with good if you later need to separate pieces of the it will be a lot	
think the simple solution will be to create a fake instance of the singleton class and use swapnextinstace before the actual class constructor is void var fake set additional behavior on singleton this is where the class constructor is being var result result solution should work with most scenarios unless the singleton class is created before the you need to set behavior after the class was created just use void var fake var result result

think their explanation sums it primary reason we created fan to write software that can run on both the java vm and the the reality is that many organizations are committed to one the other of these look better than all other in the absence of any information about them blog is just an error i see no reason why they would necessarily get this righter than language starts out fairly elegant for the set of things it was designed for i see some awkwardness in the little fan code i looked at just the real question is how well it scales to completely new and we simply know that if your organization has a rule that must run on our then it may be an acceptable compromise for giving up an awful lot just for vm for yours is the first fan question here on so a couple of fewer than what problem is fan the best python and ruby can already run on both vms have big communities and big and seem to be about the same level of but are far more

think this depends on the application your if building a cms and the usage of the data is going be to display images within a web it might make sense to save the images to disk as opposed to being put into the although honestly i would do which could allow adding a server to a farm without having to copy files all over the use case might be a complex such as a or even a business object with lots of you could serialize both of these into a binary or text based and save them in the then you get the benefit of the think people should be using queries in the first what you do is provide two ways to get the one methods returns the summary the second would return the i imagine why you would need to return thousands of images all at	
think this has to be the most frustrating thing ever done in web yet one would think it would be the easiest of all things in the world to that is need 2 separate lists of radiobuttons on my one set allows a customer to select an the other set does also but for a different but only one set can have a selected tried this using 2 radiobuttonlists controls on the same got around the nasty bug with groupname assigns the uniqueid which prevents the groupname from ever working because 2 radiobuttonlists have the same groupname for all their radiobuttons because each radiobuttonlist has a different uniqueid thus the bug assigns the unique id as the name attribute when the buttons are since the name sets are they are not mutually so i created that custom radiobuttonlistcontrol and fixed that groupname when ended up happening is when i went to put 2 instances of my new custom radiobuttonlist control on my all was swell until i noticed that every time i checked for or not matter which i was the value always spit back and i was not able to figure out why onto the third try tonight and into the break of dawn i tried to instead just scrap trying to use 2 custom radiobuttonlists altogether because of that issue and try to spit out 2 sets of radiobuttonlists via using 2 repeaters and a standard input html tag got that ok but the 2 lists still are not mutually i can select a value in the first set of radiobuttons from repeater1 and same goes for i cannot for the life of me get the to be mutually exclusive sets of mutually exclusive radiobutton

think too early to say whether symbian going will be a good or bad thing for the the debate over the branding selected for the symbian foundation website shows a certain lack of clarity of the role symbian software will play in the true to say that there is an entire ecosystem that knows about the specifics of developing for symbian pretty meaningless in its own after still an active that knows how to develop cobol applications for ibm need to consider the size of the ecosystem and appreciate that that ecosystem is small given that symbian os has been around for over a decade and the software powers in excess of 100 million devices consider then the rate of growth of the ecosystems surrounding the offerings from google and apple symbian never generated that level of excitement and never saw that sort of growth in developer of a decade down the line and you could argue symbian have done the hardwork and created the landscape in which google and apple are now but just because symbian was make it best and give it any right to is true to state that the symbian idioms are a pain to it is incorrect to suggest that there is no justification for getting rid of the justification is the persistent 10 years that developing native code for symbian os is too most if not all these painful idioms were design decisions taken over a decade ago and whilst still beneficial on todays mobile devices are no longer mobile hardware has moved on substantially in the last symbian os has not fundamentally at least in terms of the developer consider now where pcs would be if the hardware had developed as it but the software stopped at windows or we almost certainly be able to have this discussion in quite this way for at alternative mobile consider android and both are linux based both use more developer standard development approaches which leave symbian os looking like come from another in itself is not necessarily a problem because as others have symbian os supports several runtime environments that make development for mobile devices that happen to run symbian os much more approachable for the average the runtime support to its natural the underlying os becomes a choice made by the device manufacturer based on time to quality but the end user care and in many cases know what the os developers then develop for their preferred rather than write native not at that conclusion still travelling the long therefore native code still plays an important part in mobile hence the ease with which developers can write for a given platform is important assuming the device manufacturers believe in supporting developer will open sourcing be good for difficult to see how open sourcing will be bad for but whether it will be good or not depends on the ability of the community to make symbian os into the os the community	
think using a boolean flag is fine you need to cascade the flag to related entries at the db you just need to keep referring to the status of the this is what happens with user remember marking a user as not prompt django to go through related models and magically try to deactivate rather you just keep checking the attribute of the user corresponding to the related instance if each user has many and you want an inactive bookmarks to be just ensure that is unlikely to be a need for an flag on the bookmark	
think we need to know a bit more about what you are looking can you clarify your question a in particular does the service to work across all one or a particular the numbers be unique or just on your question there appear to be a couple of different items you may be looking a sequential group of numbers across all processes on the no such service one should be fairly easy to write but getting it to work across all processes is a unique sequential group of numbers across all processes on the variation on the first such a service does not exist because it would be impossible to there is no way to guarantee a unique sequential number using the data types simply because the value will eventually overflow and leave you with a duplicate a method of getting unique values in the several other users have mentioned the best choice is a you can create a new one using for almost all purposes they can be considered unique but are not	
think what describing will work you basically the same thing as a publishing but there appears to be a according to from the sharepoint solutions team not related to you can create a publishing customize it as deactivate the publishing create a site template from create a new site based on the and then activate the publishing feature on your new sounds like this but is not officially supported by be since it may mostly but i be surprised if some small pieces of it	
think what you are asking for is quite an efficient way in a web login purpose is to provide an easy way for to gain access to your services and should be easy and fast to so you should not make a user wait considering of the them will not be also has the potential to place a huge load on your server should there be a lot of concurrent users trying to log potential options would the ip for the end of the session for x number of unsuccessful login a course these are not the options but still i am sure more people will have more

think you are misunderstanding idea behind using unions is toe save one and get result equivalent to not they looks similar in source but it is a completely different like apples and are a very low level construct that allows you to see a piece of memory as if storing any of its but you only can use at a even the use of the word is extremely they should be called or not you int double char are a piece of memory big enough for the biggest among an a char and a and lets call it that now you can store an a a if you store an and then store a the int is gone the point are two major uses for discriminated what we did i pick a piece of memory and i give it different meanings depending on sometimes the context is explicit keep some variable that indicates what of variable you and sometimes it can be implicit of the section of you can tell which one must be in either the code needs to be able to figure it or you be able to do anything sensible with the typical example would int typeindicator an a a abcunion are unions not unlike the above more split is sometimes useful when you need to be able to see a variable as either a or as a combination of easier to explain with an unsigned char unsigned char short a short int with a pair of you can view the same value as either a short int or you can just as easily study the individual bytes that make part of the value and that this second use is not portable pretty meaning that not guaranteed to work across different machine but this use is absolutely essential for the kind of tasks for which c was designed	
think you can also use transactionscope as long as you pass the datacontexts the same connection you issue you get with transactionscope is that it care if the connection string is the doing a second will elevate the transaction to a distributed and then you have to deal with the related and also the fact that it using the light transaction that is what is needed for that

think you can run multiple commands in one ado just need proper line feeds between something like vb from whatever vblf mystring from somethingelse myquery	
think you can unify all of these because you know what is being used by each you identify which ones you are interested in then you can get each to output to log files in a central location linux for from here you could write a simple utility that parses each log file and massages the data into a single log file in the format that you the awk utility is very good at doing this sort of you could leave them as they are and use something like splunk to index the files for future searching and it really depends on what you require from the log files at a later hope that	
think you can unload a set of properties defined within the scope of a a workaround would be to define the functions contained in each file in a central object that you scrap whenever you want to get rid of

think you have the label turned you might also want to try using the signature with the value parameter in not sure why you were having a compile since there is a version of the extension that takes two string can be found at cascading you might want to use jquery instead and get json pairs for the next menu based on the selection in the first add an onchange handler to the selects and do an ajax to an action in your controller to get the new i construct a list of key value pairs and return that in a in the success handler of the ajax i take that result and replace the contents of the appropriate select with new options using the returned	
think you have to use some libraries like gwt because we learn more when we see how to use the code of other and doing some ui is far more motivating than writing console funier to manipulate checkbox than double not so much

think you need to look at your upgrade paths for your the fact is that at some point when they have 16 core cpus going to want concurrency to speed things so you have a business case to move away form vb6 and towards wcf has built in concurrency and synchronization it can be used for local communication as well as and it also has the benefit of allowing you to do more aop style

think you probably need to split this logic into two parts and check for null static bool if return if is return as return static bool if is return return null the isnull relying on the fact that valuetype objects be null by definition so if value happens to be a class which derives from we already know not on the other if not a value type then we can just compare value cast to an object against we could avoid the check against valuetype by going straight to a cast to but that would mean that a value type would get boxed which is something we probably want to avoid since it implies that a new object is created on the the isnullorempty checking for the special case of a for all other comparing the value already know is against default value which for all reference types is null and for value types is usually some form of zero these the following code behaves as you might public class public string mystring static void int i1 int i2 i3 i4 string s1 string s2 string s3 string s4 myclass mc1 new myclass mc2 public static void t public static bool public static bool	
think you return nil on the second alloc but raise an if you want to use a singleton you should not try to create two if i decide to create a singleton my class looks id if return you can see i am not enforcing that there may never be more than one instead i am using the convention to get the instance only with the instance

think you should just use radiobuttons instead of an that presents a solution to resolve the radiobutton naming	
think you should take an approach to capture codes when you problems with the function call of if your subsequent computation depends on what the function if you are pretty sure the call cannot result in errors you have no use for the return value even skip capturing the return is one of those areas where an engineering not some prescribed is to be relied the same thinking i believe would apply to exception	
think you should use codecompiler for that there is no need in reflection or shelling out csc as all the required support is already provided within out the microsoft support to programmatically compile code using also take a look at the namespace at you will need to perform some googling in order to find samples that suite your code generation had been discussed a lot so you have problems finding might be also interested in automating of your source code generation so t4 is also worth looking refer to blog to find out all details towards t4

think your idea will probably valid identifiers are made up of and which is in fact a proper subset of xml identifiers add and a bunch of unicode characters to the could try a construct like this to get a compile time int name braces limit the scope of the dummy variable to just that so you clutter your function with bogus probably the compiler optimizes the dummy variable out so no runtime when i use this macro in the following i get invalid int name char int 30 int bar return i replace with in the call to it compiles with no	
think zf has more going for it based on your the cons listed against zf are rather but the cost of is definitely a rich community working on zend framework and its release came well over a year so stable and framework supports a two step where a view template is rendered inside a layout i think this satisfies your need for master seems you have equal love for php and if i was making the work with whatever most confident or which would be most relevant for the	
thinking about an idea for as well as learning ruby on rails eh i want something to allow a user to generate forms as then assign these templates as forms in a location in a tree then allow users to fill in instances of these forms and save the got two different thoughts as how to structure the currently thinking a template will have one or more and a section will have one or more fields and the field will then have attributes validation should this be described as linked tables section should i have one template that has a field called body that can be serialized in and out to xml or something to render ideas or comments even if totally on the wrong way to structure data for user generated form

this for a real or is this a convenience thing for you to view output in the if more so for you could consider using is an extension for the apache webserver that embeds a python interpreter in the web server the script runs server it would easily let you do this sort of thing locally or for your own then you could just run the script with mod python and have the handler post your you could probably easily implement the refreshing but i would not know off the top of my head how to do this check out not too bad once you get everything

this have anything to do with the fact that you have a surrogate key in the storeproducts table happens if you remove this surrogate key column and put the primary key on the combination of the and columns believe if you want to have a surrogate key on the storeproducts have to create yet another you want to use the surrogate have to use the idbag does your product class and mapping look like see that you specify the attribute in your mapping of the products collection in the store you do this thus you have a then you should add the store to the stores collection of the product as the nh made only to the inverse of the association are not this means that nhibernate has representations in memory for bidirectional one from a to b and another link from b this is easier to understand if think about the object model how we create a relationship in the category now about the the item now about the no nothing will be the relationship will be side is used to the representation to we would get an and probably even foreign key violation if both trigger the same is of also true for may map a association by mapping association to the table as a association and declaring end that only one of the ends should be a product to a should be done like class public void product p false class public void store s false important to check whether the collection already contains the item to be otherwise end up in an infinite	
this i think you need if is it you can pass that to insertbefore and it will act the same as no other element allowed inside a tbody than i i work for multiple once done one will now point to the row you just end up inserting all your rows in reverse need to remember the original if is a live dom every time you insert one of the rows into the new it removes it from the old you are destroying the list as you iterate over this is a common cause of other you process item 0 of the and in doing so remove it from the moving item 1 down into where item 0 next you access the new item which is the original item and the original item 1 never gets make a copy of the list in a normal if you know going to be a live you can actually use a simpler form of have to insert a when you think about inserting a set of elements at you want to be using a you set on a so have to set the rows on a table like then move them one by one into a then insertbefore the whilst this could theoretically be faster than appending into the final target table to less childnodes in practice by my testing it actually reliably significantly approach is an ie only extension you call insertadjacenthtml on the child of a in the same way as you set due to the ie you set it inside a somehow insertadjacenthtml works very slowly in this context for some mysterious the above method is about half the speed of the insertbefore for

this is an someone logs a bug at microsoft complaining that their finalizers running when some nasty code makes the process exit so that problem gets then someone else logs a bug about how there seem to be a way to force the process to exit instantly so that finalizers so microsoft adds a new api to allow that so another person demands a new kind of finalizer that always runs even in response to that new kind of and so it would probably be easier to change the code than to try and rely on who is currently winning the arms	
this is but you could really do a lot to make your code more make a struct and then redefine its type to be a pointer to just asking for trouble when it comes to usually a bad idea to hide the fact that pointers are because when people see something like students return forces us to assume that returning a struct that was allocated on the which would be obviously not necessarily but a wasteful get even hairier when you add your of one as people assume that with no students is a full structure on the this will make anyone that sees do a double not obvious what while squishing assignments and comparisons into one if statement is perfectly valid c and usually not the most readable much newstudents p malloc if return people enjoy pointing out that casting the return value of malloc necessary in but it is in for your valgrind report your catstring but still pretty sketchy since hiding the memory using snprintf is a more idiomatic way to create the string you leak valgrind is it looks like just freeing the first node in your you need to traverse it and free them probably like p students next free p

title was definitely the tip of the hope not way off base here on my testing of wcf services can be done many different using test tools such as microsoft team borland silk mercury or something like loadgen or a custom test my preference is to try to take the approach that done in creating some sort of functional unit test and then feeding data into that while using the test tool to spin up multiple concurrent instances of that test the tooling of most commercial test tools really facilitate this type of testing so its difficult to go wrong the biggest challenge usually grows out of maintaining the test cases and test data to support testing the have any built in counters related to thats actually a blind you can see how many connections are being made to the but this is coarse information and you probably want to know which services are servicing those rumor is that as part of providing a rich hosting environment for will include surfacing performance counters for the hosted we will have to wait and see what actually shakes i needed to instrument a wcf service without impacting the existing codebase look into how much mileage i could get out of a wcf behavior that i could apply to the this custom behavior could likely surface the performance counters you might i would care about results of a functional the caveat is that there is likely some startup which can be probably look to profile the execution of a functional test to get execution metrics but not turn on code profiling during a performance again custom behaviors might be the you could log operational metrics to a database and then report off commercial products like amberpoint and soa software will provide support for this as well performance requests to a wcf i immediately think of especially if your looking to make the request

to extend this a remember that arrays are c so all you have is the address of a piece of memory that purports no to be an array of expand a little therefore really have as all it has are so when you make something an what really happens is you tell the compiler that some variable represents an useful to make a distinction in c between a and a in a simply giving something a name and a in a you actually allocate if we start off by definiing an array means telling the compiler we want space for 100 we want it to all be allocated in one and going to use the name for the operator gives the number of bytes used by a type or an so our array will take up on most that will be 400 but it varies from machine to we define a using as a reminder this is a defining space for a variable that will contain an its size will be which will usually be either 4 or but on some machines could be anything from 2 to 16 on some machines unlikely to run into of the array is the compiler converts that name into an so we can save that address ar this say for convenience that our array happened to be starting at location 1000 in name does have any space allocated to like a a you reverse that this the same reason you this work you change the value of in early versions of this trick would for complicated it was a never lived until tried to debug a program in which the value of is in c are always that the first index is always any other indices are just addresses computed using the is just the address 1000 plus 0 bytes of or is 1000 plus 1 times the size of an so the int and in this is always true in is called an we use the syntax telling the compiler to get the thing at the address contained in is called a we and refer to the same we say telling the compiler we want the thing at the address 0 bytes from is the address one or 4 from refers to the same thing as need the parentheses because we want to add 3 to the address first and then look at the would get the contents pointed to by and then add 3 to thing c or much how big the array really if i come along and do the compiler will happily generate code to look in the cell if in your but if just random fine c c comes from the phone we have the phone we know some which moved down read as equivalent or the same you can depend c know a difference between pointers and you can declare either when you define a you can get exactly the same was anywhere you might write you can replace it with actually a weird side case that breaks but you run into it as a will equal the address at plus this above as when you index into an like it means you want the 42nd whatever over from the start if using then you need to move over 42 times however wide an which is to say all and since is defined as a it all holds for as is a user defined type that overloads and you can decide you want to define a new type that acts just like any other but you can change the way the language does specific a programmer decide to replace the default behavior of the array reference and pointer dereference operators with something of their own as a you be confronted with that but you should be aware of

trying to export classes from a dll that contain objects such as and the whole class is declared as dll export class problem is that for members of the complex types i get this class needs to have to be used by clients of class able to remove some of the warnings by putting the following forward class declaration before them even though not changing the type of the member variables class class like the forward declaration the for when the member is compiled but is it does it realy change anything when the client compiles this header and uses the std container on his will it make all future uses of such a container possibly not and does it really solve the problem that the warning tries to warn this warning anything i should be worried about or would it be best to disable it in the scope of these the clients and the dll will always be built using the same set of libraries and compilers and those are header only using visual studio 2003 with the standard std update like to target you more though as i see the answers are general and here talking about std containers and types as maybe the question really we disable the warning for standard containers and types available to both the client and the dll through the same library headers and treat them just as treat an int or any other does seem to work correctly on my if so would should be the conditions under which we can do should maybe using such containers be prohibited or at least ultra care taken to make sure no assignment copy constructors etc will get inlined into the dll general like to know if you feel designing a dll interface having such objects for example using them to return stuff to the client as return value is a good idea or not and why like to have a interface to this maybe the best solution is what neil butterworth suggested creating a static classes containing objects from a

trying to understand how grep works in this the code works but not sure in what sequence the events take place or whether correctly understanding being returned when and do do i think is happening define an array of call the collect method with a block which causes each symbol of the cars array to be converted into a string inside the returns an array of is invoked on the array of strings returned by collect and grep calls its own block on each array matching the search causing the element to be uppercased and returned as part of an returns an array of uppercased assigning it to must be converted to a string before being far as step is which of the following best describes how grep grep finds all strings matching the grep calls the block on this array of grep returns the results of the block to the invoking grep finds the first string matching the grep calls the block on this this return value is piled up somewhere grep searches the next element of the if it grep calls the block on this grep adds this return value to the temporary of return grep looks at the next array element until it finds no more then grep passes the stacked up return values back to the invoking seems to make more seems like a lot of unnecessary fudging and seem efficient or i understanding the sequence of events in this ruby grep

turns out to be a pretty deep area of but the basic outline is a hash function is just a function that takes things from one space strings of arbitrary and maps them to a space useful for indexing you only have a small space of things to you might get away with just interpreting those things as and done 4 byte got a much larger if the space of things you allow as keys is bigger than the space of things you are using to index or then you possibly have a unique value for each when two or more things hash to the same have to handle the redundancy in an appropriate way is usually referred to as a and how you handle it or will depend a bit on what you are using the hash implies you want it to be unlikely to have the same and you probably also would really like the hash function to be these two properties a few has kept many people practice you usually should be able to find a function that is known to work well for your application and use to make this work as a imagine you care about memory then you can create an array as long as your indexing set for as you add something to the you hash key and look at the array at that if there is nothing you put your value if there is already something you add this new entry to a list of things at that along with enough information original or something to find which entry actually belongs to which as you go a every entry in your hashtable is either or contains one or a list of retrieving is a simple as indexing into the and either returning the or walking the list of values and returning the right course in practice you typically do it wastes too much so you do everything based on a sparse array the only entries are the ones you actually everything else is implicitly are lots of schemes and tricks to make this work but the

two can actually be used together quite think of patterns as recipes with specific code to implement the design intent that is the and there can be many by mentioning a pattern name in your code letting a reader in on your intent when you wrote that the implementation is method gives you an with replaceable algorithm is normally defined in a method or private for gof implementation of this concept uses inheritance and method overriding to replace those still using template method if those steps are replaced by think about a class that wants to walk a binary tree inorder and at each intent is that the method is a template method the structure of the walk is always the the part that can be implemented as a method in the same class overridden in subclasses to change or in which case a strategy for	
two classes are not mutually exclusive you can use both of them if your needs you picked bufferedinputstream is about reading in blocks of data rather than a single byte at a it also provides the convenience method of also used for peeking at data further in the stream then rolling back to a previous part of the stream if required the and provides convenience methods for certain data for it has a method to a utf if you were to do this have to decide on how to determine the end of the string with a terminator byte or by specifying the length of the is different from as the method sounds only returns a single deal with strings that string can have as many lines it it as it is suitable for most text processing if doing something special like trying to serialize the fields of a class to a want to use as it offers greater control of the data at a binary that

two parts need to answer one if how to communicate between the two processes gui and the process executing the and the other is how to change your function so it responds to asynchronous requests been told to just return whatever out the answer to the second question will probably dictate the answer to the you could do it by signals which case you get a signal handler that gets control of the can look for more detailed instructions and change your internal data structures before returning control to your or you could have your function monitor a control interface for commands check to see if a command and if there see what it the first want ansi c signal handling in the second probably want a pipe or similar and

typechecking arguments in python is not it is your code accepts either a string or a dict your design is comes from the fact that if you know already the type of an your own then doing something wrong hurts code reuse and reduces having a function different things depending on the type of the object passed is and has a behavior harder to understand and have the following saner make a function that converts dicts in unique lists of return your function assume the argument passed is always a that if you need to pass a string to the you just you need to pass it a you your best it is easy to understand and the code immediatelly understands what is and you make two one that accepts lists of strings and one that accepts you can make one call the other in the most convenient can create a list of strings and call any it is completely unnecessary and has only refactor your code instead in a way you need to only get benefits in doing both in short and long

types can be set to null since reference type variables is just a pointer to the actual indicating the lack of an instance is easy since you can set the variable to null value types this is a bit harder since a value type variable always contains a the use of or was somewhat valid in the back then there was no easy way of expressing the lack of a value in value with nullable types you can d thus you can also have value type variables containing is a different story since it is directly tied to expressing the value in this was introduced before nullable types which imo supersedes	
types in are and is a which can be assigned to a variable or field to indicate there is no other types in are value there is always a value with a value so no ability to indicate therefore an implementation may define specific special values to indicate often the value field is used for so using for a date of birth can indicate or for a corporate exists to express meaning of which is a little different to in most cases this will be translated to null or is a wrapper for value types to more directly express and is generally a better option than using but was added in so older designs may have started using before is

unclear what problem trying to you can definitely obtain a hash for an entire image and use that as a key in a trie although i think in this case the trie structure would give you almost no performance benefit over a regular hash because you are performing a hash every time you do a you are implementing something where you want to compare two images or find similar images in the tree you might consider using the gif or jpeg header of the image as the beginning of the this would cause images with similar index to be grouped near each other within the trie you could then compute a hash for the image only if there was a collision multiple images in the trie with the exact same

used maps to map lecturer and course ids to that sound very and in java have trouble if you try to not be sounds to me like the sort of application where you will want to maintain bidirectional links between lecturer and each course has one lecturer is that always so course has and each lecturer has a container of courses with you need to maintain external tables to store the lecturer course or their in java the objects themselves can be stored directly as everything is really a this is to be used in anything approaching a production environment then you will want a database and i can recommend the hibernate mapping system using for automating much of the database cascading query pooling but if this is just a pedagogical then that will be far too and if using this in maybe having a look at some existing course management virtual learning environment see the bottom of for some

valgrind states that a value is not then in it is really not when compiler reports use of an uninitialised value in you check for inline as your uninitialised value can be declared not for example 10 levels of inline function template than actual gcc does the but in so you should check whole path in which uninitialised value travelled from place of being declared not to the place where actually the path can be for cascade of function where each function passes its arguments possibly uninitialised to next will report in last when the value is actually you should not ignore what valgrind valgrind is not a simple trace can be seen as a virtual is in essence a machine using compilation dynamic nothing the original program ever gets directly on the host valgrind first translates program into a simpler called intermediate which is a after the a tool is free to whatever transformations it would on the before valgrind the ir back into machine code and the host processor run even it could use dynamic translation the host and target processors from different valgrind recompiles code to run on host and target cpus of the

variables or constants are allocated on the their existence lasts only during the function execution and their value is lost as soon as the function allocation and assignment take place each time the function is a local variable or constant static means that its value will be kept from one call to the this is achieved by allocating it globally instead of on the allocation and assignment are performed only which in case of big data structures in frequently called functions may lead to performance	
variadic function is only weakly type in the function signature does not provide enough information for the compiler to know the type of each argument assumed by the this is on win32 and on it has to vary in size like that in order to perform its defined so for a variadic function to pull arguments out correctly which are of type the caller had to make certain that the compiler could tell that the argument was of that type at in the calling is a constant of type there is no defined suffix letter that marks a constant to be of type you could hide that fact inside a but that would be no clearer than writing at the call appears to work partially because of the actual calling convention used in from the examples we can tell that the first four integral arguments to a function are passed in and the rest on the that allowed count and the first three variadic parameters to be read it only to you are actually standing squarely in undefined behavior and really does mean anything can other anything can happen variadic functions are implicitly a special burden is placed on the coder to make certain that the type of each argument known at compile time matches the type that argument will be assumed to have at run some cases where the interfaces are well it is possible to warn about type for gcc can often recognize that the type of an argument to match the format and issue a but doing that in the general case for all variadic functions is

want to follow up on answer and describe my experience having done it both ways several an integer has been been done with the convention described by tpdi a given number of seconds past some point in time around when a lot of production software was at least partially written in this mode was the standard and a reasonable number of functions were provided for mapping and date issue not discussed much above is that interpolations by and second are not equally by all languages and dbms dates handle this more nicely without worrying about rounding errors at least as long as you need a resolution less than 1 also helpful to not need to deal with dates before although it can be handled without too much trouble with negative final benefit can be that most have a feature for handling this which makes it easier to use multiple languages and dbms products with fewer compatibility some reasonable cases as but it can also be turned on its head you can lose precision and compatibility through libraries that handle integer datetimes if they fit your

was a little surprised that i find this question on principles should i consider if i want to incorporate elements of someone website into my other the web is a fairly open in the sense that the dominant and javascript are distributed in source if you see something cool on a you in look at the source and copy and paste the bits you in i seem to remember reading somewhere that html was designed this way to foster innovation in page but on the other someone put in the hard work of designing that website and translating the design into just common decency to give people credit when you reuse significant portions of their and perhaps the page author holds a copyright on the page source know exactly how copyright protection applies not a so how do you balance the ease of using parts of other web pages with the rights of the page reason i ask is that i was recently advising an acquaintance whose company wanted to redesign their they were very impressed with the home page of the mit department of architecture and wanted to do something i suggested that my acquaintance contact mit and ask whether they would object to his company using the same look and feel as the of after a couple of weeks he got no so now is it ethical legal for his company to just go ahead and take the design elements they want from the mit or should they stay away from it without explicit or would it have been okay from the beginning was it unnecessary to try contacting mit the answer will also have implications for how i design my own so interested to find out what the so community has to for reusing elements of a web

was talking about this with someone here the other as we use stored procedures for all database access we were discussing linq in and the linq to sql iqueryable she quickly realized that using linq with sprocs would be redundant at best and difficult at advantages of linq to sql are that the code lives in one and what is occurring in the db is very in addition the development time can be depending mostly on as there is one less work product to advantages of as i see are also stored procedures allow for much better access control for a as they can inspect the sproc before and allow the application use access only to execute that sproc rather than access to all the tables this makes for much better reviews of database contention and performance the other advantage i see is that while linq to sql will generate a correct in the case of complex queries there are times where you hit a case that causes poor optimization on the db in those cases you would either rewrite the or provide hints to the both are breaking with the dba in a but have but i feel really nervous when working on a large high transaction load db and not knowing every possible statement that would be executed by a so sticking with sprocs

was under the assumption that stl functions could be used only with stl data containers until i saw this piece of namespace int cerr return compiles and runs without any warnings or errors with giving the correct output sum of such usage of arrays with stl functions by the if how do archaic structures like arrays fit into the grand stl plan of templated containers and are there any caveats or details in such usage that the programmer should be can arrays be used transparently with stl

was wondering how you would use the transactionscope class in the correct way when you are dealing with create a new scope in our main thread and then we spawn of a couple of worker threads and we want these to participate in the main so that for example the rollback is called on each worker if the scope is never read something about transactionscope using the threadstaticattribute internally which made the above impossible very difficult could someone verify either if we run out code in a syncrhonized fashion then the rollbacks the inner transactions are able to participate in the main but not if we switch over to a threaded and

was writing up this question and in the it forced me to think a little harder and i answered it though i still completely understand why it solved have an account on a shared host with 2 domains using the stack to run a few things like a blog and another site i am planning to kick off both of my domains point to the the first is the original i used to the second is a root domain pointer i here is how i want it to blog site2 be directed here if site2 junk if you type in or that behaves as expected and i am fine with for i have the rewrite rule configured like the rule is supposed to match any path if the host is pick off the path to the requested resource and format it so when somebody types in this resolves to without the user ever this is working as advertised except when the user does not type a trailing slash in a iis 7 looses its brain here and formats it out like because a 2nd request is automatically issued for the trailing slash and a 404 i updated the action to seems to have resolved but why iis 7 now spit out how does it know not to append a trailing slash to a document 7 url rewriting and two

way java finds the class in which to run void is by the name passed to the java executable the so not possible to have main run unless the right name was unless the main that is found calls something like or uses the class loader to find as main is static and static functions the whatever main is called is called because main was called on that so in your the name passed in the args to in just the name of the class that function is never an and so never need to find the

way to find these things out is to use the tool you can download from microsoft this tool allows you to view com type the type library the vendor of the com component provided type library contains information about the interfaces and the methods and properties of the com classes exposed by an application or on my i can view the type library for and see what com objects are exposed by and their properties and displays information in idl description which is more or less a c function prototype with extra attributes tacked is the idl declaration i got using for the hresult variant long the attribute on the this means it be displayed by most is a good hint to not rely on this method always existing microsoft could remove it in a later version of what about the here is the full pictures void unsigned long unsigned long void unsigned void unsigned int unsigned long void unsigned int unsigned long void long unsigned long unsigned short unsigned xlcreator void variant variant variant xlpictureappearance xlcopypictureformat variant variant void double void double void double void double void void bstr void bstr variant void variant void variant variant variant double void double void void double void double long void bstr void bstr double double double double long bstr variant variant variant you can surmise that the interface has a and as well as an among note that this interface is also marked which is a good indication that you really be using it i know you were ignoring that but i second mitch comment that generally a bad idea to use hidden because they are usually meant for the own internal use and are subject to change without

way we do it at my present company is to make sure is a not a web then you use names for the folders that would help identify it as the common ones that are distinct from the individual web instead of just your other web you create a virtual directory to the and add a file based reference to the requires you to use iis for development and visual studio believe that the controls really but it will work at and you can build just fine with only warnings about or path you do use common master pages and visual studio you will need sp1 for 2008 and use a in the root of the individual web projects to go in to design i saw this on another and i am going to look into doing more like

we can assume order of scores in the array is always in the order by then by the round number of rounds is same for each what we can do is print each score as we moved through the array while calculating the total in the process but resetting it if we see a new as check whether we have to move to a new if check whether we have anything to print resetting the if if for print reset the total and various variables for the new the last player is not printed because we exited the loop before the print so we need a print statement print round 0 round 1 10 7 6 12 should be quite efficient because it only goes through the array

we care about code that look at the number of changes made to a file how big the changes just how often a file gets and how many bugs were fixed by those changes plus the number of open bugs which are logged against the the result should be a number that gets bigger the more rotten a file which change often while not fixing a big will not show up because the bug part of the equation will be file with lots of open bugs will show up as will files where changes often lead to new the number should erode over time we care about old	
we have been using watin and mbunit for web integration testing for the past 3 have separated the tests into 3 contains glue code for setting up test fixtures and various custom mbunit and watin contains page and control classes arranged hierarchically into namespaces that correspond to different domains and parts of the this project serves to decouple tests from the major part of the web site you can think of it as a model of the contains the actual tests also arranged hierarchically into tests leverage the sitemap and framework as needed to interact with the web this way there is much less code duplication than if each test contained the same button ids over and

we send a packet from a udp port we receive an exception if the network returns an icmp host the exception tell us anything useful the contents of the icmp just listen for icmp and that will give us the info we while ignoring the exception on the udp open a raw listen for icmp packets and go from fine in development but in production on server 2008 it appears the security context the exe is running in must have admin rights to be able to open a raw this is useless for a if i understand what microsoft are saying then the only way we can do what we want is run our service under an account with admin feels a bit like sledgehammer for a peanut not to mention a potential security hole that goes with having a network facing service running under an admin really hope i am wrong here but i seem to find anything that contradicts the got any comments hints or an icmp packet in the context of a service on

web pun programming one would always take this approach because you depend on the validation actually a crafty user can construct a form post or url that simulates your client and sends data back to the a standalone it is less i would suggest that it depends on where the validation is for if your validation runs in your business not in your then your validation ought to run every using separation of the business logic depend on the ui to do after the business logic may be called from a typical a web or even an thing that i would suggest is that doubling up the validation logic in the is probably overkill but you ought to be able to handle errors arising from the underlying in this the errors might arise from

went through some testing with this as if you are loading a javascript file it is faster to put it at the end but it does come with some important first is that doing this often made some of my visual effects for if i was using jquery to format a the table would come up unformatted and then the code would run to reformat i find this to be a good user experience and would rather the page came up putting it at the end made it hard to put code in your pages because often functions exist if you have this in your that work until the jquery object is if defined at the end of your page the above will produce an you could argue that all that styling code could be put in the external file but that would be a mistake for performance i started off doing that on a project and then found my page took a second to run through all the javascript that had been so i created functions for the relevant behaviour and then called the appropriate ones in each reducing the javascript load run time to you can minimize the load time of javascript by versioning your javascript files and then using expires headers so only loaded once time at which point where they are in the file is largely all in all i found putting putting the javascript files at the end of the file to be cumbersome and ultimately

what you are describing can be achieved using	
what you created is not a variable an array whose size is not that array has an incomplete and can thus not be defined in what you can do is to make it just a declaration by putting before coords in the file that initializes you can then create that array beware you should do it at namespace outside any of what you want is an array whose size is not known at compile time but rather at you should use a coords later if you fill create a local array and then initialize the vector using a copy of the elements of that c sizeof c sizeof in it is slightly different than in you define an array whose dimension what happens is that taken to be a if at the end of the file of its translation which is that and all the files it includes meaning everything the compiler translates there is not a subsequent definition of it that includes the then the size is taken to be in there are no tentative and a definition that does not include the size and does not contain an initializer that can tell the size is an invalid the reason why your code goes you are the compiler will read set lhs to lhs is a variable of type rhs what the heck is the compiler has no clue what the right hand side is supposed to for that reason version of introduced compound it allows you to it will actually do what you want it to do creating a right hand side value of type and assigns it to the left hand but you should already from a compatibility reason c compilers are not reasonable c99 compliant and neither nor c89 supports compound use one of the previous ways i showed

workflow is useful for several different kinds of if not writing one of then no need to bother learning workflows can be useful for complex ui can be very useful as a way of processing several operations in a very easy way to do asynchronous operations consisting of multiple situation where you need to permit your customers to customize you can ship custom activities that pertain to your and customers can then combine and parameterize if you need any of why just read some of the or look at some of the videos and see if any of it looks interesting thing not both the workflow designer and the rules designer can be hosted in arbitrary windows forms this allows them to be reused in your own for you need a way to customize conditional

working on a flash project right now and i am having to force a designer into using our source control repository to help manage and track the been a bit of an uphill battle to fully get him to embrace the benefits of source but coming had to use source control for a flash project before other than on projects where i was the only person working on starting to discover there are some addition workflow pieces you need to implement around it so you have a nightmare fighting binary mostly working on the place all the actionscript files into external files so i can work on them while the designer works on the fla file with all the this seems to be working out but when i need to change instance names and the i have to make sure i communicate well so we run into any was wondering how other people handle flash in source control and how they manage the workflow so a developer and designer can be working on the project at the same source control best

working on a server application for a game engine writing in actionscript using an authoritative server model as to prevent cheating and ensure fair so everything works the client begins it tells the server and starts rendering the tells everyone else that client x has began among with details so they can also begin when the client stops it tells the which performs calculations based on the time the client began moving and the client render tick delay and replies to so they can update with the correct thing when i use the default 20ms tick delay on server when the client moves for a rather long a noticable tilt forward when it if i increase slightly the delay to on my local network everything runs very but in other the tilt is still after experimenting a i noticed that the extra delay needed is pretty much tied to the latency between client and i even boiled it down to a formula that would work quite delay 20 how would i procceed to obtain the latency between a certain client and the server using asynchronous the cpu effort be too as to not have the server run is this really the best or is there a more way to do do i obtain the latency between server and client in	
working on a video display device that uses custom timings for resolutions at848x480 and 800x480 that do not conform to any vesa the device has an edid that specifies these would like to know the process that windows xp uses to determine the resolution to display and how it presents the user with a list of this seems highly dependent on the video card manufacturer and have observed wildly different behaviors on different seems that vanilla windows xp does not query the edid except at boot however laptops and custom video drivers sometimes seem to query the edid at will in a computer with no hit presentation and the device name shows pcs seem to have no trouble generating 848x480 or but some just seem to ignore the detailed timings and fall back to a vesa if you specify a custom timing what is the chance that any given video will be able to generate the proper vga often the edid information will be transmitted to the but if you open the windows display and select the device in the settings the slider of available modes does not show either 848x480 or it usually just shows 640x480 among a list of other standard modes not the custom modes this then you can often get the device to display at 848x480 or 800x480 by selecting it in the list of all modes under display properties settings advanced adapter list all when you select it switches to the proper if you go back in to display properties you will see the mode you selected in the but the slider only has the one it should also show is this just a fact of life when dealing with windows xp and video it would be great to know exactly how windows populates that would greatly appreciate any resources that discuss the details associated with all of i know that this is not strictly speaking a programming but it is closely related to a programming problem that i am and i am having trouble finding any information on this does windows xp use a edid to determine allowable display

working on a win32 application for which trying to essentially if a device has been plugged into one of the rs232 ports and then if it has been checking for a connected device is easy enough because my use case allows me to assume that this particular thread will be the first to try to initiate communication with the able to scan the available ports every minute or so and once found a port with the device on it i flag that port has having a close the then set an event so that the process that actually will use the device knows it can now connect on that disconnect detect is where i run into when scanning for connected devices i can actually send data to the port to be sure if there is a the specific device looking but once that port will already be open by the other process and i can no longer open that port from the detect so i am looking for a way to either open the port in a or something like that so i can just see if the device is still briefly came across something about watching the dsr or dtr line or find any more or how to actually do looks like i need to clarify a little for detecting the i send data to the rs232 port any i cannot assume that another application actually has the port the device may be physically but without and open i still risk sending data to i was hoping there was a way to just check that there was still power on that port or something like if device is to rs232 port without opening the

works try we use it with in your updated you asked about using frameworks such as jquery with can you do would you want a more difficult in you let webforms generate javascript for why you have updatepanel and the on one this is because you can focus your coding attention on and you can use grid components which require you to write any javascript at all to make them on the other limited to what the generated code can you can write javascript even in but you have to work around some of the things the framework like changing ids on you can write event handlers in but this requires the use of which do not fit naturally in with consequences that are visible to the is common to use jquery with mvc in no small part because it ships with the but even before that it was still very common to use the two together because jquery makes it very easy to do things which are otherwise not directly supported within like making controls on a page interact with each this means you have to write but as long as ok with you get the huge advantage that you can write any kind of interaction you want to without having to postback to the you are just looking for a good grid control for then i would suggest using a control designed for rather than a grid designed for the reason is that the code you will write will fit more naturally within the idioms of you just want to learn a really good because the framework is and but not sure that a great control is the best place to a better place to start might be adding visual flair to some of your existing it is easier to start with known html and manipulate it with jquery than it is to be generating new html and learning jquery at the same	
world is wide open to you the only best practice is what works best for program the user is running can require the path to the properties file as an application can be configured to look in the current directory for the file be you could maybe fall back to the or fall back to wherever your application is i usually have my applications attempt to read properties files from the classpath but not in a world where i have the option you just make sure you clearly document it for your users so they know which file to edit and where it needs to

would argue that oop suits those who think in where an object consists of data as well as the functions that operate on that you tend to think of functions and the data they operate on as separate then you are a procedural you tend to think of functions and the data they operate on as being then you are an caution against going out and learning about in order to do programming you need to teach yourself to like an need to get to the point where you understand and can name the benefits vs and will help you to be a better programmer only in the sense that the more styles of programming a programmer the more range in his repertoire for solving problems and writing elegant you cannot go off and write all your code and automatically have good but if you really understand how oop and not just some popular design patterns of the then you can write some pretty good especially when writing a large	
would ask if your object absolutely has to be a if it to be a then make it a singleton and rely on your container to construct the problem you are having is because dependency injection relies on inversion of and singletons typically construct containers will take responsibility for the lifecycle of the objects they if yours you might be able to instruct it to only use a single instance of your if reading your question you really need a new instance of the objectwith each request since the state is different per use singleton as a last resort because it causes the type of problem that experiencing if you are locked in to that consider not injecting the service but passing it as a if you introduce it to have concurrency problems with multiple simultaneous requests needing different instances of the

would look at some it would involve training the classifier to recognize particular words as indicating probability that a product belongs to one of your for after being it could recognize that if a product description has in a chance that a hard whereas if it has a chance a a word like probably would end up not contributing much to any which is the way you want it to downside to this would be that it typically requires fairly large corpora of training data before it starts to work but you can set it up so that it continues to modify its percentages while being in production you notice that it classified something and it will eventually become very techniques are used quite heavily recently for so it might be good to do some reading on ways been used	
would love to have the ability to natively call regular expressions in sql server for ad hoc queries and use in stored our allow us to create clr functions so i have been using as a kind of poor query editor for the ad hoc it is especially useful when working with structured data such as json or xml that has been saved to the i agree that it seems like an oversight that there is no regular expression it seems like an obvious feature for a query hopefully we will see it in a future version but people have been asking for it for a long time and it made way into the product most frequent reason i have seen against it is that a poorly formed expression can cause which in will not abort and almost always requires the machine to be maybe once they address that in the framework we will see it included in a future version of sql

would maybe think about wrapping your user object in a seperate class then setting the datacontext properties of that contain the class public userinfo userinfo public userextendedinfo userextendedinfo in your binding for the usercontrol should be set in its but for clarity assumes that your userinfo class has a property of your userextendedinfo class has a property of locale and

would need to use pgp or something similar on the client side there are standards for signing and verifying signatures on messages and there are certainly commercial and free products for i would recommend using pgp on the and you can look up either a pgp library for java to use on the or you can check out how pgp wraps up the data to emulate that signing data is a standard and well documented albeit library for java has some openpgp you can check it out to see how compatible it is with a pgp implementation for windows or whatever the clients also has some openpgp support but that library was meant for java and been updated since i recommend you use bc

would open the spreadsheet with the excel com if you add a reference to the microsoft excel object you can get to the com these using you can read from the spreadsheet by doing something like private void string workbook application excelobj excelobj new theworkbook sheets sheets worksheet worksheet range range string data as todo store the code would read the contents of the a1 cell into a of the quirks of working with the excel com interface is that you have to access data in a even if you just want one you can set the range to be a group of then you can iterate over the collection that it returns to get the contents of each would also want to add some error on the file name and tab is also a way to use odbc to read from but the spreadsheet has to be formatted in a certain there has to be a header data in row found it easier to use the com you have acquired the data you you could put it into a typed then you could bind that dataset to a datagridview if using winforms or a listbox in if you just want to save the data in an xml you could use the dataset writexml function to store the data to a

would recommend rolling similar repositories into one so if creating an application roll up categoryrepository etc into something like catalogservice and have it host all repositories that are	
would recommend using only between your local and the remote between your local and local stick to standard git only you could possibly try a work flow like switch to and do svn pulls in changes from the remote and merges it with switch over to and do pulls the changes from and merges it with i think that it should just the local trunk and work on the clone	
would recommend using subsites or site collections for each meta project site can be defined which can rollup important information for the project the project site can then store more than just the but can become a focus for the project advice is that performance starts to suffer if you use more than site so there is some flexibility can swiftly become unmanageable when storing many documents as there is no good way of moving a subsite between content databases when a content database grows too think the site collection per project architecture will give you greater flexiblity and abvoid the nasty issues with complex lookup it will rely on some fairly clever use of the search results webpart	
would recommend using the following php it with your application loosens your requirements by not requiring the mbstring but you still get string ryan	
would recommend using the microsoft application blocks sqlhelper a statement like you have listed i can do the sql helper takes a few connection string to connect to the name of the stored array of parameter in the order in which they appear in the stored is a very slight performance drawback with this method over explicitly creating each but the time savings usually outbalances it since it is so

would say that this cmdlet written since it succeed it should have emitted an error object which would have caused to return false which you could have checked or you suppress the error message using it looks like this snapin is using the host api to write an error string to the host a for you could do what ebgreen t watch out for all the text your profile script spits out when a new instance of powershell starts	
would say the problem is that your base controller uses different data access basecontroller is hard wired to datacontext and that results in testability basecontroller needs to get data from why not to use repository in it as if ioc container is not you can inject repository dependency in inherited controllers and pass it to the way easy to create a mock for master page

would store a relative path in the this gives you the greatest loading images is a simple matter of prepending an variable should probably be to get the filesystem this is important because you might want to move where the images are stored them on a faster for then it is simply changing the configurable putting a reference to the image into a put the full this is simply adding a to the relative this gives you the advantage of being able to easily switch servers if you find load requires dedicated servers for serving	
would strongly advise against using short just reading your example shows how much more documentation is suddenly when names like fatajtw are at some point it will get pretty much unmaintainable and this just for saving some bytes to the only reason for considering names is to make the resulting script smaller and thus save some i would instead recommend using gzip which will save you way more than a few bytes for an

would suggest looking at the javadoc for the thread you have multiple mechanisms for thread main thread could the three threads and would then not proceed until all three are the thread state of the spawned threads at all of the spawned threads into a separate threadgroup and poll the on the threadgroup and wait for it to get to a custom callback or listener type of interface for sure there are plenty of other ways still	
would suggest not to use or or any other connection oriented go for a connectionless protocol or reason is if you require lots of small files to be uploaded or and the response should be as fast as you want to avoid the cost of setting up and destroying would suggest that you look at either using an existing implementation or implementing your own http or https

would suggest that you familiarize yourself with the history of i know that doing so has given me a much greater appreciation of what php is today and where it has come php was written by rasmus lerdorf to provide simple wrapper functions for the c code that was actually doing the so that he could have a simpler language syntax for writing templates that needed to behave the growth of php and the community which surrounds it is best described as and much like other things that grow its more than a little and downright you understand php and its you need to embrace php for everything that it is and everything that it is this idea was best presented by terry chay in his article without specifically talking about the concept of funky but he captures the concept of coding for php as if it were php and not favorite language better than anyone ever in other try to make php into etc because if you do fail and hate your a look at is php done the right must say that you must and always avoid the tendency of most beginning php developers to use the in other if you find that writing code that contains sql manipulation of validation of and html output all in a single php then doing it order to avoid it will be helpful to learn something about the nature of design this of course precludes a familiarity with but once learned the basics of programming in study the mvc design you have to implement this exactly but using the basic ideas of will allow you to avoid the blob script problem that most newbies tend to this i would strongly recommend that you take any code snippets you find on the web with a grain of and even if you find it in a book have to consider how old the book php as a language has advanced quite a long ways and you just take code samples at face value depending on their they may be using workarounds that were valid in or but simply are no longer necessary with newer great thing to do is to study the various frameworks out evaluate what you like and what you maybe even work up each of the quickstarts that are provided with the framework documentation so that you can start to get an idea of what you like and and i would strongly recommend that you review the code from the frameworks as well as several other projects so that you can get a feel for how others do things in take it all with a grain of salt because every php developer has their own pet peeves and nuances and none of us is right all the in most of the time with php there are going to be several pretty good ways to do you want to get a better understanding of the patterns that are being implemented by the frameworks and are commonly thrown around in the common vernacular on i would suggest that you read and teach all about the basic design patterns use in your development watch for the	
would suggest that you read the datagridview to do my bidding a tale of combobox first i was optimistic about the datagridview samples the datagridview but i see anything that did what i wanted to take an enum value and represent it in the grid with a how i did you should check out bind objects to windows forms datagridview following code example demonstrates how to bind a collection of objects to a datagridview control so that each object displays as a separate this example also illustrates how to display a property with an enumeration type in a datagridviewcomboboxcolumn so that the combo box list contains the enumeration	
would suggest that you take each of the above view write a and see which works best for you might find that for different applications or even for differnt types of view that the choice of view engine returning html to your client then an engine like spark might be if the conent returning is xml or some other markup for then spark be much nhaml is also focused on xhtml how you want to test your the skill set of your engineers developers and the level of support hoping to get from your view engine writer you find how you want those bug fixes and whether your customer has any try a see what you use a mixture of them if you find that makes and a good post that lists 4 alternative it mentions an xslt engine that might be appropriate if looking to generate	
would suggest that you use the original query object as you are looking to get inline query does not have any methods that allow you absolutely wanted to use you could mesh the two ideas and run an inline query to get the list of values and then use a regular and pass the retrieved values to the select case but then you would be making two trips to the a side note i prefer reading statements written using the fluent interface that it is	
would suggest using or the alternative much better for this sort of as they have libraries of image processing and convolution is a	
would suggest you look hard at the or and plan to use one or the other rather than roll your you should aim to use the system of terminal descriptions rather than the older see also the books and and my favourite title because i seem to spend a lot of time cursing when with that book is ancient 1986 and there are other more recent books on the same subject which would probably be better i still love the

would think one of two things is happening either your binding working correctly in both directions so either the persistence or the retrieval code is never storing these values in application level iso storage from two different applications something to that make sure your code is being hit in both cases and and make sure accessing the iso store from the same place using application level from the same

would you organize an entity that has 100s of one could go as far to say 100s of with a few value objects a few of the properties have 2 or 3 properties of their but the point how to handle the large number of am our model from the using and the current issue is how to organize one of main entities that is broken up into many many many currently it was written to have about a dozen of like with with of it as stored on a single entity it appropriate to have a service for the simple purpose of grouping a large collection of like carinfoservice that would return a along with a large collection or idea would be to look at how the data is there is no one view that shows all of this they are split up based on their subjective like carinfo shows all information about the another would be carstats that shows all stats of the so in this the application layer can build the underlying details needed for the i still need a way to store it in the have a mind to just put a number of xml property bags on it and call in the organizing 100s of properties on an

wpf use the installed color profile in windows for correcting the colors that are pretty sure old applications are not color but i wonder if wpf does can be made to this know i can do this manually in my own wpf apps by creating a gpu shader to do the color reason i ask is because more and more monitors are now wide this means that colors that look on monitors will seem much more vibrant on wide gamut an example is my new monitor which has much stronger red and green colors than my other can correct this problem on a basis for some applications media players using a custom shader my own wpf apps using gpu but it would be nice if there was a way to have wpf do it automatically for all wpf is not a big problem but it is however annoying and i had hoped that microsoft would take the opportunity with wpf to introduce color correction by question clarified for wpf use the installed color in

writing an application in python that requires me to use a dictionary as a data am curious as to whether or not it is more memory efficient to have one large or to break that down into many smaller then have an dictionary that contains a reference to all the smaller know there is a lot of overhead in general with lists and i read somewhere that python internally allocates enough space that the of items to the power of new enough to python that not sure if there are other unexpected internal like that is not apparent to the average user that i should take into of the difficulties is knowing how the power of 2 system counts is each counted as 1 seems important to know because if you have a 100 item monolithic dictionary then space items would be if you have 100 single item dictionaries then each dictionary would only be allocation no extra clearly laid out information would be very one large dictionary or a dictionary of smaller

writing to the 64 output be using many different memory if the bins are filled essentially at it means that sometimes have two bins that couls share the same cache not a big the core 2 l1 cache is that means get a problem only with the 9th cache with just 65 live memory references at any time associative is l2 cache is apparently associative so 12 that weird a so even if have collisions in chances are pretty good still not hitting main if you like the bins in instead of stroing each bin interleave for bin store chunks at offsets but store chunks at offset for bin store chunks at offsets this takes just a few bit shifts and but the result is that a pair of bins share 8 cache possible way to speed up your code in this case is especially in x64 get 16 registers x 128 and you can optimize the read to limit cache not sure if that will help a lot with the read though expect the core2 prefetcher to catch reading sequential integers is the most simple kind of access any prefetcher should optimize

you are using mvc is somewhat you basically have three options for this type of ui mechanic on a web the data in your lists is relatively small and infrequently it can be easiest just to all possible data on the page in the initial request either in something like a javascript array or hidden elements in the page when the value of box a javascript just replaces the contents of box b with the appropriate this all happens without any requests back to the server which makes it very but this method breaks down when the size of your data impacts the response time of the initial page the data in your lists is large or frequently changing the time frame a user would be on the page making a the legacy method is to just have the page get reloaded with the new query arguments when the value of box a code on the adjusts the output based on the new depending on how complex the rest of the rendering code in your page this can be is a variation on option 2 and is basically the answer gave regarding still loading the contents of box b on demand when box a the difference is that only reloading the piece of the page that has changed rather than the entire if your data is small enough to use option probably what i would go with due to its otherwise go with option particularly if already got other ajax related things implemented option 2 is seems to be considered a legacy mechanic by many people these

you can play signed urls in flash no reading around i have managed to answer a couple of my own questions yes not a good idea to sign urls from within flash as the secret key would need to be in the swf or loaded from php so could be a security risk it is probably best to call a php method on the server to generate a signed url and return the file to flash return the path to the file but this does seem like an extra step that could be bypassed still not sure about this but i think that the signing process involves using the path to the file so each signature for each url is unique is this have further advice on

you catching exceptions that you want to then filter more so you can then change your decide not to handle them and so rethrow you want to be really careful about not really a good better to never catch the exception in the first the reason is that a given handler should not take the decision to run nested blocks for exceptions that it is not expecting to for if there is a probably a very bad idea to continue executing any code as it will probably cause another such exception to be and blocks are just like any other as soon as an exception is caught for the first any blocks on the stack beneath the will be by which time too late another exception may be and this means that the original exception is implies that you have to careful write out a separate handler for all the exception types you want to it also implies that you can only filter by exception this is sometimes very hard advice to should be possible to filter exceptions in other but in it is it is possible in and the bcl itself takes advantage of this by having a small amount of code written in so it can filter exceptions in a more convenient a detailed with a code from the clr team my two

you choose a method where the content is hidden until the whole page is have it initially hidden in css then unhidden in if you do anyone with javascript disabled or unavailable will get no page at do both the hiding and the showing from note that the term really right for what doing implies that increasing performance by having the page fetched and cached so that ready to go by the time actually this is the it performance by waiting around showing the user nothing whilst the page is when partial content is defeating progressive rendering makes browsing not it is usually distinctly the wrong and except in a few niche cases going with the normal browser progressive rendering is this is how the web people are used to it by that except for the kind of management types who really use or understand the web but demand that their site appears all at

you dispose of it once just because we have street sweepers mean we should just go around littering the in the example if the font is needed for the lifetime of the object then dispose of the font in that there are many things that would simplify my code but that justify those changes sometimes there are things that you should even though a always a good idea to tidy up after when you no longer need dispose of that way you can avoid nasty race out of memory drawing and garbage find that best practice to dispose of disposable objects if you no longer need them unless there is a justifiable reason not to as you own the it is more difficult to track down the root cause of a problem than it is to code defensively up regards to call dispose before you release your last reference to the the resources it is using will not be freed until the garbage collector calls the font finalize say what the resources are but the fact that they explicitly state that this should be done implicitly adds importance to calling

you go with for web depending on your experience with web heartily recommend starting with mvc before web web forms is the original style of building and tries to abstract a lot of the it allows you to build applications without realising happening under the hood state in my these abstractions although making things easy at first begin to when you get into more complicated scenarios tutorial on the other hand makes it easier to build web sites that are a lot to the while still keeping you if you want absolute control over the resulting html and afraid of things like form post and query string then you might enjoy mvc a lot course it would be beneficial to know but if i was starting probably start with mvc and move to forms realise how bad it is and move back	
you go with it might actually be faster to just run the command once and get back all of the rather than running it for each of your executable there is some overhead for a and getting the you get back the have to loop through them in but this might be normally there be more than 100 processes running at so it be too you should write a test and check to see if is the best way to there really an equivalent getting a process list is pretty so the java designers must have decided not to this capability into the base java probably have to to get the results on or on

you happen to be in the then its a lot easier for an iphone developer to put their apps but if you are not from its a very frustrating especially if you are from a country which does not have its own happen to be from india and i have spent over 40 days just to ensure my card was i have faxed my docs over 7 times to usa and i must have emailed them over 30 times just to ensure my card was must have called their usa telephone number at least 5 and not even once did anyon e the answering machine keeps you on hold for over 30 long minutes and you finally have to disconnect coz you cant take it any more official email for dev support has never responded to a single email of thing to happen was i got an email from their australian office telling me my credit card was this was a big joke as my card has a balance of over 1500 usd and i use it all the time on american sites like amazon and i confirmed with my card bank hsbc and they said there was no attempt to charge my after many more phone calls and emails they charged the same card this time around its really surprising how it got rejected i am in the second phase to get a usa ein i have no clue how much more time apple would take just so that i can start selling my apps on the app i do not understand what on earth makes apple ask their developers to handle all these there are 100 other usa based companies which let u sell stuff online but you are isolated from all this legal way apple rejects app submissions is ridiculous the entire blogosphere has written stories of the they have no standard rules of rejecting your has to soon change the way its dealing with developers otherwise its not gonna take too much time for some other company to eat into its own reports suggest android is picking up market share right iphone is way ahead of the rest trust we live in a world today which is fast and least tolerant to such screw it wont take too much time for a google or for a microsoft or for couple of young smart college kids to roll their own version of the app store and kill app have been a microsoft developer for the last 8 and i have been hearing all sort of crap about of which perhaps is for a change i choose apple coz i sensed a big opportunity on the but so far its been very to microsoft has been a thousand times better than apple as far as developer support in india is no matter what people talk about the fact is on my own experience in last few no company matches microsoft when it comes to supporting their they make it super easy to download and preview their latest their documentation is top before the sdk comes the documentation is up and live on they have local groups in virtually every important city in india the worst policy apple has is as a you have to pay their payments are not on time to i can only hope apple realises that developers hold the key to getting mega bucks in the tech world

you have a set of elements when the page edit maybe you have something like this with do return what if you add a new element to this table after the page has initially you click on on this new nothing will happen because the events were bound on page enter with you can bind the event above like do return if you add any new elements with a class of after the page has initially it will still register this event how is this uses what is known as event delegation to achieve this event delegation is helpful in this situation or when you want to load a large amount of say you have a div with instead of 4 you have or or you want to bind a click event to images so that x action is performed when the user clicks on doing it as you might do then bind hundreds of handlers that all do the same this is inefficient and can result in slow performance in heavy with event even if you plan on adding more images using live can be much better for this kind of as you can then bind handler to the container and check when it is clicked if the target was an and then perform an to achieve the effect without with jquery knows that new elements can be added later on or that performance is instead of binding an event to the actual it might add one to the div like in the first example pretty sure it binds them to the body but it might to the container in the example and then this property can let it check after the fact if the event that was on matches the selector that you might have make it this is helpful not only in the direct way of not having to rebind but it can be dramatically faster for a large amount of

you have binary data like buffer want to initialize it like this out a that handles this populatebitset bitmap you want the raw use the populatebitset bitmap do end up allocating the needed memory so you might be better off with a stack allocation and a or you just can wait until and let the move semantics do their unecessary in populatebitset clarify why the first versions allocate twice as much a look at another way to write the first just to shorten the populatebitset bits const bits initialize bitmap copy over data from temp to you put these two lines as in the first you still get a temporary constructed on the followed by an in boost needs to allocate enough memory for the entire set of in boost needs to allocate again enough memory to hold that same set of bit and then copy the values possible that bitmap already has enough so it may not always need to but also possible that it will free its backing memory and reallocate from scratch containers that fit the stl mold also have a swap function that you can use in place of assignment when you intend to throw away one side of the these are usually and as they often just involve swapping some see this for another reason why these are be able to use and still get the advantages of since you can overload on the the container know that when you assign a it knows that it can cannibalize the temp and basically do a the visual studio team blog has covered rvalues and move semantics well

you have three it on the server and accept those i know from experience that things do go but depending on how and high priority the tasks doing it may be something you can live basically if you have to do try to do as little word integration as if just a mail merge then you will probably get away without any problems of the a but from except for simple these never do the job quite for example if talking about something that will generate pdfs from word documents on the it will never look the same as it does in of directly invoking use the to manipulate the documents even written stuff in vb6 that manipulates 2007 since all in documented xml you to use the 2007 but fast and but something like a mail merge have to do manually i so it may not be this solution is generally better for manipulating documents rather than replacing word api personal experience done the first and it worked well enough for our customer to i messed around with the second and was never and done the third with great success a fair bit of people do all sorts depending on cost suggest option 1 or 2 for a fast less or 3 for a more reliable

you need the bytes in an then all the methods are pretty much going to be the since you have to stream all the bytes from the result stream into the array sqlclient classes are going to do this for matter if you have a varbinary output parameter on a stored procedure or a field in a database although the stored procedure will be slightly faster since you have schema information about a result set to this is negligible compared to the size of the data you are shuttling you really want a performance you are better off using a datareader with sequentialaccess set and then calling getbytes on the reader for the field that is by calling you pull only the bytes you need and can process the data in is because you are definitely going to have issues trying to allocate an array of bytes 2mb in generally starting to allocate contiguous blocks of memory is what arrays is a bad and will kill where process the data in smaller	
you need the rows to remain if not unmerge to make it tagged it as vba but if this is a fix then is it ok to manually work on the a starting point i would suggest adding an identifier to each group of and depending on your data quality you could do this by checking the website or simply by counting for you could insert a new column before your data and put the following in cell b1 row could be description description and if it is a we assume that on this new row starting with a new block of data so take the organization if it a use the organization name we were using previously will need to then copy that formula down until the end and the 4 rows will at least now have a common key which you can then use to mash around the there are urls which just start then modify the formula or just to be so that your data quality has

you really want to toggle data sets within one it seems like a better approach would be to use a toolbar rather than a tab the tab bar is all about switching views where as the other poster all views have to be children of one view and one navigation having a tab bar that calls into this single controller to switch data sets make much more or else using a uisegmentedcontrol would also work well you have three elements and you can only have up to three helmstetter

you said it reasonably well right truth is that the comb is almost always a bad idea exception happening for example when marshaling or when for a short interval you may not have all the type information at as josh a sign of a bad class hierarchy way that you a bad idea is that it makes the code if you use and the type hierarchy then it probably breaks that comb everywhere it you then lose the benefit of strong the compiler help you by catching errors ahead of is somewhat analogous to the problems caused by typecasts in me extend this a since from a comment it appears i quite the reason you use a typecast in or it that you want to say use this as if it were a in there is no run time type information around at so just working without a if you typecast the generated code is going to treat that address as if it contained a particular type no matter and you should only that it will cause a error instead of silently corrupting typing just raises that to a in a weakly typed language like ruby or python or everything is an untyped you shoot messages at it at runtime and see what if it understands a particular it like a it handles can be very handy and because it allows marvelous hacks like assigning a generator expression to a variable in or a block to a variable in but it does mean vulnerable to errors at runtime that a strongly typed language can catch at compile a language like you have duck typing at you tell the compiler what type going to treat something you can get something like duck typing by using type so that you can do something a reference to an analogous to a void in some code that assigns something to some more at run fine as long as x is a kind of at or at otherwise or no your you protect yourself by using a comb of and object x code code code instanceof else if instanceof misslecontroller else if something else protected against the but got the responsibility of doing something sensible at the now imagine you make a change to the so that can take the types and you now must go through all the code and find all the instances of that comb and modify now the code is changes in the requirements mean lots of code in striving to make the code less oo solution is to use polymorphism which you can think of as a kind of limited duck defining all the operations that something can be trusted to you do this by defining a superior probably that has all the methods of the inferior in a class like that is best expressed an but it has all the type properties of a in you can see an interface as being a promise that a particular class can be trusted to act it were another public interface veeblefeetzer public class fooddispenser implements veeblefeetzer public class misslecontroller implements veeblefeetzer public class floorwax implements veeblefeetzer public class desserttopping implements veeblefeetzer you have to do now is use a reference to a and the figures it out for if you happen to add another class a subtype of the compiler will select the method and check the arguments in the a reference to anything that implements some code that assigns something to some more

you think about using for this is quite easy to index just what you and you can also think about writing your own parser for specific files format that are not managed natively by you should really think about such a solution since lucene offers quite an easy api to query the it is quite well documented and you can find a lot of resources about it on the as your problematic can interest a lot of people perhaps it can be a good start for an project to create a personal search this can be challenging interesting for a huge amount of people i i chose this going to write an application that does exactly what is probably using i expect the two main problems to be selecting what to index only in the wikipedia and to index compressed files without unpacking them completely index while as soon as i release it add a link thanks for all your

you use a language with garbage collection you wont get access to the memory rather you are given access to some abstraction on top of that one of the things that is properly abstracted away is the the actual location in memory of the data as well as pointers to other when the garbage collector runs happens it will check if you still hold a reference to each of the memory blocks it has allocated for if you it will free that main difference between the different types of garbage collectors is their efficiency as well as any limitations on what kind of allocation schemes they can simplest is properly reference when ever you create a reference to an object an internal counter on that object is when you chance the reference or it is no longer in the counter on the target object is when this counter reaches the object is no longer referred at all and can be problem with reference counting garbage collectors is that they cannot deal with circular if object a has a reference to object b and that in turn has some or reference to object they can never be even if none of the objects in the chain are refereed outside the chain therefore accessible to the program at mark and sweep algorithm on the other hand handle the mark and sweep algorithm works by periodically stopping the execution of the mark each item the program has allocated as the program then runs through all the variables the program has and marks what they point to as if either of these allocations contain references to other data in the that data is then likewise marked as is the mark part of the at this point the program can no matter how is marked as reachable and everything the program reach is marked as the garbage collector can now safely reclaim the memory associated with the objects marked as problem with the mark and sweep algorithm is that it that efficient the entire program has to be stopped to run and a lot of the object references going to improve on the mark and sweep algorithm can be extended with so called garbage in this mode objects that have been in the system for some number of garbage collections are promoted to the old which is not checked that improves efficiency because objects tend to die young of a string being changed inside a resulting in perhaps a lifetime of a few hundred or live very long objects used to represent the main window of an or the database connection of a more detailed information can be found on based on the mark and sweep algorithm well as any other garbage collection algorithm except reference the garbage collection do run in the context of your since it has to be able to access stuff that your program is not capable of accessing therefore it is not correct to say that the garbage collector runs on the

you use a there is also another way to access the application context without using singletons by using a servletfilter and a in the filter you can access the application context using webapplicationcontextutils and store either the application context or the needed beans in the if you forget to unset the threadlocal you will get nasty problems when trying to undeploy the you should set it and immediately start a try that unsets the threadlocal in the this still uses a the but the actual beans do not need to be the can even be and this solution also works if you have multiple wars in an application with the libaries in the you might consider this use of threadlocal as bad as the use of plain spring already provides a similar i did not find but i know for

you using a validation summary on your some javascript to automatically scroll to the top of the which may well override the automatic behaviour of the client side validation to focus the last invalid have you turned client side validation you take a look at the javascript generated by the client side validation you should see methods like if if if null the call to which is a rather long method that attempts to set the focus to the control in or if you have multiple to the last control that was using the following get this behaviour to you would ideally need to ensure that all your validators are set to be server side validators will obviously require a and that might affect things lose and setting maintainscrollpositiononpostback to true would probably cause the page to reload to the submit rather than the invalid form the server side method will cause to render out some javascript the page near the bottom of the but this could be being overriden by one of the other mechanisms dicussed

you want full type i think you can do better without some kind of wrapper why not make those classes the original generic like class foobbq extends eliminates the need for and it is more in my that it is just a type generic type can be cast into without a compiler it would be my personal preference to make if even if some code duplication would occur in without knowing concrete problem it is hard to say whether you say like in your or perhaps class extends the other have you thought about simply configuring java compiler not to show some of the generic and simply omit the parts of generic use strategically placed in other can you make only doableimpl implements ignore the warnings for the sake of less code hard to decide without a concrete but it is yet another thing you can

you want to see code for an existing the game programming gems 5 article referenced in the cowboy programming page comes with a somewhat stripped down version of the code we used for our component system did a fair chunk of the design and implementation of the system described in that need to go back and recheck the which i do right we represent things in a hierarchy in the way you although components lived in a class hierarchy in the runtime representation was a flat components just declared a list of interfaces that they the user could query for interfaces or concrete in your sprite and particle would declare that they implemented the renderable and if we wanted to do something to all just loop through the list of active components and check each not terribly efficient on the face of but it was fine in the main reason it an issue was that it actually turns out to not be a very common things like for added themselves to the render scene at so the global scene manager maintained its own list of renderable objects and never needed to query the component system for similarly with phyics and collision components and that sort of

you were to look at how a struct stores its it would be something like where your float is where your char is where your int is when you change the value of you are actually changing bytes when you change your you are actually changing byte when you change your you are actually changing bytes you now look at how a union stores its it would be something like where your float is where your char is where your int is when i change the value of i am changing bytes since c is stored in byte when you change you also change c and when you change changing part of f and a and when you change changing c and where your is when you pack the 3 values into the one memory not at just creating 3 different ways of looking at and changing the same you really have an a and a char in that union at the physical just got 32 which could be viewed as an a or a changing one is to change the if you want them to change each then use a is why gcc tells you that your struct is 9 bytes while your union is only 4 not saving space just that structs and unions are not the same

your original code you this case attachvideo is being called on a video see in your code where the video objects are but assume the second piece of code doing the attachvideo is being called on the videobutton not the video i think the reference to the stream will as your this variable will be the which as far as i can tell have that value defined reference within the is not the same as the this reference outside of think the call to fadein might also work as i think the scope will be messed something that might i tested it at but hopefully get the idea of what trying new new this essentially fixes the scope the value of i is properly due to the property of not really happy with i think the code should probably be refactored so that you have a single object per with members like i think that would make things a lot cleaner as you have to constantly be referring to the	
your other i guess you want to learn a new language to get new my advice is that the language is not really what is important is the quality of its community but also existing code you can read and learn and the available in this i think the is not the best choice for web libraries and frameworks are not portable and not and coding style of code you can study varies a lot and may confuse you a c is my favorite would advise to just learn and try to really understand the concept of then move to other languages more adapted to the web or javascript comes to mind or even in the c has the best mix of power and simplicity in my but is a niche

your producer you are likely to have some kind of main this is probably the best place to interrupt your instead of using and i suggest you use the java synchronization objects introduced in java could potentially do something like indexer lock lock new public void perform one indexing public item perform your need to make sure that each time the indexer releases the your index is in a legal in this when the indexer releases the it leaves a chance for a new or waiting operation to take the complete and release the at which point your indexer can proceed to its next if no is currently then your indexer just reaquires the lock itself and goes on with its next you think you might have more that one thread trying to do the lookup at the same you might want to have a look at the readwritelock interface and reentrantreadwritelock course this solution is the simple way to do it will block either one of the threads that have the you may want to check if you can just synchronize on your data structure but that might prove tricky since building indexes tends to use some sort of balanced tree or or whatnot where node insertion is far from being suggest you first try that simple then see if the way it behaves suits if it you may either try breaking up the the indexing steps into smaller or try synchronizing on only parts of your data worry too much about the performance of in java uncontended locking only one thread is trying to take the is as long as most of your locking is locking performance is nothing to be concerned

your scenario it seems that the actual creation of the object is being performed inside your so your first sample would be the correct your is stored in the and your is simply a reference to that new when you set listcustclass to the reference pointer of is discarded and replaced with a reference pointer to whatever returns be when this happens your original is still in the but no objects point to so its just wasting resources until the garbage collector comes around and cleans it sum it up everytime you create a new object then abandon like the second essentially wasting memory by filling the heap with useless

your strings are very either get your compiler to do it or manually unroll your loop and drop in a memory prefetch instruction or two every way while the cpu is the memory controller can be pulling in the next lines of you save the length of the string when you create it you can skip all the checks for the nul which means you can unroll your loop to operate in bigger chunks and reduce the number of compare and branch although with current branch it honestly make much with great cpu branch the loop will slow down if it has to check the loop counter every time through the loop to decide when to do a memory prefetch so unrolling is still helpful in that best performance the cpu does need to get the branches hinted and where profiling feedback comes in very otherwise the compiler is just making a somewhat educated	
your table is getting up to 1 tb in size and probably has lots of rows in i would strongly recommend not making the clustered index that much of dropping and recreating the clustered index will shuffle around all your data at least once that alone will take the big compound clustered index trying to create will significantly increase the size of all your indices they contain the whole clustered index value on each leaf for the bookmark question is why are you trying to do you just add another index with those to potentially cover your why does this have to be the clustered i see any advantage in more information on indexing and especially the clustered index see on sql server indexes very

your versions are correct except your remarks about the check for in version 1 and the reduced performance in version 3 are cause of the reduced is the way is particularly that it causes a write on every this is because a write though it actually change the data of or intention to cause its cache line to be invalidated on other which means that when another cpu waiting for the same tests it cannot read the data from its but has to get the data from the cpu that previously owned this phenomenon is called cache after the resemblance with the where the ball this case the constantly moves between the players if you add the extra test before the cpus will all just which means they can all have the data in their caches until somebody writes to happens in versions 1 and because they run on every iteration of the that the remarks about the extra check protecting against other thread incorrectly freeing it are not because the other thread must not do but because such a check guard against this even imagine that the other thread does but just after the locking thread does the if you really want to protect yourself against this kind of you should add another variable holding the thread id holding the and checking the correct manipulation with the lock with issue is that on some you need memory barriers to ensure good memory particularly ensuring that the test actually reads the value every time compiler barrier should be sufficient and that any read maybe write if you that occurs inside the critical section that performed by the cpu before the actual lock is unlock has to be handled note that jon version is correct in this because he uses java not but their semantics should be
